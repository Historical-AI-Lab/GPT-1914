The Last Chapter                                  312\n\n\n\n\nSIMON\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE SOLITARY PASSENGER\n\n\nThe train had come a long journey and the afternoon was wearing on. The passenger in the last third class compartment but one, looking\nout of the window sombrely and intently, saw nothing now but desolate\nbrown hills and a winding lonely river, very northern looking under\nthe autumnal sky. He was alone in the carriage, and if any one had happened to study his\nmovements during the interminable journey, they would have concluded\nthat for some reason he seemed to have a singularly strong inclination\nfor solitude. In fact this was at least the third compartment he had\noccupied, for whenever a fellow traveller entered, he unostentatiously\ndescended, and in a moment had slipped, also unostentatiously, into an\nempty carriage. Finally he had selected one at the extreme end of the\ntrain, a judicious choice which had ensured privacy for the last couple\nof hours. When the train at length paused in the midst of the moorlands and for\nsome obscure reason this spot was selected for the examination of\ntickets, another feature of this traveller's character became apparent. He had no ticket, he confessed, but named the last station as his place\nof departure and the next as his destination. Being an entirely\nrespectable looking person, his statement was accepted and he slipped\nthe change for half a crown into his pocket; just as he had done a\nnumber of times previously in the course of his journey. Evidently the\npassenger was of an economical as well as of a secretive disposition. As the light began to fade and the grey sky to change into a deeper\ngrey, and the lighted train to glitter through the darkening moors, and\nhe could see by his watch that their distant goal was now within an\nhour's journey, the man showed for the first time signs of a livelier\ninterest. He peered out keenly into the dusk as though recognising old\nlandmarks, and now and then he shifted in his seat restlessly and a\nlittle nervously. He was a man of middle age or upwards, of middle height, and thickset. Round his neck he wore a muffler, so drawn up as partially to conceal\nthe lower part of his face, and a black felt hat was drawn down over\nhis eyes. Between them could be seen only the gleam of his eyes, the\ntip of his nose, and the stiff hairs of a grizzled moustache. Out of his overcoat pocket he pulled a pipe and for a moment looked at\nit doubtfully, and then, as if the temptation were irresistible, he\ntook out a tobacco pouch too. It was almost flat and he jealously\npicked up a shred that fell on the floor, and checked himself at last\nwhen the bowl was half filled. And then for a while he smoked very\nslowly, savouring each whiff. When they stopped at the last station or two, the reserved and exclusive\ndisposition of this traveller became still more apparent. Not only was\nhe so muffled up as to make recognition by an unwelcome acquaintance\nexceedingly difficult, but so long as they paused at the stations he sat\nwith his face resting on his hand, and when they moved on again, an air\nof some relief was apparent. But a still more remarkable instance of this sensitive passion for\nprivacy appeared when the train stopped at the ticket platform just\noutside its final destination.",

      "passage": "Even as they were slowing down, he fell\non his knees and then stretched himself at full length on the floor, and\nwhen the door was flung open for an instant, the compartment was to all\nappearances empty. Only when they were well under way again did this\nretiring traveller emerge from beneath the seat. And when he did emerge, his conduct continued to be of a piece with this\ncurious performance. He glanced out of the window for an instant at the\nlights of the platform ahead, and the groups under them, and the arch of\nthe station roof against the night sky, and then swiftly stepped across\nthe carriage and gently opened the door on the wrong side. By the time\nthe train was fairly at rest, the door had been as quietly closed again\nand the man was picking his way over the sleepers in the darkness, past\nthe guard's van and away from the station and publicity. Certainly he\nhad succeeded in achieving a singularly economical and private journey. For a few minutes he continued to walk back along the line, and then\nafter a wary look all round him, he sprang up the low bank at the side,\nthrew his leg over a wire fence, and with infinite care began to make\nhis way across a stubble field. As he approached the wall on the further\nside of the field his precautions increased. He listened intently,\ncrouched down once or twice, and when at last he reached the wall, he\npeered over it very carefully before he mounted and dropped on the other\nside. \"Well,\" he murmured, \"I'm here, by God, at last!\" He was standing now in a road on the outskirts of the town. On the one\nhand it led into a dim expanse of darkened country; on the other the\nlights of the town twinkled. Across the road, a few villas stood back\namidst trees, with gates opening on to a footpath, the outlying houses\nof the town; and the first lamp-post stood a little way down this path. The man crossed the road and turned townwards, walking slowly and\napparently at his ease. What seemed to interest him now was not his own\nneed for privacy but the houses and gates he was passing. At one open\ngate in particular he half paused and then seemed to spy something ahead\nthat altered his plans. Under a lamp-post a figure appeared to be\nlingering, and at the sight of this, the man drew his hat still more\nclosely over his face and moved on. As he drew near the lamp the forms of two youths became manifest,\napparently loitering there idly. The man kept his eyes on the ground,\npassed them at a brisk walk and went on his way into the town. \"Damn them!\" he muttered. This incident seemed to have deranged his plans a little for his\nmovements during the next half hour were so purposeless as to suggest\nthat he was merely putting in time. Down one street and up another he\nwalked, increasing his pace when he had to pass any fellow walkers, and\nthen again falling slow at certain corners and looking round him\ncuriously as though those dark lanes and half-lit streets were\nreminiscent. Even seen in the light of the infrequent lamps and the rays from thinly\nblinded windows, it was evidently but a small country town of a hard,\ngrey stone, northern type. The ends of certain lanes seemed to open into\nthe empty country itself, and one could hear the regular cadence of\nwaves hard by upon a shore.",

      "passage": "\"It doesn't seem to have changed much,\" said the man to himself. He worked his way round, like one quite familiar with the route he\nfollowed, till at length he drew near the same quiet country road whence\nhe had started. This time he stopped for a few minutes in the thickest\nshadow and scanned each dim circle of radiance ahead. Nobody seemed now\nto be within the rays of the lamps or to be moving in the darkness\nbetween. He went on warily till he had come nearly to the same open gate\nwhere he had paused before, and then there fell upon his ears the sound\nof steps behind him and he stopped again and looked sharply over his\nshoulder. Somebody was following, but at a little distance off, and after\nhesitating for an instant, he seemed to make up his mind to risk it, and\nturned swiftly and stealthily through the gates. A short drive of some\npretentions ran between trees and then curved round towards the house,\nbut there was no lodge or any sign of a possible watcher, and the man\nadvanced for a few yards swiftly and confidently enough. And then he\nstopped abruptly. Under the shade of the trees the drive ahead was pitch\ndark, but footsteps and voices were certainly coming from the house. In\nan instant he had vanished into the belt of plantation along one side of\nthe drive. The footsteps and voices ceased, and then the steps began again, timidly\nat first and then hurriedly. The belt of shrubs and trees was just thick\nenough to hide a man perfectly on a moonless cloudy night like this. Yet\non either side the watcher could see enough of what was beyond to note\nthat he stood between the dark drive on one hand and a lighter space of\nopen garden on the other, and he could even catch a glimpse of the\nhouse against the sky. Light shone brightly from the fanlight over the\nfront door, and less distinctly from one window upstairs and through the\nslats of a blind in a downstairs room. For a moment he looked in that\ndirection and then intently watched the drive. The footsteps by this time were almost on the run. The vague forms of\ntwo women passed swiftly and he could see their faces dimly turned\ntowards him as they hurried by. They passed through the gates and were\ngone, and then a minute later men's voices in the road cried out a\ngreeting. And after that the silence fell profound. II\n\nTHE PROCURATOR FISCAL\n\n\nThe procurator fiscal breakfasted at 8.30, punctually, and at 8.30\nas usual he entered his severely upholstered dining-room and shut th\ndoor behind him. The windows looked into a spacious garden with a belt\nof trees leading up to the house from the gate, and this morning Mr.\nRattar, who was a machine for habit, departed in one trifling particular\nfrom his invariable routine. Instead of sitting straight down to the\nbusiness of breakfasting, he stood for a minute or two at the window\ngazing into the garden, and then he came to the table very thoughtfully. No man in that northern county was better known or more widely\nrespected than Mr. Simon Rattar. In person, he was a thickset man of\nmiddle height and elderly middle age, with cold steady eyes and\ngrizzled hair. His clean shaved face was chiefly remarkable for the\nhardness of his tight-shut mouth, and the obstinacy of the chin beneath\nit.",

      "passage": "Professionally, he was lawyer to several of the larger landowners\nand factor on their estates, and lawyer and adviser also to many other\npeople in various stations in life. Officially, he was procurator fiscal\nfor the county, the setter in motion of all criminal processes, and\ngeneralissimo, so to speak, of the police; and one way and another, he\nhad the reputation of being a very comfortably well off gentleman\nindeed. As for his abilities, they were undeniably considerable, of the hard,\ncautious, never-caught-asleep order; and his taciturn manner and way of\ndrinking in everything said to him while he looked at you out of his\nsteady eyes, and then merely nodded and gave a significant little grunt\nat the end, added immensely to his reputation for profound wisdom. People were able to quote few definite opinions uttered by \"Silent\nSimon,\" but any that could be quoted were shrewdness itself. He was a bachelor, and indeed, it was difficult for the most fanciful to\nimagine Silent Simon married. Even in his youth he had not been\nattracted by the other sex, and his own qualities certainly did not\nattract them. Not that there was a word to be said seriously against\nhim. Hard and shrewd though he was, his respectability was extreme and\nhis observance of the conventions scrupulous to a fault. He was an elder\nof the Kirk, a non-smoker, an abstemious drinker (to be an out and out\nteetotaler would have been a little too remarkable in those regions for\na man of Mr. Rattar's conventional tastes), and indeed in all respects\nhe trod that sober path that leads to a semi-public funeral and a vast\nblock of granite in the parish kirkyard. He had acquired his substantial villa and large garden by a very shrewd\nbargain a number of years ago, and he lived there with just the decency\nthat his condition in life enjoined, but with not a suspicion of display\nbeyond it. He kept a staff of two competent and respectable girls, just\nenough to run a house of that size, but only just; and when he wanted to\ndrive abroad he hired a conveyance exactly suitable to the occasion from\nthe most respectable hotel. His life, in short, was ordered to the very\nbest advantage possible. Enthusiastic devotion to such an extremely exemplary gentleman was a\nlittle difficult, but in his present housemaid, Mary MacLean, he had a\ngirl with a strong Highland strain of fidelity to a master, and an\ninstinctive devotion to his interests, even if his person was hardly the\nchieftain her heart demanded. She was a soft voiced, anxious looking\nyoung woman, almost pretty despite her nervous high strung air, and of a\nquiet and modest demeanour. Soon after her master had begun breakfast, Mary entered the dining-room\nwith an apologetic air, but a conscientious eye. \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" she began, \"but I thought I ought to tell\nyou that when cook and me was going out to the concert last night we\nthought we saw _something_ in the drive.\" Mr. Rattar looked up at her sharply and fixed his cold eyes on her\nsteadily for a moment, never saying a word. It was exactly his ordinary\nhabit, and she had thought she was used to it by now, yet this morning\nshe felt oddly disconcerted.",

      "passage": "Then it struck her that perhaps it was the\nred cut on his chin that gave her this curious feeling. Silent Simon's\nhand was as steady as a rock and she never remembered his having cut\nhimself shaving before; certainly not as badly as this. \"Saw 'something'?\" he repeated gruffly. \"What do you mean?\" \"It looked like a man, sir, and it seemed to move into the trees almost\nas quick as we saw it!\" \"Tuts!\" muttered Simon. \"But there was two friends of ours meeting us in the road,\" she hurried\non, \"and they thought they saw a man going in at the gate!\" Her master seemed a little more impressed. \"Indeed?\" said he. \"So I thought it was my duty to tell you, sir.\" \"Quite right,\" said he. \"For I felt sure it couldn't just be a gentleman coming to see you, sir,\nor he wouldn't have gone into the trees.\" \"Of course not,\" he agreed briefly. \"Nobody came to see me.\" Mary looked at him doubtfully and hesitated for a moment. \"Didn't you even hear anything, sir?\" she asked in a lowered voice. Her master's quick glance made her jump. \"Why?\" he demanded. \"Because, sir, I found footsteps in the gravel this morning--where it's\nsoft with the rain, sir, just under the library window.\" Mr. Rattar looked first hard at her and then at his plate. For several\nseconds he answered nothing, and then he said:\n\n\"I did hear some one.\" There was something both in his voice and in his eye as he said this\nthat was not quite like the usual Simon Rattar. Mary began to feel a\nsympathetic thrill. \"Did you look out of the window, sir?\" she asked in a hushed voice. Her master nodded and pursed his lips. \"But you didn't see him, sir?\" \"No,\" said he. \"Who could it have been, sir?\" \"I have been wondering,\" he said, and then he threw a sudden glance at\nher that made her hurry for the door. It was not that it was an angry\nlook, but that it was what she called so \"queer-like.\" Just as she went out she noted another queer-like circumstance. Mr.\nRattar had stretched out his hand towards the toast rack while he spoke. The toast stuck between the bars, and she caught a glimpse of an angry\ntwitch that upset the rack with a clatter. Never before had she seen the\nmaster do a thing of that kind. A little later the library bell called her. Mr. Rattar had finished\nbreakfast and was seated beside the fire with a bundle of legal papers\non a small table beside him, just as he always sat, absorbed in work,\nbefore he started for his office. The master's library impressed Mary\nvastly. The furniture was so substantial, new-looking, and conspicuous\nfor the shininess of the wood and the brightness of the red morocco\nseats to the chairs. And it was such a tidy room--no litter of papers or\nbooks, nothing ever out of place, no sign even of pipe, tobacco jar,\ncigarette or cigar. The only concession to the vices were the ornate ash\ntray and the massive globular glass match box on the square table in the\nmiddle of the room, and they were manifestly placed there for the\nbenefit of visitors merely.",

      "passage": "Even they, Mary thought, were admirable as\nornaments, and she was concerned to note that there was no nice\nred-headed bundle of matches in the glass match box this morning. What\nhad become of them she could not imagine, but she resolved to repair\nthis blemish as soon as the master had left the house. \"I don't want you to go gossiping about this fellow who came into the\ngarden, last night,\" he began. \"Oh, no, sir!\" said she. Simon shot her a glance that seemed compounded of doubt and warning. \"As procurator fiscal, it is my business to inquire into such affairs. I'll see to it.\" \"Oh, yes, sir; I know,\" said she. \"It seemed so impudent like of the man\ncoming into the fiscal's garden of all places!\" Simon grunted. It was his characteristic reply when no words were\nabsolutely necessary. \"That's all,\" said he, \"don't gossip! Remember, if we want to catch the\nman, the quieter we keep the better.\" Mary went out, impressed with the warning, but still more deeply\nimpressed with something else. Gossip with cook of course was not to be\ncounted as gossip in the prohibited sense, and when she returned to the\nkitchen, she unburdened her Highland heart. \"The master's no himsel'!\" she said. \"I tell you, Janet, never have I\nseen Mr. Rattar look the way he looked at breakfast, nor yet the way he\nlooked in the library!\" Cook was a practical person and apt to be a trifle unsympathetic. \"He couldna be bothered with your blethering most likely!\" said she. \"Oh, it wasna that!\" said Mary very seriously. \"Just think yoursel' how\nwould you like to be watched through the window at the dead of night as\nyou were sitting in your chair? The master's feared of yon man, Janet!\" Even Janet was a little impressed by her solemnity. \"It must have taken something to make silent Simon feared!\" said she. Mary's voice fell. \"It's my opinion, the master knows more than he let on to me. The\nthought that came into my mind when he was talking to me was just--'The\nman feels he's being _watched_!'\" \"Oh, get along wi' you and your Hieland fancies!\" said cook, but she\nsaid it a little uncomfortably. III\n\nTHE HEIR\n\n\nAt 9.45 precisely Mr. Rattar arrived at his office, just as he had\narrived every morning since his clerks could remember. He nodded curtly\nas usual to his head clerk, Mr. Ison, and went into his room. His\nletters were always laid out on his desk and from twenty minutes to half\nan hour were generally spent by him in running through them. Then he\nwould ring for Mr. Ison and begin to deal with the business of the day. But on this morning the bell went within twelve minutes, as Mr. Ison (a\nmost precise person) noted on the clock. \"Bring the letter book,\" said Mr. Rattar. \"And the business ledger.\" \"Letter book and business ledger?\" repeated Mr. Ison, looking a little\nsurprised. Mr. Rattar nodded. The head clerk turned away and then paused and glanced at the bundle of\npapers Mr. Rattar had brought back with him. He had expected these to be\ndealt with first thing. \"About this Thomson business--\" he began.",

      "passage": "\"It can wait.\" The lawyer's manner was peremptory and the clerk fetched the letter\nbook and ledger. These contained, between them, a record of all the\nrecent business of the firm, apart from public business and the affairs\nof one large estate. What could be the reason for such a comprehensive\nexamination, Mr. Ison could not divine, but Mr. Rattar never gave\nreasons unless he chose, and the clerk who would venture to ask him was\nnot to be found on the staff of Silent Simon. In a minute or two the head clerk returned with the books. This time he\nwas wearing his spectacles and his first glance through them at Mr.\nRattar gave him an odd sensation. The lawyer's mouth was as hard set and\nhis eyes were as steady as ever. Yet something about his expression\nseemed a little unusual. Some unexpected business had turned up to\ndisturb him, Mr. Ison felt sure; and indeed, this seemed certain from\nhis request for the letter book and ledger. He now noticed also the cut\non his chin, a sure sign that something had interrupted the orderly\ntenor of Simon Rattar's life, if ever there was one. Mr. Ison tried to\nguess whose business could have taken such a turn as to make Silent\nSimon cut himself with his razor, but though he had many virtues,\nimagination was not among them and he had to confess that it was fairly\nbeyond James Ison. And yet, curiously enough, his one remark to a fellow clerk was not\nunlike the comment of the imaginative Mary MacLean. \"The boss has a kin' of unusual look to-day. There was something kin'\nof suspicious in that eye of his--rather as though he thought someone\nwas watching him.\" Mr. Rattar had been busy with the books for some twenty minutes when his\nhead clerk returned. \"Mr. Malcolm Cromarty to see you, sir,\" he said. Silent Simon looked at him hard, and it was evident to his clerk that\nhis mind had been extraordinarily absorbed, for he simply repeated in a\ncurious way:\n\n\"Mr. _Malcolm_ Cromarty?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Mr. Ison, and then as even this seemed scarcely to be\ncomprehended, he added, \"Sir Reginald's cousin.\" \"Ah, of course!\" said Mr. Rattar. \"Well, show him in.\" The young man who entered was evidently conscious of being a superior\nperson. From the waviness of his hair and the studied negligence of his\ntie (heliotrope with a design in old gold), it seemed probable that he\nhad literary or artistic claims to be superior to the herd. And from the\ndeference with which Mr. Ison had pronounced his name and his own\nslightly condescending manner, it appeared that he felt himself in other\nrespects superior to Mr. Rattar. He was of medium height, slender, and\ndark-haired. His features were remarkably regular, and though his face\nwas somewhat small, there could be no doubt that he was extremely good\nlooking, especially to a woman's eye, who would be more apt than a\nfellow man to condone something a little supercilious in his smile. The attire of Mr. Malcolm Cromarty was that of the man of fashion\ndressed for the country, with the single exception of the tie which\nintimated to the discerning that here was no young man of fashion\nmerely, but likewise a young man of ideas.",

The indications, however, were not sufficiently\npronounced to permit one to suspect him of fiddling, or even of being\nabout to fiddle. This young gentleman's manner as he shook hands with the lawyer and then\ntook a chair was on the surface cheerful and politely condescending. Yet\nafter his first greeting, and when he was seated under Simon's\ninscrutable eye, there stole into his own a hint of quite another\nemotion. If ever an eye revealed apprehension it was Malcolm Cromarty's\nat that instant. \"Well, Mr. Rattar, here I am again, you see,\" said he with a little\nlaugh; but it was not quite a spontaneous laugh. \"I see, Mr. Cromarty,\" said Simon laconically. \"You have been expecting to hear from me before, I suppose,\" the young\nman went on, \"but the fact is I've had an idea for a story and I've been\ndevilish busy sketching it out.\" Simon grunted and gave a little nod. One would say that he was studying\nhis visitor with exceptional attention. \"Ideas come to one at the most inconvenient times,\" the young author\nexplained with a smile, and yet with a certain hurried utterance not\nusually associated with smiles, \"one just has to shoot the bird when he\nhappens to come over your head, don't you know, you can't send in\nbeaters after that kind of fowl, Mr. Rattar. And when he does come out,\nthere you are! You have to make hay while the sun shines.\" Again the lawyer nodded, and again he made no remark. The apprehension\nin his visitor's eye increased, his smile died away, and suddenly he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"For God's sake, Mr. Rattar, say something! I meant honestly to pay you\nback--I felt sure I could sell that last thing of mine before now, but\nnot a word yet from the editor I sent it to!\" Still there came only a guarded grunt from Simon and the young man went\non with increasing agitation. \"You won't give me away to Sir Reginald, will you? He's been damned\ncrusty with me lately about money matters, as it is. If you make me\ndesperate----!\" He broke off and gazed dramatically into space for a\nmoment, and then less dramatically at his lawyer. Silent Simon was proverbially cautious, but it seemed to his visitor\nthat his demeanour this morning exceeded all reasonable limits. For\nnearly a minute he answered absolutely nothing, and then he said very\nslowly and deliberately:\n\n\"I think it would be better, Mr. Cromarty, if you gave me a brief,\nexplicit statement of how you got into this mess.\" \"Dash it, you know too well--\" began Cromarty. \"It would make you realise your own position more clearly,\" interrupted\nthe lawyer. \"You want me to assist you, I take it?\" \"Rather--if you will!\" \"Well then, please do as I ask you.

Ha, ha!\" The young\nman laughed in a superior way and then looked apprehensively at the\nother. \"But I suppose you agree with Sir Reginald?\" Simon pursed his lips and made a non-committal sound. \"Well, anyhow, he wanted me to be called to the Bar or something of that\nkind, and then there was a fuss about money--his ideas of an allowance\nare rather old fashioned, as you know. And then you were good enough to\nhelp me with that loan, and--well, that's all, isn't it?\" Mr. Rattar had been listening with extreme attention.

      "passage": "Mr. Cromarty of\nStanesland stood about 6 feet two and had nothing artistic in his\nappearance, being a lean strapping man in the neighbourhood of forty,\nwith a keen, thin, weather-beaten face chiefly remarkable for its\nstraight sharp nose, compressed lips, reddish eye-brows, puckered into a\nslight habitual frown, and the fact that the keen look of the whole was\nexpressed by only one of his eyes, the other being a good imitation but\nunmistakeably glass. The whole effect of the face, however, was\nsingularly pleasing to the discerning critic. An out of door, reckless,\nhumorous, honest personality was stamped on every line of it and every\nmovement of the man. When he spoke his voice had a marked tinge of the\ntwang of the wild west that sounded a little oddly on the lips of a\ncountry gentleman in these northern parts. He wore an open flannel\ncollar, a shooting coat, well cut riding breeches and immaculate leather\nleggings, finished off by a most substantial pair of shooting boots. Unlike Mr. Malcolm Cromarty, he evidently looked upon his visit as\nexpected. \"Good morning, Mr. Rattar,\" said he, throwing his long form into the\nclients' chair as he spoke. \"Well, I guess you've got some good advice\nfor me this morning.\" Simon Rattar was proverbially cautious, but to-day his caution struck\nhis visitor as quite remarkable. \"Um,\" he grunted. \"Advice, Mr. Cromarty? Umph!\" \"Don't trouble beating about the bush,\" said the tall man. \"I've been\nfiguring things out myself and so far as I can see, it comes to\nthis:--that loan from Sir Reginald put me straight in the meantime, but\nI've got to cut down expense all round to keep straight, and I've got to\npay him back. Of course you know his way when it's one of the clan he's\ndealing with. 'My dear Ned, no hurry whatever. If you send my heir a\ncheque some day after I'm gone it will have the added charm of\nsurprise!' Well, that's damned decent, but hardly business. I want to\nget the whole thing off my chest. Got the statement made up?\" Simon shook his head. \"Very sorry, Mr. Cromarty. Haven't had time yet.\" \"Hell!\" said Mr. Cromarty, though in a cheerful voice, and then added\nwith an engaging smile, \"Pardon me, Mr. Rattar. I'm trying to get\neducated out of strong language, but, Lord, at my time of life it's not\nso damned--I mean dashed easy!\" Even Simon Rattar's features relaxed for an instant into a smile. \"And who is educating you?\" he enquired. Mr. Cromarty looked a little surprised. \"Who but the usual lady? Gad, I've told you before of my sister's well\nmeant efforts. It's a stiff job making a retired cow puncher into a high\ngrade laird. However, I can smoke without spitting now, which is a step\non the road towards being a Lord Chesterfield.\" He smiled humorously, stretched out his long legs and added:\n\n\"It's a nuisance, your not having that statement ready. When I've got to\ndo business I like pushing it through quick. That's an American habit I\ndon't mean to get rid of, Mr. Rattar.\" Mr. Rattar nodded his approval. \"Certainly not,\" said he.",

You see,\nwhen both my civilised elder brothers died----\" he broke off, and then\nadded: \"But you know the whole story.\" \"I would--er--like to refresh my memory,\" said Simon; and there seemed\nto be a note of interest and almost of eagerness in his voice that\nappeared to surprise his visitor afresh. \"First time I ever heard of your memory needing refreshing!\" laughed his\nvisitor. \"Well, you know how I came back from the wild and woolly west\nand tried to make a comfortable home for Lilian. We were neither of us\nlikely to marry at our time of life, and there were just the two of us\nleft, and we'd both of us knocked about quite long enough on our own,\nand so why not settle down together in the old place and be comfortable? At least that's how it struck me. Of course, as you know, we hadn't met\nfor so long that we were practically strangers and she knew the ways of\ncivilisation better than me, and I gave her a pretty free hand in\nsetting up the establishment. I don't blame her, mind you, for setting\nthe pace a bit too fast to last. My own blamed fault entirely. However,\nwe aren't in a very deep hole, thank the Lord. In fact if I hadn't got\nto pay Sir Reginald back the \u00a31,200 it would be all right, so far I can\nfigure out. But I want your exact statement, Mr. Rattar, and as quick as\nyou can let me have it.\" Simon nodded and grunted. \"You'll get it.\" And then he added: \"I think I can assure you there is\nnothing to be concerned about.\" Ned Cromarty smiled and a reckless light danced for a moment in his one\nefficient eye. \"I guess I almost wish there were something to be concerned about! Sir\nReginald is always telling me I'm the head of the oldest branch of the\nwhole Cromarty family and it's my duty to live in the house of my\nancestors and be an ornament to the county, and all the rest of it. But\nI tell you it's a damned quiet life for a man who's had his eye put out\nwith a broken whisky bottle and hanged the man who did it with his own\nhands!\" \"Hanged him!\" exclaimed the lawyer sharply. \"Oh, it wasn't merely for the eye. That gave the performance a kind of\nrelish it would otherwise have lacked, being a cold-blooded ceremony and\na little awkward with the apparatus we had. We hanged him for murder, as\na matter of fact. Now, between ourselves, Mr. Rattar, we don't want to\ncrab our own county, but you must confess that real good serious crime\nis devilish scarce here, eh?\"",

He seemed, however, to be affected unpleasantly and even a little\nstartled. \"I--I trust we don't,\" he said. \"Well,\" his visitor agreed, \"as it means that something or somebody has\ngot to be sacrificed to start the sport of man-hunting, I suppose\nthere's something to be said for the quiet life. But personally I'd\nsooner be after men than grouse, from the point of view of getting\nthorough satisfaction while it lasts.

Before either spoke again, the door opened and the clerk, seeing Mr.\nRattar was still engaged, murmured a \"beg pardon\" and was about to\nretire again. \"What is it?\" asked the lawyer. \"Miss Farmond is waiting to see you, sir.\" \"I'll let you know when I'm free,\" said Simon. Had his eye been on his visitor as his clerk spoke, he might have\nnoticed a curious commentary on Mr. Cromarty's professed lack of\ninterest in womankind. His single eye lit up for an instant and he\nmoved sharply in his chair, and then as suddenly repressed all sign of\ninterest. A minute or two later the visitor jumped up. \"Well,\" said he, \"I guess you're pretty busy and I've been talking too\nlong as it is. Let me have that statement as quick as you like. Good\nmorning!\" He strode to the door, shut it behind him, and then when he was on the\nlanding, his movements became suddenly more leisurely. Instead of\nstriding downstairs he stood looking curiously in turn at each closed\ndoor. It was an old fashioned house and rather a rabbit warren of an\noffice, and it would seem as though for some reason he wished to leave\nno door unwatched. In a moment he heard the lawyer's bell ring and very\nslowly he moved down a step or two while a clerk answered the call and\nwithdrew. And then he took a cigar from his case, bit off the end, and\nfelt for matches; all this being very deliberately done, and his eye\nfollowing the clerk. Thus when a girl emerged from the room along a\npassage, she met, apparently quite accidentally, Mr. Cromarty of\nStanesland. At the first glance it was quite evident that the meeting gave more\npleasure to the gentleman than to the lady. Indeed, the girl seemed too\ndisconcerted to hide the fact.",

It was a rather pale but fresh\nand clear-skinned face, wide at the forehead and narrowing to a firm\nlittle chin, with long-lashed expressive eyes, and a serious expression\nin repose.

I knew she hadn't always been happy and that her trouble had\nsomething to do with my father, simply because she hardly ever mentioned\nhim. But she lived at Eastbourne just like plenty of other widows and we\nhad a few friends, though never very many, and I was very happy at\nschool, and so I never troubled much about things.\" \"And knew nothing up till six months ago?\" asked Simon, who was\nfollowing her story very attentively. \"Nothing at all. Then, about a month after mother's death, I got a note\nfrom you asking me to go up to London and meet Sir Reginald Cromarty. I\nhad never even heard of him before! Well, I went and he was simply as\nkind as--well, as he always is to everybody, and said he was a kind of\nconnection of my family and asked me to pay them a long visit to\nKeldale.\" \"How long ago precisely was that?\" She looked a little surprised. \"Oh, you know exactly. Almost just four months ago, wasn't it?\" He nodded, but said nothing, and she went on:\n\n\"From the very first it had seemed very strange that I had never heard a\nword about the Cromartys from mother, and as soon as I got to Keldale\nand met Lady Cromarty, I felt sure there was something wrong. I mean\nthat I wasn't an ordinary distant relation. For one thing they never\nspoke of our relationship and exactly what sort of cousins we were, and\nconsidering how keen Sir Reginald is on his pedigree and all his\nrelations and everybody, that alone made me certain I wasn't the\nordinary kind. That was obvious, wasn't it?\" \"It seems so,\" the lawyer admitted cautiously. \"Of course it was! Well, one day I happened to be looking over an old\nphotograph album and suddenly I saw my father's photograph! Mother had a\nminiature of him--I have it still, and I was certain it was the same\nman. I pulled myself together and asked Sir Reginald in a very ordinary\nvoice who that was, and I could see that both he and Lady Cromarty\njumped a little. He had to tell me it was his brother Alfred and I\ndiscovered he had long been dead, but I didn't try to get any more\ninformation from them. I applied to Bisset.\" She gave a little laugh and looked at him with a touch of defiance. His\ninscrutable countenance appeared to annoy her. \"Well?\" he remarked. \"Perhaps you think I oughtn't to have gone to a butler about such a\nthing, but Bisset is practically one of the family and I didn't give him\nthe least idea of what I was after.",

What is the use in not telling me simply\nwhether I have guessed right!\" Silent Simon's face remained a mask. \"What precisely did you guess?\" \"That my mother wasn't married,\" she said, her voice falling very low,\n\"and I am really Sir Reginald's niece though he never can acknowledge\nit--and I don't want him to! But I do want to be sure. Dear Mr. Rattar,\nwon't you tell me?\" Dear Mr. Rattar never relaxed a muscle. \"Your guess seems very probable,\" he admitted. \"But tell me definitely.\" \"Why?\" he enquired coldly. \"Oh, have you no _curiosity_ yourself--especially about who your parents\nwere; supposing you didn't know?\" \"Then it's only out of curiosity that you enquired?\" \"Only!\" she repeated with a world of woman's scorn. \"But what sort of\nmotives did you expect? I have walked in the whole way this morning just\nto end the suspense of wondering! Of course, I'll never tell a soul you\ntold me.\" She threw on him a moving smile. \"You needn't actually tell me outright. Just use some legal\nword--'Alibi' if I am right and 'forgery' if I'm wrong!\" Silent Simon's sudden glance chilled her smile. She evidently felt she\nhad been taking the law in vain. \"I only meant----\" she began anxiously. \"I must consult Sir Reginald,\" he interrupted brusquely. She made no further effort. That glance seemed to have subdued her\nspirit. \"I am sorry I have bothered you,\" she said as she went. As the door closed behind her, Mr. Rattar took out his handkerchief and\nwiped his brow and his neck. And then he fell to work again upon the\nrecent records of the firm. Yet, absorbed though he seemed, whenever a\ndoor opened or shut sharply or a step sounded distinctly outside his\nroom, he would look up quickly and listen, or that expression would come\ninto his eye which both Mary MacLean and Mr. Ison had described as the\nlook of one who was watched. VI\n\nAT NIGHT\n\n\nWhen Simon Rattar came to his present villa, he brought from his old\nhouse in the middle of the town (which had been his father's before him)\na vast accumulation of old books and old papers. Being a man who never\nthrew away an opportunity or anything else, and also a person of the\nutmost tidyness, he compromised by keeping this litter in the spare\nrooms at the top of the house. In fact Simon was rather pleased at\ndiscovering this use for his superfluous apartments, for he hated\nwasting anything. On this same morning, just before he started for his office, he had\nagain called his housemaid and given her particular injunctions that\nthese rooms were not to be disturbed during the day. He added that this\nwas essential because he expected a gentleman that evening who would be\ngoing through some of the old papers with him. Perhaps it was the vague feeling of disquiet which possessed Mary\nMacLean this morning that made his injunction seem a little curious.",

Indeed, she felt a little\naggrieved at the command, and in the course of the morning she made a\ndiscovery that seemed to her a further reflection on her discretion. When she came to dust the passage in which these rooms opened her eye\nwas at once caught by a sheet of white paper pinned to each of the three\ndoors. On each of these sheets was written in her master's hand the\nwords \"This room not to be entered. Papers to be undisturbed.\" The\nresult was a warning to those who take superfluous precautions. Under\nordinary circumstances Mary would never have thought of touching the\nhandles of those doors. Now, she looked at them for a few moments and\nthen tried the handle nearest to her. The door was locked. She tried the\nsecond and the third, and they stood locked too. And the three keys had\nall been removed. \"To think of the master locking the doors!\" said she to herself after\nfailing at each in turn. \"As if I'd have tried to open them!\" That top storey was of the semi-attic kind, with roofs that sloped\nand a sky-light in one of them and the slates close overhead. It was\na grey windy morning, and as she stood there, alone in that large\nhouse save for the cook far away in the kitchen, with a loose slate\nrattling in the gusts, and a glimpse of clouds driving over the\nsky-light, she began all at once to feel uncomfortable. Those locked\ndoors were uncanny--something was not as it should be; there was a\nsinister moan in the wind; the slate did not rattle quite like an\nordinary slate. Tales of her childhood, tales from the superstitious\nwestern islands, rushed into her mind. And then, all at once, she\nheard another sound. She heard it but for one instant, and then with\na pale face she fled downstairs and stood for a space in the hall\ntrembling and wondering. She wondered first whether the sound had really come from behind the\nlocked doors, and whether it actually was some one stealthily moving. She wondered next whether she could bring herself to confide in cook\nand stand Janet's cheerful scorn. She ended by saying not a word, and\nwaiting to see what happened when the master came home. He returned as usual in time for a cup of tea. It was pretty dark by\nthen and Mary was upstairs lighting the gas (but she did not venture up\nto the top floor). She heard Mr. Rattar come into the hall, and then,\nquite distinctly this time, she heard overhead a dull sound, a kind of\ngentle thud. The next moment she heard the master running upstairs, and\nwhen he was safely past she ran even more swiftly down and burst into\nthe kitchen. \"There's something in yon top rooms!\" she panted. \"There's something in your top storey!\" snapped cook; and poor Mary said\nno more. When she brought his tea in to Mr. Rattar, she seemed to read in his\nfirst glance at her the same expression that had disturbed her in the\nmorning, and yet the next moment he was speaking in his ordinary grumpy,\nlaconic way. \"Have you noticed rats in the house?\" he asked. \"Rats, sir!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh, no, sir, I don't think there are any\nrats.\"",

      "passage": "\"I saw one just now,\" he said. \"If we see it again we must get some rat\npoison.\" So it had only been a rat! Mary felt vastly relieved; and yet not\naltogether easy. One could not venture to doubt the master, but it was\na queer-like sound for a rat to make. Mr. Rattar had brought back a great many papers to-day, and sat\nengrossed in them till dinner. After dinner he fell to work again, and\nthen about nine o'clock he rang for her and said:\n\n\"The gentleman I expect this evening will probably be late in coming. Don't sit up. I'll hear him and let him in myself. We shall be working\nlate and I shall be going upstairs about those papers. If you hear\nanybody moving about, it will only be this gentleman and myself.\" This was rather a long speech for silent Simon, and Mary thought it\nconsiderate of him to explain any nocturnal sounds beforehand; unusually\nconsiderate, in fact, for he seldom went out of his way to explain\nthings. And yet those few minutes in his presence made her uncomfortable\nafresh. She could not keep her eyes away from that red cut on his chin. It made him seem odd-like, she thought. And then as she passed through\nthe hall she heard faintly from the upper regions that slate rattling\nagain. At least it was either the slate or--she recalled a story of her\nchildhood, and hurried on to the kitchen. She and the cook shared the same bedroom. It was fairly large with two\nbeds in it, and along with the kitchen and other back premises it was\nshut off from the front part of the house by a door at the end of the\nhall. Cook was asleep within ten minutes. Mary could hear her heavy\nbreathing above the incessant droning and whistling of the wind, and she\nenvied her with all her Highland heart. In her own glen people would\nhave understood how she felt, but here she dared not confess lest she\nwere laughed at. It was such a vague and nameless feeling, a sixth sense\nwarning her that all was not well; that _something_ was in the air. The\nlonger she lay awake the more certain she grew that evil was afoot; and\nyet what could be its shape? Everything in that quiet and respectable\nhousehold was going on exactly as usual; everything that any one else\nwould have considered material. The little things she had noticed would\nbe considered absurd trifles by the sensible. She knew that as well as\nthey. She thought she had been in bed about an hour, though the time passed so\nslowly that it might have been less, when she heard, faintly and gently,\nbut quite distinctly, the door from the hall into the back premises\nbeing opened. It seemed to be held open for nearly a minute, as though\nsome one were standing there listening. She moved a little and the bed\ncreaked; and then, as gently as it had been opened, the door was closed\nagain. Had the intruder come through or gone away? And could it only be\nthe master, doing this curious thing, or was it some one--or\nsomething--else? Dreadful minutes passed, but there was not a sound of\nany one moving in the back passage, or the kitchen, and then in the\ndistance she could hear the grating noise of the front door being opened\nand the rush of wind that accompanied it.",

Another voice replied, gruff and\nmuffled and indistinct, and then again the master spoke. Evidently the\nlate caller had arrived, and a moment later she heard the library door\nshut, and it was plain that he and Mr. Rattar were closeted there. They seemed to remain in the library about a quarter of an hour before\nthe door opened again, and in a moment the stairs were creaking faintly. Evidently one or both were going up for the old papers. All this was exactly what she had been led to expect, and ought to\nhave reassured her, yet, for no reason at all, the conviction remained\nas intense and disturbing as ever, that something unspeakable was\nhappening in this respectable house. The minutes dragged by till quite\nhalf an hour must have passed, and then she heard the steps descending. They came down very slowly this time, and very heavily. The obvious\nexplanation was that they were bringing down one of those boxes filled\nwith dusty papers which she had often seen in the closed rooms; yet\nthough Mary knew perfectly that this was the common sense of the matter,\na feeling of horror increased till she could scarcely refrain from\ncrying out. If cook had not such a quick temper and such a healthy\ncontempt for this kind of fancy, she would have rushed across to her\nbed; but as it was, she simply lay and trembled. The steps sounded still heavy but more muffled on the hall carpet,\nthough whether they were the steps of one man or two she could not feel\nsure. And then she heard the front door open again and then close; so\nthat it seemed plain that the visitor had taken the box with him and\ngone away. And with this departure came a sense of relief, as devoid of\nrational foundation as the sense of horror before. She felt at last that\nif she could only hear the master going upstairs to bed, she might go to\nsleep. But though she listened hard as she lay there in the oppressive dark,\nshe heard not another sound so long as she kept awake, and that was for\nsome time, she thought. She did get off at last and had been asleep she\nknew not how long when she awoke drowsily with a confused impression\nthat the front door had been shut again. How late it was she could but\nguess--about three or four in the morning her instinct told her. But\nthen came sleep again and in the morning the last part of her\nrecollections was a little uncertain. At breakfast the master was as silently formidable as ever and he never\nsaid a word about his visitor. When Mary went to the top floor later the\npapers were off the doors and the keys replaced. VII\n\nTHE DRIVE HOME\n\n\nUnder the grey autumnal sky Miss Cicely Farmond drove out of the town\nwrapped in Ned Cromarty's overcoat. He assured her he never felt cold,\nand as she glanced a little shyly up at the strapping figure by her\nside, she said to herself that he certainly was the toughest looking man\nof her acquaintance, and she felt a little less contrition for the loan. She was an independent young lady and from no one else would she have\naccepted such a favour, but the laird of Stanesland had such an off-hand\nauthoritative way with him that, somewhat to her own surprise, she had\nprotested--and submitted.

Ned glanced down at her. \"Are you in a hurry?\" he enquired. \"Not particularly,\" she admitted. \"No more am I,\" said he, and this time he smiled down at her in a very\nfriendly way. So far they had talked casually on any indifferent subject that came to\nhand, but now his manner grew a little more intimate. \"Are you going to stay on with the Cromartys long?\" he asked. \"I am wondering myself,\" she confessed. \"I hope you will,\" he said bluntly. \"It is very kind of you to say so,\" she said smiling at him a little\nshyly. \"I mean it. The fact is, Miss Farmond, you are a bit of a treat.\" The quaintness of the phrase was irresistible and she laughed outright. \"Am I?\" \"It's a fact,\" said he, \"you see I live an odd lonely kind of life here,\nand for most of my career I've lived an odd lonely kind of life too, so\nfar as girls were concerned. It may sound rum to you to hear a backwood\nhunks of my time of life confessing to finding a girl of your age a bit\nof a treat, but it's a fact.\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"I should have thought I must seem rather young and\nfoolish.\" \"Lord, I don't mean that!\" he exclaimed. \"I mean that _I_ must seem a\npretty uninteresting bit of elderly shoe-leather.\" \"Uninteresting? Oh no!\" she cried in protest, and then checked herself\nand her colour rose a little. He smiled humorously. \"I can't see you out of this glass eye unless I turn round, so whether\nyou're pulling my leg or not I don't know, but I was just saying to old\nSimon that the only kind of lady likely to take an interest in me was a\nfemale collector of antique curiosities, and you don't seem that sort,\nMiss Farmond.\" She said nothing for a moment, and then asked:\n\n\"Were you discussing ladies then with Mr. Rattar?\" He also paused for a moment before replying. \"Incidentally in the course of a gossip, as the old chap hadn't got my\nbusiness ready for me. By the way, did you get much change out of him?\" She shook her head a little mournfully. \"Nothing at all. He just asked questions instead of answering them.\" \"So he did with me! Confound the man. I fancy he has made too much money\nand is beginning to take it easy. That's one advantage of not being too\nrich, Miss Farmond; it keeps you from waxing fat.\" \"I'm not likely to wax fat then!\" she laughed, and yet it was not quite\na cheerful laugh. He turned quickly and looked at her sympathetically. \"That your trouble?\" he enquired in his outspoken way. Cicely was not by way of giving her confidences easily, but this\nstraight-forward, friendly attack penetrated her reserve. \"It makes one so dependent,\" she said, her voice even lower than usual. \"That must be the devil,\" he admitted. \"It is!\" said she.

And then as he let the\nrecollections of their drive have their own way undisturbed, he began to\nsmile again, and kept smiling most of the way home. The road drew ever nearer to the sea, trees and hedgerows grew even\nrarer and more stunted, and then he was driving through a patch of\nplanting hardly higher than a shrubbery up to an ancient building on the\nvery brink of the cliffs. The sea crashed white below and stretched grey\nand cold to the horizon, the wind whistled round the battlements and\nsighed through the stunted trees, and Ned (who had been too absorbed to\nremember his coat) slapped his arms and stamped his feet as he descended\nbefore a nail-studded front door with a battered coat of arms above it. \"Lord, what a place!\" he said to himself, half critically, half\naffectionately. The old castle of Stanesland was but a small house as castles, or even\nmansions, go, almost devoid of architectural ornament and evidently\nbuilt in a sterner age simply for security, and but little embellished\nby the taste of more degenerate times. As a specimen of a small early\n15th Century castle it was excellent; as a home it was inconvenience\nincarnate. How so many draughts found their way through such thick walls\nwas a perennial mystery, and how to convey dishes from the kitchen to\nthe dining room without their getting cold an almost insoluble problem.

Until her youngest brother came into\nthe property, the place had been let and she had lived with her friends\nand relations. She had had a good time, she always frankly confessed,\nbut as frankly admitted that it was a relief to settle down at last. \"I was thinking,\" said her brother. \"About Cicely?\" she asked in her frankly audacious way. He opened his eyes for a moment and then laughed. \"You needn't guess again, Lilian,\" he admitted. \"Funny little thing,\" she observed. \"Funny?\" he repeated, and his tone brought an almost imperceptible\nchange of expression into his sister's eye. \"Oh,\" she said as though throwing the subject aside, \"she is nice and\nquite pretty, but very young, and not very sophisticated; is she?",

I don't imagine for an instant she'd look at\nme.\" \"Wouldn't look----!\" she began derisively, and then pulled herself up\nvery sharply, and altered her tactics on the instant. \"She might think\nyou a little too old for her,\" she said in a tone of entire agreement\nwith him. \"And also that I've got one too few eyes, and in fact several other\ncriticisms.\" His sister shrugged her shoulders. \"A girl of that age might think those things,\" she admitted, \"but it\nseems to me that the criticism ought to be on the other side. Who is\nshe?\" Ned looked at her and she broke into a laugh. \"Well,\" she said, \"I suppose we both have a pretty good idea. She's\nsomebody's something--Alfred Cromarty's, I believe; though of course\nher mother may have fibbed, for she doesn't look much like the\nCromartys. Anyhow that pretty well puts her out of the question.\" \"Why?\" \"If you were a mere nobody, it mightn't make so much difference, but\nyour wife must have some sort of a family behind her. One needn't be\na snob to think that one mother and a guess at the father is hardly\nenough!\" \"After all, that's up to me. I wouldn't be wanting to marry her\ngreat-mothers, even if she had any.\" She shrugged her shoulders again. \"My dear Ned, I'm no prude, but there's always some devilment in the\nblood in these cases.\" \"Rot!\" said he. \"Well, rot if you like, but I know more than one instance.\" He said nothing for a moment and as he sat in silence, a look of keen\nanxiety came into her eye. She hid it instantly and compressed her\nlips, and then abruptly her brother said:\n\n\"I wonder whether she's at all taken up with Malcolm Cromarty!\" She ceased to meet his eye, and her own became expressionless. \"They have spent some months in the same house. At their age the\nconsequences seem pretty inevitable.\" She had contrived to suggest a little more than she said, and he started\nin his chair. \"What do you know?\" he demanded. \"Oh, of course, there would be a dreadful row if anything was actually\nknown abroad. Sir Reginald has probably other ideas for his heir.\"",

VIII\n\nSIR REGINALD\n\n\nCicely Farmond and Malcolm Cromarty walked up the avenue together, he\npushing his bicycle, she walking by his side with a more than usually\nserious expression. \"Then you won't tell me where you've been?\" said he. \"You won't tell me where you've been!\" He was silent for a moment and then said confidentially:\n\n\"We might as well say we've been somewhere together. I mean, if any one\nasks.\" \"Thank you, I don't need to fib,\" said she. \"I don't mean I need to. Only----\" he seemed to find it difficult to\nexplain. \"I shall merely say I have been for a walk, and you need only say you\nhave been for a ride--if you don't want to say where you have really\nbeen.\" \"And if you don't want to mention that you were driving with Ned\nCromarty,\" he retorted. \"He only very kindly offered me a lift!\" She looked quickly at him as she spoke and as quickly away again. The\nglint in her eye seemed to displease him. \"You needn't always be so sharp with me, Cicely,\" he complained. \"You shouldn't say stupid things.\" Both were silent for a space and then in a low mournful voice he said:\n\n\"I wish I knew how to win your sympathy, Cicely. You don't absolutely\nhate me, do you?\" \"Of course I don't hate you. But the way to get a girl's sympathy is not\nalways to keep asking for it.\" He looked displeased again. \"I don't believe you know what I mean!\" \"I don't believe you do either.\" He grew tender. \"_Your_ sympathy, Cicely, would make all the difference to my life!\" \"Now, Malcolm----\" she began in a warning voice. \"Oh, I am not asking you to love me again,\" he assured her quickly. \"It\nis only sympathy I demand!\" \"But you mix them up so easily. It isn't safe to give you anything.\" \"I won't again!\" he assured her. \"Well,\" she said, though not very sympathetically, \"what do you want to\nbe sympathised with about now?\" \"When you offer me sympathy in that tone, I can't give you my\nconfidence!\" he said unhappily. \"Really, Malcolm, how can I possibly tell what your confidence is going\nto be beforehand? Perhaps it won't deserve sympathy.\" \"If you knew the state of my affairs!\" he said darkly. \"A few days ago you told me they were very promising,\" she said with a\nlittle smile. \"So they would be--so they are--if--if only you would care for me,\nCicely!\" \"You tell me they are promising when you want me to marry you, and\ndesperate when you want me to sympathise with you,\" she said a little\ncruelly. \"Which am I to believe?\" \"Hush!

If, however, the stranger chanced to provide the worthy\nbaronet with even the smallest opening of exhibiting his extraordinary\nkindness of heart--were it only by getting wet in a shower or mislaying\na walking stick, he would quickly comprehend. And the baronet's sympathy\nnever waited to be summoned; it seemed to hover constantly over all men\nand women he met, spying for its chance.

Indeed, few people in this world\ncan have cut a more dissimilar figure as seen from his own and from\nother men's eyes; though as both parties were equally pleased with Sir\nReginald Cromarty, it mattered little. At the sight of Cicely his smile revealed the warmth of his feelings in\nthat direction. \"Ah, my dear girl,\" said he, \"we've been looking for you. Where have you\nbeen?\" \"I've been having a walk.\" She smiled at him as she answered, and on his side it was easy to see\nthat the good gentleman was enraptured, and that Miss Farmond was not\nlikely to be severely cross-examined as to her movements. Towards\nMalcolm, on the other hand, though his greeting was kindly enough, his\neye was critical. The young author's tie seemed to be regarded with\nparticular displeasure. \"My God, Margaret, imagine being found dead in such a thing!\" he had\nexclaimed to his wife, after his first sight of it; and time had done\nnothing to diminish his distaste for this indication of a foreign way of\nlife. Lady Cromarty came out of the garden a moment later; a dark thin-faced\nlady with a gracious manner when she spoke, but with lips that were\nusually kept very tight shut and an eye that could easily be hard. \"Nearly time for lunch,\" she said. \"You two had better hurry up!\" The young people hurried on to the house and the baronet and his lady\nwalked slowly behind. \"So they have been away all morning together, Reginald,\" she remarked. \"Oh, I don't think so,\" said he. \"He had his bicycle and she has been\nwalking.\" \"You are really too unsuspicious, Reggie!\" \"A woman, my dear, is perhaps a little too much the reverse where a\nyoung couple is concerned. I have told you before, and I repeat it now\nemphatically, that neither Cicely nor Malcolm is in a position to\ncontemplate matrimony for an instant.\" \"He is your heir--and Cicely is quite aware of it.\" \"I assure you, Margaret,\" he said with great conviction, \"that Cicely is\nnot a girl with mercenary motives.",

Lunch had hardly begun before\na question from Cicely set him going, and for the rest of the meal he\nregaled her with these reminiscences. After luncheon he said to his wife:\n\n\"Upon my word, I noticed nothing whatever amiss.

The\nbilliard invitation was refused, and with a hidden smile Cicely followed\nhim to the bicycle house. Expert knowledge was James Bisset's foible. Of some subjects, such as\nbuttling, carpentry, and mending bicycles, it was practical; of others,\nsuch as shooting, gardening, and motoring, it was more theoretical. To\nSir Reginald and my lady he was quite indispensable, for he could repair\nalmost anything, knew his own more particular business from A to Z, and\nwas ready at any moment to shoulder any responsibility. Sir Reginald's\nkeeper, gardener, and chauffeur were apt however to be a trifle less\nenthusiastic, Mr. Bisset's passion for expounding the principles of\ntheir professions sometimes exceeding his tact. In person, he was an active, stoutly built man (though far too energetic\nto be fat), with blunt rounded features, eyes a little protruding, and\nsandy hair and a reddish complexion which made his age an unguessable\nsecret. He might have been in the thirties or he might have been in the\nfifties. \"With regard to these ladies' bicycles, miss--\" he began with a\nlecturer's air.

Luckily Mr. Cromarty of Stanesland gave me a lift\ncoming home.\" \"Oh, indeed, miss? Stanesland gave ye a lift, did he? An interesting\ngentleman yon.\" This time she made no effort to divert Mr. Bisset's train of thought. \"You think Mr. Cromarty interesting, then?\" said she. \"They say he's hanged a man with his ain hands,\" said Bisset\nimpressively. \"What!\" she cried. \"For good and sufficient reason, we'll hope, miss. But whatever the way\nof it, it makes a gentleman more interesting in a kin' of way than the\nusual run. And then looking at the thing on general principles, the\ntheory of hanging is----\"\n\n\"Oh, but surely,\" she interrupted, \"that isn't the only reason why Mr.\nCromarty--I mean why you think he is interesting?\" \"There's that glass eye, too. That's very interesting, miss.\" She still seemed unsatisfied. \"His glass eye! Oh--you mean it has a story?\" \"Vera possibly. He says himself it was done wi' a whisky bottle, but\npossibly that's making the best of it. But what interests me, miss,\nabout yon eye is this----\"\n\nHe paused dramatically and she enquired in an encouraging voice:\n\n\"Yes, Bisset?\" \"It's the principle of introducing a foreign substance so near the man's\nbrain.

Yet Sir Reginald\nseemed considerably disturbed. \"Damn the man!\" he exclaimed as he cast it on the breakfast table. \"Reggie!\" expostulated his wife gently. \"What's the matter?\" \"Matter?\" snapped her husband. \"Simon Rattar has the impudence to tell\nme he is letting the farm of Castleknowe to that fellow Shearer after\nall!\" \"But why not? You meant to some time ago, I know.\" \"Some time ago, certainly. But I had a long talk with Simon ten days ago\nand told him what I'd heard about Shearer and said I wouldn't have the\nfellow on my property at any price. I don't believe the man is solvent,\nin the first place; and in the second place he's a socialistic,\nquarrelsome, mischievous fellow!\" \"And what did Mr. Rattar think?\" \"He tried to make some allowances for the man, but in the end when he\nsaw I had made up my mind, he professed to agree with me and said he\nwould look out for another tenant. Now he tells me that the matter is\nsettled as per my instructions of the 8th. That's weeks ago, and not a\nword does he say about our conversation cancelling the whole\ninstructions!\" \"Then Shearer gets the farm?\" \"No, he doesn't! I'm dashed if he does!",

By Gad, I'm\ngoing to tell him a bit of my mind!\" During the rest of breakfast he glanced at the letter once or twice, and\neach time his brows contracted, but he said nothing more in presence of\nCicely and Malcolm. After he had left the dining room, however, Lady\nCromarty followed him and said:\n\n\"Don't be too hasty with Mr. Rattar, Reggie! After all, the talk may\nhave slipped his memory.\" \"Slipped his memory? If you had heard it, Margaret, you'd know better. I\nwas a bit cross with him for a minute or two then, which I hardly ever\nam, and that alone would make him remember it, one would think. We\ntalked for over an hour on the business and the upshot was clear and\nfinal. No, no, he has got a bit above himself and wants a touch of the\ncurb.\" \"What are you going to do?\" she asked. \"I'm going to send in a note by car and tell him to come out and see me\nabout the business at once.\" \"Let me see the letter before you send it, Reggie.\" He seemed to growl assent, but when she next saw him the letter had\ngone; and from the baronet's somewhat crusty explanation, she suspected\nthat it was a little sharper than he knew she would have approved. When the car returned his annoyance was increased again for a space. Mr.\nRattar had sent a brief reply that he was too busy to come out that\nafternoon, but he would call on Sir Reginald in the morning. For a time\nthis answer kept Sir Reginald in a state of renewed irritation, and then\nhis natural good humour began to prevail, till by dinner time he was\nquite calm again, and after dinner in as genial humour as he had been in\nthe day before. He played a game of pyramids with Cicely and Malcolm in the billiard\nroom, and then he and Cicely joined Lady Cromarty in the drawing room\nwhile the young author went up to his room to work, he declared. He had\na large bedroom furnished half as a sitting room where he retired each\nnight to compose his masterpieces as soon as it became impossible to\nenjoy Miss Farmond's company without having to share it in the drawing\nroom with his host and hostess. At least, that was the explanation of\nhis procedure given by Lady Cromarty, whose eye was never more critical\nthan when it studied her husband's kinsman and heir. Lady Cromarty's eye was not uncritical also of Cicely at times, but\nto-night she was so relieved to see how Sir Reginald's temper improved\nunder her smiles and half shy glances, that she let her stay up later\nthan usual. Then when she and the girl went up to bed, she asked her\nhusband if he would be late. \"The magazines came this morning,\" said he. \"I'd better sleep in my\ndressing room.\" The baronet was apt to sit up late when he had anything to read that\nheld his fancy, and the procedure of sleeping in his dressing room was\ncommonly followed then.",

When they came to Lady Cromarty's room, Cicely said good-night to her\nhostess and turned down the passage that led to her own bedroom. A door\nopened quietly as she passed and a voice whispered:\n\n\"Cicely!\" She stopped and regarded the young author with a reproving eye. \"Is anything the matter?\" she asked. \"I just wanted to speak to you!\" he pleaded. \"Now, Malcolm,\" she said severely, \"you know quite well that Lady\nCromarty trusts us _not_ to do this sort of thing!\" \"She's in her room, isn't she?\" \"What does that matter?\" \"And where's Sir Reginald?\" \"Still in the library.\" \"Sitting up late?\" \"Yes, but that doesn't matter either. Good night!\" \"Wait just one minute, Cicely! Come into my room--I won't shut the\ndoor!\" \"Certainly not!\" she said emphatically. \"Well then, don't speak so loudly!

XI\n\nNEWS\n\n\nEven in that scattered countryside of long distances by windy roads,\nwith scarcely ever a village as a focus for gossip, news flew fast. The\nnext morning Ned Cromarty had set out with his gun towards a certain\nsnipe marsh, but while he was still on the high road he met a man on a\nbicycle. The man had heard strange news and stopped to pass it on, and\nthe next moment Ned was hurrying as fast as his long legs could take him\nback to the castle. He saw his sister only for a moment. \"Lilian!\" he cried, and the sound of his voice made her start and stare\nat him. \"There's a story that Sir Reginald was murdered last night.\" \"Murdered!\" she repeated in a low incredulous voice. \"Ridiculous, Ned! Who told you?\" \"I only know the man by sight, but he seemed to believe it right\nenough.\" \"But how--who did it?\" Her brother shook his head. \"Don't know. He couldn't tell me. My God, I hope it's not true! I'm off\nto see.\" A few minutes later he was driving his mare headlong for his kinsman's\nhouse. It had begun to rain by this time, and the mournful wreaths of\nvapour that swept over the bare, late autumnal country and drove in fine\ndrops against his face sent his spirits down ever lower as the mare\nsplashed her way along the empty miles of road. The melancholy thrumming\nof the telegraph wires droned by his side all the while, and as this\ndirge waxed for the moment as they passed each post, his eye would\nglance grimly at those gaunt poles. Very suitable and handy for a\ncertain purpose, they struck him--if by any possibility this tale were\ntrue.",

What does it mean? Do you mean to say it's actually\n_true_?\" Bisset shook his head sombrely. \"Ower true,\" said he. \"But as to how it happened, come in to the\nlibrary, sir. It was in his ain library he was killed! The Fiscal and\nSuperintendent is there now and we've been going into the circumstantial\nevidence. Most extraordinary mystery, sir--most extraordinary!\" In the library they found Simon Rattar and Superintendent Sutherland. The Superintendent was a big burly red-moustached man; his face a\ncertificate of honesty, but hardly of the intellectual type. Ned looked\nround him apprehensively for something else, but Bisset said:\n\n\"We've taken him upstairs, sir.\" For a moment as he looked round that spacious comfortable room with its\nlong bookcases and easy chairs, and on the tables and mantel-piece a\nhundred little mementoes of its late owner, the laird of Stanesland was\nunable to speak a word, and the others respected his silence. Then he\npulled himself together sharply and asked:\n\n\"How did it happen? Tell me all about it!\" Perhaps there might have been for a moment in Simon's eye a hint that\nthis demand was irregular, but the superintendent evidently took no\nexception to the intrusion. Besides being a considerable local magnate\nand a kinsman of the dead baronet, Stanesland had a forcible personality\nthat stood no gainsaying. \"Well, sir,\" said the superintendent, \"Mr. Rattar could perhaps explain\nbest----\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, Sutherland,\" said Simon briefly. The superintendent pointed to a spot on the carpet a few paces from the\ndoor. \"We found Sir Reginald lying there,\" he said. \"His skull had been fairly\ncracked, just over the right eye, sir. The blow would have been enough\nto kill him I'd think myself, but there were marks in his neck too,\nseeming to show that the murderer had strangled him afterwards to make\nsure. However, we'll be having the medical evidence soon. But there's no\ndoubt that was the way of it, and Mr. Rattar agrees with me.\" The lawyer merely nodded. \"What was it done with?\" The superintendent pursed his lips and shook his head. \"That's one of the mysterious things in the case, sir. There's no sign\nof any weapon in the room. The fire irons are far too light. But it was\nan unco' heavy blow. There was little bleeding, but the skull was fair\ncracked.\" \"Was anything stolen?\" \"That's another mystery, sir. Nothing was stolen anywhere in the house\nand there was no papers in a mess like, or anything.\" \"When was he found?\" asked Ned. \"Seven-fifty this morning, sir,\" said Bisset. \"The housemaid finding the\ndoor lockit came to me. I knew the dining-room key fitted this door too,\nso I opened it--and there he lay.\" \"All night, without any one knowing he hadn't gone to bed?\" \"That's the unfortunate thing, sir,\" said the superintendent. \"It seems\nthat Sir Reginald had arranged to sleep in his dressing room as he was\ngoing to be sitting up late reading.\" \"Murderer must have known that,\" put in Simon.",

They turned towards him, but it seemed that he was talking to himself. He was, in fact, quietly taking measurements with a tape. \"Go on,\" said Cromarty briefly. \"Well, sir,\" said the superintendent. \"The body was found near the door\nas I was pointing out, but it's a funny thing that a small table had\nbeen upset apparently, and Bisset tells us that that table stood near\nthe window.\" \"Humph,\" grunted Simon sceptically. \"I'm quite sure of it, Mr. Rattar,\" said Bisset confidently, looking\nround from his work of measurement. \"No positive proof it was upset,\" said the lawyer. \"Did you find it upset?\" asked Ned. The lawyer shook his head emphatically and significantly, and the\nsuperintendent agreed. \"No, it was standing just where it is now near the wall.\" \"Then why do you think it was upset?\" \"I picked up yon bits of sealing wax and yon piece of India rubber,\"\nsaid Bisset, looking round again. \"I know they were on the wee table\nyesterday and I found them under the curtain in the morning and the\ntable moved over to the wall. It follows that the table has been cowpit\nand then set up again in another place, and the other things on it put\nback. Is that not a fair deduction, sir?\" Ned nodded thoughtfully. \"Seems to me so,\" he said. \"It seems likely enough,\" the superintendent also agreed. \"And if that's\nthe case there would seem to have been some kind of ongoings near the\nwindow.\" The Procurator Fiscal still seemed unconvinced. \"Nothing to go on. No proper evidence. It leads nowhere definitely,\" he\nsaid. \"Well now,\" continued the superintendent, \"the question is--how did the\nmurderer get into the room? The door was found locked and the key had\nbeen taken away, so whether he had locked it from the inside or the\noutside we can't tell. There's small chance of finding the key, I doubt,\nfor a key's a thing easy hidden away.\" \"So he might have come in by the door and then left by the door and\nlocked it after him,\" said Ned. \"Or he might have come in by the window,\nlocked the door and gone out by the window. Or he might have come in by\nthe window and gone out by the door, locking it after him. Those are all\nthe chances, aren't they?\" \"Indeed, that seems to be them all,\" said the superintendent with a note\nof admiration for this clear exposition that seemed to indicate he was\nbetter himself at details than deductions. \"And now what about the window? Was that open or shut or what?\" \"Shut but not snibbed, sir.\" Ned turned to Bisset. \"Did Sir Reginald ever forget to snib the windows, supposing one\nhappened to be open?\" \"Practically never, sir.\" \"Last thing before he left the room, I suppose?\" said the lawyer. The butler hesitated. \"I suppose so, sir,\" he admitted, \"but of course I was never here to\nsee.\" \"Exactly!\" said Simon.",

But were\nthe windows fastened before Sir Reginald came in to sit here last\nthing?\" \"Certainly they were that,\" said the butler emphatically. \"It was a mild night, he might have opened one himself,\" replied the\nProcurator Fiscal. \"Or supposing the man had come in and left again by\nthe door, what's more likely than that he unsnibbed the window to make\npeople think he had come that way?\" \"He would surely have left it wide open,\" objected Ned. \"Might have thought that too obvious,\" replied the lawyer, \"or might\nhave been afraid of the noise. Unsnibbing would be quite enough to\nsuggest entry that way.\" Ned turned his keen eye hard on him. \"What's your own theory then?\" \"I've none,\" grunted Simon. \"No definite evidence one way or the other. Mere guesses are no use.\" Ned walked to the window and looked at it carefully. Then he threw it up\nand looked out into the garden. \"Of course you've looked for footsteps underneath?\" he asked. \"Naturally,\" said Simon. \"But it's a hard gravel path and grass beyond. One could fancy one saw traces, but no definite evidence.\" The window was one of three together, with stone mullions between. They\nwere long windows reaching down nearly to the level of the floor, so\nthat entrance that way was extremely easy if one of them were open. Cromarty got out and stood on the sill examining the middle sash. Simon regarded him with a curious caustic look for a moment in his eye. \"Looking for finger marks?\" he enquired. \"Yes,\" said Ned. \"Did you look for them?\" For a single instant the Procurator Fiscal seemed a little taken aback. Then he grunted with a half laugh:\n\n\"Don't believe much in them.\" \"Experienced criminals, that's been convicted before, frequently wears\ngloves for to prevent their finger prints being spotted,\" said the\nlearned Bisset. Mr. Rattar shot him a quick ambiguous glance, and then his eyes assumed\ntheir ordinary cold look and he said:\n\n\"No evidence anybody ever opened that window from the outside. If they\nhad, Sir Reginald would have heard them.\" \"Well,\" said Ned, getting back into the room, \"there are no finger marks\nanyhow.\" \"The body being found near the door certainly seems to be in favour of\nMr. Rattar's opinion,\" observed the superintendent. \"I thought Mr. Rattar had formed no opinion yet,\" said Cromarty. \"No more I have,\" grunted the lawyer.

It was clear he felt that the\nmanagement of the household was in his hands now. \"I am sure Miss Farmond would be pleased, sir--poor young lady!\" \"Do you really think so?\" said Ned, and his manner brightened visibly. \"Well, if she won't mind----\"\n\n\"I think if you come this way, sir, you will find her with Sir Malcolm.\"",

He was led towards the billiard room, an addition to the house which lay\nrather apart. The door was half open and through it he could see that\nthe blinds had been drawn down, and he could hear a murmur of voices. \"They are in there, sir,\" said Bisset, and he left him. As Ned Cromarty entered he caught the words, spoken by the new baronet:\n\n\"My dear Cicely, I depend on your sympathy----\"\n\nHe broke off as he heard a footstep, and seemed to move a little apart\nfrom the chair where Cicely was sitting. The two young people greeted their visitor, Cicely in a voice so low\nthat it was scarcely audible, but with a smile that seemed, he thought,\nto welcome him; Sir Malcolm with a tragic solemnity which no doubt was\nquite appropriate to a bereaved baronet. The appearance of a third party\nseemed, however, to afford him no particular gratification, and after\nexchanging a sentence or two, he begged, in a very serious tone, to be\nexcused, and retired, walking softly and mournfully. Ned noticed then\nthat his face was extraordinarily pale and his eye disturbed. \"I was afraid of disturbing you,\" said Ned. He was embarrassed, a rare\ncondition with him, which, when it did afflict him, resulted in an\nimpression of intimidating truculence. Cicely seemed to shrink a little, and he resolved to leave instantly. \"Oh no!\" she said shyly. \"I only wanted to say that if I could do anything for you--well, you've\nonly to let me know.\" \"It's awfully kind of you,\" she murmured. There was something so evidently sincere in this murmur that his\nembarrassment forthwith left him. \"Thank Heaven!\" he said after his outspoken habit. \"I was afraid I was\nputting my foot in it. But if you really don't mind my seeing you for a\nminute or two, I'd just like to say----\"\n\nHe broke off abruptly, and she looked up at him questioningly. \"Dash it, I can't say it, Miss Farmond! But you know, don't you?\" She murmured something again, and though he could not quite hear what it\nwas, he knew she understood and appreciated. Leaning against the corner of the shrouded billiard table, with the\nblinds down and this pale slip of a girl in deep mourning sitting in a\nbasket chair in the dim light, he began suddenly to realise the tragedy. \"I've been too stunned till now to grasp what's happened,\" he said in a\nmoment. \"Our best friend gone, Miss Farmond!\" He had said exactly the right thing now. \"He certainly was mine!\" she said. \"And mine too. We may live to be a brace of Methuselahs, but I guess\nwe'll never see his like again!\" His odd phrase made her smile for a moment despite herself. It passed\nswiftly and she said:\n\n\"_I_ can't believe it yet.\" Again there was silence, and then he said abruptly:\n\n\"It's little wonder you can't believe it. The thing is so extraordinary.

B is where the corp was found. You follow that,\nsir?\" Ned nodded. \"I follow,\" said he. \"Now, the principle in a' these cases of crime and detection,\" resumed\nthe philosopher, assuming his lecturer's air, \"is noticing such sma'\npoints of detail as escape the eye of the ordinar' observer, taking full\nand accurate measurements, making a plan with the principal sites\ncarefully markit, and drawing, as it were, logical conclusions. Applying\nthis method now to the present instance, Mr. Cromarty, the first point\nto observe is that the room is twenty-six feet long, measured from the\nwindie, which is a bit recessed or set back, as it were, to the other\nend of the apartment. Half of 26 is 13, and if you take the half way\nline and draw approximate perpendiculars to about where the table was\nstanding and to as near as one can remember where the middle of the corp\nroughly was lying, you get exactly six feet ten and five-eighths inches,\nin both cases.\" \"An approximate perpendicular to roughly about these places gives this\nexact measurement?\" repeated Cromarty gravely. \"Well, what next?\" \"Well, sir, I'll not insist too much on the coincidence, but it seems to\nme vera remarkable. But the two significant features of this case seem\nto me yon table being upset over by the windie and the corp being found\nover by the door.\" \"You're talking horse sense now,\" murmured Ned. \"Now, yon table was upset by Sir Reginald falling on it!\" Ned looked at him keenly. \"How do you know?\" \"Because one of the legs was broken clean off!\" \"What, when we saw it this morning?\" \"We had none of us noticed it then, sir; but I've had a look at it\nsince, and there's one leg broken fair off at the top. The break was\nhalf in the socket, as it were, leaving a kind of spike, and if you\nstick that into the socket you can make the table look as good as new. It's all right, in fac', until you try to move it, and then of course\nthe leg just drops out.\" \"And it wasn't like that yesterday?\" \"I happened to move it myself not so long before Sir Reginald came into\nthe room, and that's how I know for certain where it was standing and\nthat it wasn't broken. And yon wee light tables dinna lose their legs\njust with being cowped, supposing there was nothing else than that to\nsmash them. No, sir, it was poor Sir Reginald falling on top of it that\nsmashed yon leg.\" \"Then he was certainly struck down near the window!\" \"Well, we'll see that in a minute. It's no in reason, Mr. Cromarty, to\nsuppose he deliberately opened the windie to let his ain murderer in. And it's a' just stuff and nonsense to suggest Sir Reginald was sitting\non a winter's night--or next door to winter onyhow, with his windie wide\nopen.

Till he arrived at his own door, the laird of Stanesland was unconscious\nof a single incident of his drive home. All the way his eye stared\nstraight into space. Sometimes a gleam would light it for an instant,\nand then he would shake his head and the gleam would fade away. \"I can see neither a damned head nor a damned tail to it!\" he said to\nhimself as he alighted. XIV\n\nTHE QUESTION OF MOTIVE\n\n\nTwo days later Mr. Ison entered Mr. Simon Rattar's room and informed him\nthat Mr. Cromarty of Stanesland wished to see him on particular\nbusiness. The lawyer was busy and this interruption seemed for the\nmoment distinctly unwelcome. Then he grunted:\n\n\"Show him in.\" In the minute or two that passed before the laird's entrance, Simon\nseemed to be thinking intently and finally to come to a decision, which,\nto judge from his reception of his client, was on rather different lines\nfrom his first thoughts when Mr. Cromarty's name was announced. To\ndescribe Simon Rattar at any time as genial would be an exaggeration,\nbut he showed his nearest approach to geniality as he bade his client\ngood-morning. \"Sorry to interrupt you,\" said Ned, \"but I can't get this business out\nof my head, night or day. Whether you want me or not, I've got to play a\nhand in this game; but it's on your side, Mr. Rattar, and maybe I might\nbe able to help a little if I could get something to go on.\" The lawyer nodded. \"I quite understand. Glad to have your help, Mr. Cromarty. Dreadful\naffair. We're all trying to get to the bottom of it, I can assure you.\" \"I believe you,\" said Ned. \"There never was a man better worth avenging\nthan Sir Reginald.\" \"Quite so,\" said Simon briefly, his eyes fixed on the other's face. \"Any fresh facts?\" Simon drew a sheet of paper from his desk. \"Superintendent Sutherland has given me a note of three--for what they\nare worth, discovered by the butler. The first is about that table. It\nseems a leg has been broken.\" \"Bisset told me that before I left the house.\" \"And thought it was an important fact, I suppose?\" \"What its importance is, it's hard to say, but it's a fact, and seems to\nme well worth noting.\" \"It is noted,\" said the Procurator Fiscal drily. \"But I can't see that\nit leads anywhere.\" \"Bisset maintains it implies Sir Reginald fell over it when he was\nstruck down; and that seems to me pretty likely.\" Simon shook his head. \"How do we know Sir Reginald hadn't broken it himself previously and\nthen set it up against the wall--assuming it ever stood anywhere else,\nwhich seems to want confirmation?\" \"A dashed thin suggestion!\" said Ned. \"However, what are the other\ndiscoveries?\" \"The second is that one or two small fragments of dried mud were found\nunder the edge of the curtain, and the third is that the hearth brush\nwas placed in an unusual position--according to Bisset.\" \"And what are Bisset's conclusions?\"",

The only people that gained anything,\nMr. Cromarty, are those who will benefit under Sir Reginald's will.\" Cromarty's expression did not change again. This was evidently the new\npoint of view. Simon opened a drawer and took from it a document. \"In the ordinary course of events Sir Reginald's will would not be known\ntill after his funeral to-morrow, but if I may regard this conversation\nas confidential, I can tell you the principal facts so far as they\naffect this case.\" \"I don't want you to do anything you shouldn't,\" said Ned quickly. \"If\nit's not the proper game to read the will now, don't.\" But Silent Simon seemed determined to oblige this morning.",

And also, what was that motive?\" \"Is that the whole list of them?\" Mr. Rattar glanced at the will again. \"Sir Reginald has cancelled your own debt of twelve hundred pounds, Mr. Cromarty.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Ned, and for a moment could say no more.

I hadn't the foggiest notion Sir\nReginald meant to cancel that debt!\" \"You may not have known,\" said Simon still very drily, \"and it is quite\npossible that Bisset may not have known of his legacy. Though, on the\nother hand, it is likely enough that Sir Reginald mentioned the fact\nthat he would be remembered. But Lady Cromarty presumably knew his\narrangements. And it is most unlikely that he should have said nothing\nto his heir about his intention to make him an adequate allowance if he\ncame into the title and Lady Cromarty was still alive and life rented in\nthe place. Also, it is highly probable that either Sir Reginald or Lady\nCromarty told Miss Farmond that some provision would be made for her.\" Ned Cromarty said nothing for a few moments, but he seemed to be\nthinking very hard. Then he rose from his chair and remarked:\n\n\"Well, I guess this has all got to be thought over.\" He moved slowly to the door, while Simon gazed silently into space. His\nhand was on the handle when the lawyer turned in his chair and asked:\n\n\"Why was nothing said about Sir Malcolm's engagement to Miss Farmond?\" \"Well,\" said Ned, \"the whole thing is no business of mine, but Sir\nReginald had pretty big ideas in some ways and probably one of them was\nconnected with his heir's marriage.\" \"A clandestine engagement then?\" Ned Cromarty seemed to dislike the term. \"It's none of my business,\" he said shortly. \"There was no blame on\nanyone, anyhow; and mind you, this is absolutely confidential.\" The door closed behind him and Simon was left still apparently thinking. XV\n\nTWO WOMEN\n\n\nOn the day after the funeral Lady Cromarty for the first time felt able\nto see the family lawyer. Simon Rattar came out in the morning in a\nhired car and spent more than a couple of hours with her. Then for a\nshort time he was closeted with Sir Malcolm, who, referring to the\ninterview afterwards, described him as \"infernally close and\nunsatisfactory\"; and finally, in company with the young baronet and\nCicely Farmond, he ate a hurried lunch and departed. Ever since the fatal evening, Lady Cromarty had been shut up in her own\napartments and the two young people had taken their meals together. Sir\nMalcolm at his brightest and best had been capricious company. He was\nnow moody beyond all Cicely's experience of him. His newborn solemnity\nwas the most marked feature of his demeanour, but sometimes it dissolved\ninto pathetic demands for sympathy, and then again froze into profound\nand lugubrious silence. He said that he was sleeping badly, and the\npallor of his face and the darkness beneath his eyes seemed to confirm\nthis. Several times he appeared to be on the point of some peculiarly\nsolemn disclosure of his feelings or his symptoms, but always ended by\nupbraiding his fellow guest for her lack of sympathy, and then relapsing\ninto silence. Every now and then on such occasions Cicely caught him staring at her\nwith an expression she had never seen before, and then looking hurriedly\naway; a disconcerting habit that made her own lot none the easier.",

At lunch her air\nwas a little livelier at first, as if even Simon Rattar were a welcome\nvariety in a r\u00e9gime of undiluted baronet. Sir Malcolm, too, endeavoured\nto do the honours with some degree of cheerfulness; but short though the\nmeal was, both were silent before the end and vaguely depressed\nafterwards. \"I can't stand the old fellow's fishy eye!\" declared Sir Malcolm. \"I'd\nas soon lunch with a cod-fish, dash it! Didn't you feel it too, Cicely?\" \"He seemed to look at one so uncomfortably,\" she agreed. \"I couldn't\nhelp feeling he had something on his mind against me, though I suppose\nhe really doesn't trouble his head about my existence.\" \"I'm hanged if I like the way he looks at me!\" muttered the baronet, and\nonce again Cicely caught that odd expression in his eye. That afternoon Bisset informed Miss Farmond that her ladyship desired to\nsee her. Lady Cromarty's face looked thinner than ever and her lips more\ntightly compressed. In her deep mourning and with her grave air, she\nseemed to Cicely a monumental figure of tragedy. Her thinness and pallor\nand tight lips, she thought only natural, but there was one note that\nseemed discordant with pure desolation. The note was sounded by Lady\nCromarty's eyes. At all times they had been ready to harden upon an\noccasion, but Cicely thought she had never seen them as hard as they\nwere now. \"What are your plans, Cicely?\" she asked in a low, even voice that\nshowed no feeling one way or the other. \"I have begun to pack already,\" said the girl. \"I don't want to leave so\nlong as I can be of any use here, but I am ready to go at any time.\" She had expected to be asked where she was going, but Lady Cromarty\ninstead of putting any question, looked at her for a few moments in\nsilence. And it was then that a curious uncomfortable feeling began to\npossess the girl. It had no definite form and was founded on no reason,\nbeyond the steady regard of those hard dark eyes. \"I had rather you stayed.\" Cicely's own eyes showed her extreme surprise. \"Stayed--here?\" \"Yes.\" \"But are you sure? Wouldn't you really rather be alone? It isn't for my\nsake, is it? because--\"\n\n\"It is for mine. I want you to remain here and keep me company.\" She spoke without a trace of smile or any softening of her face, and\nCicely still hesitated. \"But would it really be convenient? You have been very kind to me, and\nif you really want me here--\"\n\n\"I do,\" interrupted Lady Cromarty in the same even voice.",

Perhaps you will excuse me now, Cicely.\" The girl went downstairs very thoughtfully. At the foot the young\nbaronet met her. \"Have you settled where to go?\" he asked. \"Lady Cromarty has asked me to stay on with her.\" His face fell. \"Stay on in this house of mourning? Oh, no, Cicely!\" \"I have promised,\" she said. The young man grew curiously agitated. \"Oh, don't stay here!\" he besought her. \"It keeps me in such dreadful\nsuspense!\" \"In suspense!\" she exclaimed. \"Whatever do you mean, Malcolm?\" Again she saw that look in his eye, and again he raised a\nsympathy-beseeching wail. Cicely's patience began to give way. \"Really, Malcolm!\" she cried tartly, \"if you have anything to say, say\nit, but don't go on like a baby!\" \"Like a baby!\" repeated the deeply affronted baronet. \"Heavens, would\nyou liken me to _that_, of all things! I had meant to confide in you,\nCicely, but you have made it impossible. Impossible!\" he repeated\nsombrely, and stalked to the door. Next morning, Sir Malcolm left for London, his confidence still locked\nin his breast, and Cicely was alone with Lady Cromarty. XVI\n\nRUMOUR\n\n\nOne windy afternoon a man on a bicycle struggled up to the door of\nStanesland Castle and while waiting for an answer to his ring, studied\nthe front of that ancient building with an expression which would at\nonce have informed his intimates that he was meditating on the\nprinciples of Scottish baronial architecture. A few minutes later Mr.\nBisset was shown into the laird of Stanesland's smoking room and\naddressed Mr. Cromarty with a happy blend of consciousness of his own\nimportance and respect for the laird's. \"I have taken the liberty of calling, sir, for to lay before you a few\nfresh datas.\" \"Fire away,\" said the laird. \"In the first place, sir, I understand that you have been making\nenquiries through the county yourself, sir; is that not so?\" \"I've been through this blessed county, Bisset, from end to end to see\nwhether I could get on the track of any suspicious stranger. I've been\nworking both with the police and independent of the police, and I've\ndrawn blank.\" Bisset looked distinctly disappointed. \"I've heard, sir, one or two stories which I was hoping might have\nsomething in them.\" \"I've heard about half a dozen and gone into them all, and there's\nnothing in one of them.\" \"Half a dozen stories?\" Bisset's eye began to look hopeful again. \"Well,\nsir, perhaps if I was to go into some of them again in the light of my\nfresh datas, they might wear, as it were, a different aspect.\" \"Well,\" said Ned. \"What have you found? Have a cigar and let's hear what\nyou've been at.\" The expert crackled the cigar approvingly between his fingers, lit it\nwith increased approval, and began:\n\n\"Yon man was behind the curtains all the time.\" \"The devil he was! How do you know?\" \"Well, sir, it's a matter of deduction.",

But such minor points we can consider in a\nwee while, when we have seen how everything is otherwise explained. Now\nsupposing we have the murderer behind the curtains; that brings him\nwithin six feet of where the wee table was standing. How did he get Sir\nReginald to come to the table? He made some kind of sound. What kind of\nsound? Some imitation of an animal; probably of a cat. How did Sir\nReginald not cry out when he saw the man? Because he never did see the\nman! How did he not see him?\" \"Man was a ventriloquist and made a sound in the other direction,\"\nsuggested Ned with extreme gravity. \"God, but that's possible, Mr. Cromarty! I hadna thought of that!

He was from the Colonies or America or one of\nthae wild places! Is that not a fair deduction, sir?\" \"It all points to that,\" said Ned, with a curious look. \"It points to that indeed, sir.

Then he said\nmiserably:\n\n\"So it's no good, and all the alternatives just fa' to pieces.\" The extreme dejection of his voice struck the other sharply. \"Alternatives to what?\" he asked. For a few seconds Bisset did not answer. \"What's on your mind, man?\" demanded Cromarty. \"The reason, sir, I've got that badly off the rails with my deductions\nis just that I _had_ to find some other theory than the story that's\ngoing about.\" \"What story?\" \"You've no heard it, sir?\" Ned shook his head. \"I hardly like to repeat it, sir; it's that cruel and untrue.",

There was a crack now as his teeth\nwent through the mouthpiece. He flung the pipe into the fire, jumped up,\nand began pacing the room without a word or a glance at the other. At\nlast he stopped as abruptly as he had started. \"This slander has got to be stopped!\" And then he paced on. \"Just what I was saying to myself, sir.

Simon pushed aside\nthe papers and looked at him fixedly. \"Oh,\" he said. \"They say that, do they?\" \"Haven't you heard?\" Simon's grunt was non-committal. \"Well anyway, this derned story is going about, and something's got to\nbe done to stop it.\" \"What do you suggest?\" \"Are you still working the case for all you know how?\" Simon seemed to resent this enquiry a little. \"I am the Procurator Fiscal. The police make the actual enquiries. They\nhave done everything they could.\" \"'They have done'? Do you mean that they have stopped looking for the\nmurderer?\" \"Certainly not. They are still enquiring; not that it is likely to be\nmuch further use.\" There seemed to be a sardonic note in his last words that deepened\nCromarty's frown and kindled his eye. \"You mean to suggest that any conclusion has been reached?\" \"Nothing is absolutely certain,\" said Simon. Again the accent on the \"absolutely\" seemed to rouse his visitor's ire. \"You believe this story, do you?\" \"If I _believed_ it, I should order an arrest. I have just told you\nnothing is absolutely certain.\" \"Look here,\" said Cromarty, \"I don't want to crab Superintendent\nSutherland or his men, but you want to get somebody better than them on\nto this job.\" Though the Procurator Fiscal kept his feelings well in hand, it was\nevident that this suggestion struck him more unfavourably than anything\nhis visitor had said yet.

He\nshook his head emphatically, but his voice was as dispassionately\nbrusque as ever. \"London detective? Much over-rated people, I assure you. No use in a\ncase of this kind.\" \"The very kind of case a real copper-bottomed expert would be some use\nin!\" \"You are thinking of detectives in stories, Mr. Cromarty.

And until I get\nmore evidence, I am not only justified but forced to take this course.\" Ned suddenly jumped to his feet. \"I'm no lawyer,\" said he, \"but to me you seem to be arguing in the\ndamnedest circle I ever met. You won't do anything because you can't\nget more evidence. And you won't look for more evidence because you\ndon't want to do anything.\" There was more than a hint of temper in Simon's eye and his answer was\nrapped out sharply. \"I certainly do not _want_ to cause a family scandal. I haven't said all\nI could say about Sir Malcolm if I were pressed.\" \"Why not?\" \"I've told you. Suspicion is not evidence, but if I do get evidence,\nthose who will suffer by it had better beware!\" Ned turned at the door and surveyed him with a cool and caustic eye. \"That's talk,\" he said, \"and something has got to be _done_.\" He was gone, and Simon Rattar was left frowning at the closed door\nbehind him. The frown remained, but became now rather thoughtful than\nindignant. Then he sprang up and began to pace the floor, deliberately\nat first, and then more rapidly and with increasing agitation. XVIII\n\n\u00a31200\n\n\nNed Cromarty had returned home and was going upstairs, when he heard a\nvoice cry:\n\n\"Ned!\" The ancient stone stair, spiralling up round the time-worn pillar that\nseemed to have no beginning or end, gave at intervals on to doors which\nlooked like apertures in a cliff. Through one of these he turned and at\nthe end of a brief passage came to his sister's sitting room. In that\nmedi\u00e6val setting of ponderous stone, it looked almost fantastic in its\ndaintiness. It was a small room of many cushions and many colours, its\nfloor covered with the softest rugs and its walls with innumerable\nphotographs, largely of country houses where Miss Cromarty had visited. Evidently she was a lady accustomed to a comfortable life in her roving\ndays, and her sitting room seemed to indicate very distinctly that she\nproposed to live up to this high standard permanently. \"Oh Neddy dear, I want to talk to you about something,\" she began in her\nbrisk way and with her brightest smile. Her brother, though of a simple nature, was by this time aware that when\nhe was termed \"Neddy dear\" the conversation was apt to turn on Miss\nCromarty's requirements. \"Well,\" said he, \"how much is the cheque to be this time?\" \"How clever you're getting!\" she laughed. \"But it isn't a cheque I want\nthis time. It's only a motor car.\" He looked at her doubtfully for a moment. \"Pulling my leg; or a real car?\" \"Real car of course--nice one too!\" \"But, my dear girl, we've just put down our car. You agreed it was\nnecessary.\" \"I agreed then; but it isn't necessary now.\"",

Now you haven't. See, Neddy dear?\" Her brother began to shake his head, and her smile became a little less\nbright. \"I don't want to get my affairs into a tangle again just yet.\" \"But they weren't in a bad tangle. Cancelling that debt makes us\nabsolutely all right again. It's absurd for people like us not to have a\ncar! Look at the distances from our neighbours! One can't go anywhere. I'll undertake to keep down the household expenses if you get the car.\" Her brother frowned out of the window. \"No,\" he said, \"it's too soon to get a car again.\" \"But you told me you had got part of that \u00a31200 in hand and hoped to\nmake up the rest very soon. What are you going to do with the money\nnow?\" He glanced at her over his shoulder for an instant and then his mouth\nassumed a grim and obstinate look she knew too well. \"I may need the money,\" he said briefly. \"And I'm not much in the mood\nat this moment for buying things.\" Behind his back Lilian made a little grimace.

His sister looked a little surprised at his unusual shortness of temper. To her he was very rarely like this. \"You need a good day's shooting to take your mind off it for a little,\"\nshe suggested. He turned upon her hotly. \"Do you know the story that's going about, Lilian?\" \"Sir Malcolm and the Farmond girl? Oh, rather,\" she nodded. \"Is that how it strikes you?\" Lilian Cromarty jumped.

But how do\nI know whether it's a slander?\" \"You actually think it might conceivably be true?\" She shrugged her well-gowned shoulders. \"I never could stand Malcolm Cromarty--a conceited little jackanapes. He\nhasn't a penny and he was head over ears in debt.\" It was his turn to start. \"Was he?\" \"Oh, rather! Didn't you know? Owed money everywhere.\" \"But such a crime as that!\" \"A man with ties and hair like his is capable of anything. You know\nquite well yourself he is a rotter.\" \"Anyhow you can't believe Cicely Farmond had anything to do with it?\" Again she shrugged her shoulders. \"My dear Ned, I'm not a detective.

XIX\n\nTHE EMPTY COMPARTMENT\n\n\nIt was on this same evening that Superintendent Sutherland was almost\nrewarded for his vigilance by having something distinctly suspicious to\nreport. As it happened, it proved a disappointing incident, but it gave\nthe superintendent something to think about. He was going a few stations down the line to investigate a rumour of a\nsuspicious person seen in that neighbourhood. It was a vague and\nimprobable rumour and the superintendent was setting out merely as a\nmatter of form, and to demonstrate his vigilance and almost abnormal\nsense of duty. Darkness had already fallen for an hour or two when he\nstrode with dignified gait down the platform, exchanging a greeting with\nan acquaintance or two, till he came to the front carriage of the train. He threw open the door of the rear compartment, saw that it was empty,\nand was just going to enter when glancing over his shoulder he perceived\nhis own cousin Mr. MacAlister upon the platform. Closing the door, he\nstepped down again and greeted him. Mr. MacAlister hailed him with even more than usual friendliness, and\nafter a few polite preliminaries drew him insidiously towards the far\nside of the platform. An intelligent, inveterate and persevering\ncuriosity was Mr. MacAlister's dominating characteristic, and as soon as\nhe had got his distinguished kinsman out of earshot of the herd, he\ninquired in a hushed voice:\n\n\"And what's doing aboot the murder noo, George?\" The superintendent pursed his lips and shook his head. \"Aye, man, yon's a proper puzzle,\" said he. \"But you'll have gotten a guid idea whae's din it by noo, George?\" said\nMr. MacAlister persuasively. \"Weel,\" admitted the superintendent, \"we maybe have our notions, but\nthere's no evidence yet, Robbie; that's the fair truth. As the fiscal\nsays, there's no evidence.\" \"I'd like fine to hae a crack wi' you aboot it, George,\" sighed Mr.\nMacAlister. \"I may tell you I've notions of ma own; no bad notions\neither.\" \"Well,\" said the superintendent, moving off, \"I'd have enjoyed a crack\nmyself if it wasna that I've got to be off by this train--\"\n\n\"Man!\" cried his kinsman, \"I'm for off by her mysel'! Come on, we'll hae\nour crack yet.\" The tickets had already been taken and the doors were closed as the two\nrecrossed the platform. \"This carriage is empty,\" said the superintendent, and threw open the\ndoor of the same compartment he had almost entered before. But it was not empty now. In one of the further corners sat a man\nwrapped in a dark coloured ulster. A black felt hat was drawn down over\nhis eyes, and his muffled face was resting on his hand.",

And then his cousin caught him by the arm and drew him back. \"Here, man, the carriage next door is empty!\" cried he, and the\nsuperintendent closed the door and followed him. It was scarcely more than a minute later when the whistle blew and they\nwere off, and Mr. MacAlister took out his pipe and prepared himself to\nreceive official confidences. But the miles went by, and though he plied\nhis questions incessantly and skilfully, no confidences were\nforthcoming. The superintendent, in fact, had something else to think\nabout. All at once he asked abruptly:\n\n\"Robbie, did ye see yon man next door sitting with his face in his\nhands?\" \"Aye,\" said Mr. MacAlister, \"I noticed the man.\" \"Did ye ken who he was?\" \"No,\" said Mr. MacAlister, \"I did not.\" \"Had ye seen him on the platform?\" \"No,\" said Mr. MacAlister, \"I had not.\" \"I didna see him myself,\" said the superintendent musingly. \"It seems\nfunny-like a man dressed like yon and with his face wrapped up too--and\na man forbye that's a stranger to us both, coming along the platform\nand getting into that carriage, and me not noticing him. I'm not used\nnot to notice people, Robbie.\" \"It's your business, George,\" said Mr. MacAlister, and then as he gazed\nat his cousin's thoughtful face, his own grew suddenly animated. \"You're not thinking he's to dae wi' the murder, are you!\" he cried. \"I'm not sure what to think till I've had another look into yon\ncarriage,\" said the superintendent cautiously. \"We're slowing doon the noo!\" cried Mr. MacAlister, \"God, George, I'll\ncome and hae a look wi' you!\" The train was hardly in the platform before the superintendent was out,\nwith Mr. MacAlister after him, and the door of the next compartment\nwas open almost as soon as the train was at rest. Never had the\nsuperintendent been more vigilant; and never had his honest face\nlooked blanker. \"God! It's empty!\" he murmured. \"God save us!\" murmured Mr. MacAlister, and then he was visited by an\ninspiration which struck his relative afterwards as one of the\nunhappiest he had ever suffered from. \"This canna be the richt\ncarriage!\" he cried. \"Come on, Geordie, let's hae a look in the ithers!\" By the time they had looked into all the compartments of the carriage,\nthe guard was waving his flag and the two men climbed hurriedly in\nagain. The brooding silence of the superintendent infected even Mr.\nMacAlister, and neither spoke for several minutes. Then the\nsuperintendent said bitterly:\n\n\"It was you hurrying me off to look in thae other carriages, Robbie!\" \"What was?\" inquired Mr. MacAlister a little nervously. \"I ought to have stopped and looked under the seats!\" Mr. MacAlister shook his head and declared firmly:\n\n\"There was naething under the seats. I could see that fine. And onyhow\nwe can hae a look at the next stop.\"",

Here were we sitting next the platform. He can't have got out afore we started, or we'd have seen him. Folks\ndon't disappear into the air! I'll try under the seats, though I doubt\nthe man will have been up and out while we were wasting our time in yon\nother carriages.\" At the next station they searched that mysterious compartment earnestly\nand thoroughly, but there was not a sign of the muffled stranger, under\nthe seats or anywhere else. Again the superintendent was silent for a\nspace, and then he said confidentially:\n\n\"I'm just wondering if it's worth while reporting the thing, Robbie. The\nfiscal might have a kin' of unpleasant way of looking at it. Besides,\nthere's really naething to report. Anyhow I'll think it over. And that\nbeing the case, the less said the better. I can tell ye all that's known\nabout the case, Robbie; knowing that you'll be discreet.\" \"Oh, you can trust me,\" said Mr. MacAlister earnestly,--\"I'll no breathe\na word o' yon man. Weel, now, you were saying you'd tell me the haill\nstory.\" By this judicious arrangement Mr. MacAlister got his money's worth of\nsensational disclosures, and the superintendent was able to use his\ndiscretion and think the incident over. He thought over it very hard and\nfinally decided that he was demonstrating his vigilance quite\nsufficiently without mentioning the trifling mystery of the empty\ncompartment. XX\n\nTHE SPORTING VISITOR\n\n\nIn summer and autumn, visitors were not uncommon in this remote\ncountryside; mostly shooting or fishing people who rented the country\nhouses, raised the local prices, and were described by the tradesmen as\nbenefiting the county greatly. But in late autumn and winter this\nfertilising stream ceased to flow, and when the trains from the south\ncrawled in, the porters and the boots from the hotels resigned\nthemselves to welcoming a merely commercial form of traveller. It was therefore with considerable pleasure and surprise that they\nobserved one afternoon an unmistakeably sporting gentleman descend from\na first class compartment and survey them with a condescending yet\naffable eye. \"Which is the best of these hotels?\" he demanded with an amiable smile,\nas he surveyed through a single eyeglass the names on the caps of the\nvarious boots. His engaging air disarmed the enquiry of embarrassment, and even when he\nfinally selected the Kings Arms Hotel, the other boots merely felt\nregret that they had not secured so promising a client. His luggage\nconfirmed the first favourable impression. It included a gun case, a\nbag of golf clubs, and one or two handsome leather articles. Evidently\nhe meant to make more than a passing visit, and as he strolled down the\nplatform, his leisurely nonchalant air and something even in the way in\nwhich he smoked his cigarette in its amber holder, suggested a gentleman\nwho, having arrived here, was in no hurry to move on. On a luggage label\nthe approving boots noted the name of \"F. T. Carrington.\" When he arrived at the Kings Arms, Mr. Carrington continued to produce\nfavourable impressions.",

He was so polite and so\ngood-humoured and so ready to be pleased with everything he saw and\nanything she suggested, that they became firm friends within ten minutes\nof his arrival, and after Mr. Carrington had disposed of his luggage in\nthe bedroom and private sitting room which he engaged, and partaken of a\nlittle dinner, she found herself welcoming him into her own sitting room\nwhere a few choice spirits nightly congregated. It is true that these spirits, though choice, were hardly of what she\ncalled Mr. Carrington's \"class,\" but then in all her experience she had\nnever met a gentleman of such fashion and such a superior air, who\nadapted himself so charmingly to any society. In fact, \"charming\" was\nthe very adjective for him, she decided. About his own business he was perfectly frank. He had heard of the\nsporting possibilities of the county and had come to look out for a bit\nof fishing or shooting; preferably fishing, for it seemed he was an\nenthusiastic angler. Of course, it was too late in the season for any\nfishing this year, but he was looking ahead as he preferred to see\nthings for himself instead of trusting to an agent's description. He had\nbrought his gun just on the chance of getting a day somewhere, and his\nclub in case there happened to be a golf links. In short, he seemed\nevidently to be a young man of means who lived for sport; and what other\nquestion could one ask about such a satisfactory type of visitor? Absolutely none, in Miss Peterkin's opinion. As a matter of fact, she found very early in the evening, and continued\nto find thereafter, that the most engaging feature of Mr. Carrington's\ncharacter was the interest he took in other people's business, so that\nthe conversation very quickly strayed away from his own concerns--and\nremained away. It was not that he showed any undue curiosity; far from\nit. He was simply so sympathetic and such a good listener and put\nquestions that showed he was following everything you said to him in a\nway that really very few people did. And, moreover, in spite of his\nengaging frankness, there was an indefinable air of discretion about him\nthat made one feel safe to tell him practically everything. She herself\ntold him the sad story of her brother in Australia (a tale which, as a\nrule, she told only to her special intimates) before he had been in her\nroom half an hour.",

Mr. Carrington's surprise was extreme when he realised\nthat he was actually in the county where the tragedy had occurred,\nwithin a very few miles of the actual spot, in fact. Of course, he had\nread about it in the papers, but only cursorily, it seemed, and he had\nno idea he was coming into the identical district that had acquired such\na sinister notoriety. \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed more than once when he had made this discovery,\n\"I say, how interesting!\" \"Oh,\" said Miss Peterkin with becoming pride, \"we are getting quite\nfamous, I can assure you, Mr. Carrington.\" \"Rather so!\" cried he, \"I've read quite a lot about this Carnegie\ncase----\"\n\n\"Cromarty,\" corrected one of the spirits. \"Cromarty, of course, I mean! I'm rather an ass at names, I'm afraid.\" The young man smiled brightly and all the spirits sympathised. \"Oh yes,\nI've seen it reported in the papers. And now to think here I am in the\nmiddle of it, by George! How awfully interesting! I say, Miss Peterkin,\nwhat about these gentlemen having another wee droppie with me, all\nround, just to celebrate the occasion?\" With such an appreciative and hospitable audience, Miss Peterkin and the\nchoice spirits spent a long and delightful evening in retailing every\nknown circumstance of the drama, and several that were certainly unknown\nto the authorities. He was vastly interested, though naturally very\nshocked, to hear who was commonly suspected of the crime. \"Do you mean to say his own heir--and a young girl like that----? By\nJove, I say, how dreadful!\" he exclaimed, and, in fact, he would hardly\nbelieve such a thing conceivable until all the choice spirits in turn\nhad assured him that there was practically no doubt about it. The energetic part played by Mr. Simon Rattar in unravelling the dark\nskein, or at least in trying to, was naturally described at some length,\nand Mr. Carrington showed his usual sympathetic, and, one might almost\nsay, entranced appreciation of the many facts told him concerning that\nlocal celebrity. Finally Miss Peterkin insisted on getting out the back numbers of the\nlocal paper giving the full details of the case, and with many thanks he\ntook these off to read before he went to bed. \"But mind you don't give yourself the creeps and keep yourself from\ngoing to sleep, Mr. Carrington!\" she warned him with the last words. \"By Jove, that's an awful thought!\" he exclaimed, and then his eyes\ntwinkled. \"Send me up another whisky and soda to cure the creeps!\" said\nhe. Miss Peterkin thought he was quite one of the pleasantest, and promised\nto be one of the most profitable gentlemen she had met for a very long\ntime. Next morning he assured her he had kept the creeps at bay sufficiently\nto enjoy an excellent night's sleep in a bed that did the management\ncredit. In fact, he had thoroughly enjoyed reading the mystery and had\neven begun to feel some curiosity to see the scene of the tragedy.",

Miss Peterkin told him which road led to Keldale and how the house might\nbe recognised, and suggested that he should walk out that way this very\nmorning. He seemed a little doubtful; spoke of his movements as things\nthat depended very much on the whim of the moment, just as such an\neasy-going young man would be apt to do, and rather indicated that a\nshorter walk would suit him better that morning. And then a few minutes later she saw him saunter past her window,\nwearing a light gray felt hat at a graceful angle and apparently taking\na sympathetic interest in a small boy trying to mount a bicycle. XXI\n\nMR. CARRINGTON'S WALK\n\n\nMr. Carrington's easy saunter lasted till he had turned out of the\nstreet on which the Kings Arms stood, when it passed into an easy walk. Though he had seemed, on the whole, disinclined to go in the Keldale\ndirection that morning, nevertheless he continued to head that way till\nat last he was on the high road with the little town behind him; and\nthen his pace altered again. He stepped out now like the sportsman he\nwas, and was doing a good four miles an hour by the time he was out of\nsight of the last houses. For a man who had come out to gather ideas as to the sporting\npossibilities of the country, Mr. Carrington seemed to pay singularly\nlittle attention to his surroundings. He appeared, in fact, to be\nthinking about something else all the time, and the first sign of\ninterest he showed in anything outside his thoughts was when he found\nhimself within sight of the lodge gates of Keldale House, with the\navenue sweeping away from the road towards the roofs and chimneys amid\nthe trees. At the sight of this he stopped, and leaning over the low\nwall at the road side gazed with much interest at the scene of the\ntragedy he had heard so much of last night. The choice spirits, had\nthey been there to see, would have been gratified to find that their\ngraphic narratives had sent this indolent looking gentleman to view the\nspot so swiftly. From the house and grounds his eye travelled back to the road and then\nsurveyed the surrounding country very attentively. He even stood on top\nof the wall to get a wider view; and then all of a sudden he jumped down\nagain and adopted the reverse procedure, bending now so that little more\nthan his head appeared above the wall. And the reason for this change of\nplan appeared to be a figure which had emerged from the trees and began\nto move along a path between the fields. Mr. Carrington studied this figure with concentrated attention, and as\nit drew nearer and became more distinct, a light leapt into his eye that\ngave him a somewhat different expression from any his acquaintances of\nlast night had observed. He saw that the path followed a small stream\nand ran at an angle to the high road, joining it at last at a point some\nlittle distance back towards the town. He looked quickly up and down the\nroad. Not a soul was in sight to see his next very curious performance.",

And then he turned down the path. But now his bearing altered again in a very extraordinary way. His gait\nfell once more to a saunter and his angling enthusiasm seemed suddenly\nto have returned, for he frequently studied the burn as he strolled\nalong, and there was no sign of any thoughtfulness on his ingenuous\ncountenance. There were a few willows beside the path, and the path\nitself meandered, and this was doubtless the reason why he appeared\nentirely unconscious of the approach of another foot passenger till they\nwere within a few yards of one another. And then Mr. Carrington stopped\nsuddenly, seemed to hesitate, pulled out his watch and glanced at it,\nand then with an apologetic air raised his hat. The other foot passenger was face to face with him now, a slim figure in\nblack, with a sweet, serious face. \"Excuse me,\" said Mr. Carrington, \"but can you tell me where this path\nleads?\" He was so polite and so evidently anxious to give no offence, and his\nface was such a certificate to his amiable character that the girl\nstopped too and answered without hesitation:\n\n\"It leads to Keldale House.\" \"Keldale House?\" he repeated, and then the idea seemed to arouse\nassociations. \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed. \"Really? I'm an utter stranger\nhere, but isn't that the place where the murder took place?\" Had Mr. Carrington been a really observant man, one would think he would\nhave noticed the sudden change of expression in the girl's face--as if\nhe had aroused painful thoughts. He did seem to look at her for an\ninstant as he asked the question, but then turned his gaze towards the\ndistant glimpse of the house. \"Yes,\" she murmured and looked as though she wanted to pass on; but Mr.\nCarrington seemed so excited by his discovery that he never noticed this\nand still stood right in her path. \"How very interesting!\" he murmured. \"By Jove, how very interesting!\" And then with the air of passing on a still more interesting piece of\nnews, he said suddenly, \"I hear they have arrested Sir Malcolm\nCromarty.\" This time he kept his monocle full on her. \"Arrested him!\" she cried. \"What for?\" This question, put with the most palpable wonder, seemed to disconcert\nMr. Carrington considerably. He even hesitated in a very unusual way for\nhim. \"For--for the murder, of course.\" Her eyes opened very wide. \"For Sir Reginald's murder? How ridiculous!\" Again Mr. Carrington seemed a little disconcerted. \"Er--why is it ridiculous?\" he asked. \"Of course, I--I know nothing\nabout the gentleman.\" \"Evidently!\" she agreed with reproach in her eyes. \"If Sir Malcolm\nreally has been arrested, it can only have been for something quite\nsilly. He couldn't commit a murder!\" The fact that this tribute to the baronet's innocence was not wholly\ndevoid of a flavour of criticism seemed to strike Mr. Carrington, for\nhis eye twinkled for an instant. \"You are acquainted with him then?\" said he. \"I am staying at Keldale; in fact, I am a relation.\"",

I beg your pardon!\" he exclaimed. \"I had no idea. Really, I hope\nyou will accept my apologies, Miss--er--Cromarty.\" \"Miss Farmond,\" she corrected. \"Miss Farmond, I mean. It was frightfully tactless of me!\" He said it so nicely and looked so innocently guilty and so contrite,\nthat her look lost its touch of indignation. \"I still can't understand what you mean about Sir Malcolm being\narrested,\" she said. \"How did you hear?\" \"Oh, I was very likely misinformed. An old fellow at the hotel last\nnight was saying so.\" Her eye began to grow indignant again. \"What old fellow?\" \"Red hair, shaky knees, bit of a stammer, answers to the name of Sandy,\nI believe.\" \"Old Sandy Donaldson!\" she exclaimed. \"That drunken old thing! He was\nsimply talking nonsense as usual!\" \"He seemed a little in liquor,\" he admitted, \"but you see I am a mere\nstranger. I didn't realise what a loose authority I quoted. There is\nnothing in the report, I am certain. And this path leads only to Keldale\nHouse? Thank you very much. Good morning!\" How Mr. Carrington had obtained this erroneous information from a person\nwhose back he had merely seen for a couple of minutes the night before,\nas the reprobate in question was being ejected from the Kings Arms, he\ndid not stop to explain. In fact, at this point he showed no inclination\nto continue the conversation, but bowing very politely, continued his\nstroll. But the effect of the conversation on him remained, and a very marked\neffect it appeared to be. He took no interest in the burn any longer,\nbut paced slowly on, his eyes sometimes on the path and sometimes\nstaring upwards at the Heavens. So far as his face revealed his\nsensations, they seemed to be compounded of surprise and perplexity. Several times he shook his head as though some very baffling point had\ncropped up in his thoughts, and once he murmured:\n\n\"I'm damned!\" When the path reached the policies of the house, he stopped and seemed\nto take some interest in his surroundings once more. For a moment it was\nclear that he was tempted to enter the plantations, and then he shook\nhis head and turned back. All the way home he remained immersed in thought and only recovered his\nnonchalant air as he entered the door of the Kings Arms. He was the same\neasy-going, smiling young man of fashion as he passed the time of day\nwith Miss Peterkin; but when he had shut the door of his private sitting\nroom and dropped into an easy chair over the fire, he again became so\nabsorbed in thought that he had to be reminded that the hour of luncheon\nhad passed. Thought seemed to vanish during lunch, but when he had retired to his\nroom again, it returned for another half hour. At the end of that time\nhe apparently came to a decision, and jumping up briskly, repaired to\nthe manageress' room. And when Miss Peterkin was taken into his\nconfidence, it appeared that the whole problem had merely concerned the\nquestion of taking either a shooting or a fishing for next season.",

I gather that he is agent for several estates in the county. What do you\nadvise?\" Miss Peterkin decidedly advised this course, so a few minutes later Mr.\nCarrington strolled off towards the lawyer's office. XXII\n\nMR. CARRINGTON AND THE FISCAL\n\n\nThe card handed in to Mr. Simon Rattar contained merely the name \"Mr. F.\nT. Carrington\" and the address \"Sports Club.\" Simon gazed at it\ncautiously and in silence for the better part of a minute, and when he\nglanced up at his head clerk to tell him that Mr. Carrington might be\nadmitted, Mr. Ison was struck by the curious glint in his eye. It seemed\nto him to indicate that the fiscal was very wide awake at that moment;\nit struck him also that Mr. Rattar was not altogether surprised by the\nappearance of this visitor. The agreeable stranger began by explaining very frankly that he thought\nof renting a place for next season where he could secure good fishing\nand a little shooting, and wondered if any of the properties Mr. Rattar\nwas agent for would suit him. Simon grunted and waited for this overture\nto develop. \"What about Keldale House?\" the sporting visitor suggested. \"That's the\nplace where the murder was committed, isn't it?\" and then he laughed. \"Your eye betrays you, Mr. Rattar!\" said he. The lawyer seemed to start ever so slightly. \"Indeed?\" he murmured. \"Look here,\" said Carrington with a candid smile, \"let's put our cards\non the table. You know my business?\" \"Are you a detective?\" asked the lawyer. Mr. Carrington smiled and nodded. \"I am; or rather I prefer to call myself a private enquiry agent. People\nexpect so much of a detective, don't they?\" Simon grunted, but made no other comment. \"In a case like this,\" continued Carrington, \"when one is called in\nweeks too late and the household broom and scrubbing brush and garden\nrake have removed most of the possible clues, and witnesses'\nrecollections have developed into picturesque legends, it is better to\nrouse as few expectations as possible, since it is probably impossible\nto find anything out. However, in the capacity of a mere enquiry agent I\nhave come to pick up anything I can. May I smoke?\" He asked in his usual easy-going voice and with his usual candid smile,\nand then his eye was arrested by an inscription printed in capital\nletters, and hung in a handsome frame upon the office wall. It ran:\n\n                    \"MY THREE RULES OF LIFE,\n\n               \"1. I DO NOT SMOKE. 2. I LAY BY A THIRD OF MY INCOME. 3. I NEVER RIDE WHEN I CAN WALK.\" Beneath these precepts appeared the lithographed signature of an eminent\nphilanthropist, but it seemed reasonable to assume that they also formed\nthe guiding maxims of Mr. Simon Rattar. His visitor politely apologised for his question. \"I had not noticed this warning,\" said he. \"Smoke if you like. My clients sometimes do. I don't myself,\" said the\nlawyer. His visitor thanked him, placed a cigarette in his amber holder, lit it,\nand let his eyes follow the smoke upwards.",

He made no further comment at all now, but waited\nin silence for his visitor to proceed. \"Well,\" resumed Carrington, \"the simple facts of the case are these. I\nhave been engaged through a certain firm of London lawyers, whose name I\nam not permitted to mention, on behalf of a person whose name I don't\nknow.\" At this a flash of keen interest showed for an instant in Simon's eye;\nand then it became as cold as ever again. \"Indeed?\" said he. \"I am allowed to incur expense,\" continued the other, \"up to a certain\nfigure, which is so handsome that it gives me practically a free hand,\nso far as that is concerned. On the other hand, the arrangement entails\ncertain difficulties which I daresay you, Mr. Rattar, as a lawyer, and\nespecially as a Procurator Fiscal accustomed to investigate cases of\ncrime, will readily understand.\" \"Quite so; quite so,\" agreed Mr. Rattar, who seemed to be distinctly\nrelaxing already from his guarded attitude. \"I arrived last night, put up at the Kings Arms--where I gathered\nbeforehand that the local gossip could best be collected, and in the\ncourse of the evening I collected enough to hang at least two people;\nand in the course of a few more evenings I shall probably have enough to\nhang half a dozen--if one can believe, say, a twentieth of what one\nhears. This morning I strolled out to Keldale House and had a look at it\nfrom the road, and I learned that it was a large mansion standing among\ntrees. That's all I have been able to do so far.\" \"Nothing more than that?\" Mr. Carrington seemed to have a singularly short memory. \"I think that's the lot,\" said he. \"And what is more, it seems to me the\nsum total of all I am likely to do without a little assistance from\nsomebody in possession of rather more authentic facts than my friend\nMiss Peterkin and her visitors.\" \"I quite understand,\" said the lawyer; and it was plain that his\ninterest was now thoroughly enlisted. \"Well,\" continued Mr. Carrington, \"I thought things over, and rightly or\nwrongly, I came to this decision. My employer, whoever he is, has made\nit an absolute condition that his name is not to be known. His reasons\nmay have been the best imaginable, but it obviously made it impossible\nfor me to get any information out of _him_. For my own reasons I always\nprefer to make my enquiries in these cases in the guise of an\nunsuspected outsider, whenever it is possible; and it happens to be\nparticularly possible in this case, since nobody here knows me from\nAdam. But I must get facts--as distinguished from the Kings Arms'\ngossip, and how was I to get them without giving myself away? That was\nthe problem, and I soon realised that it was insoluble. I saw I must\nconfide in somebody, and so I came to the decision to confide in you.\" Simon nodded and made a sound that seemed to indicate distinctly his\nopinion that Mr. Carrington had come to a sensible decision. \"You were the obvious person for several reasons,\" resumed Carrington.",

And in the\nthird place, I gather that you are--if I may say so, a gentleman of\nunusual discretion.\" Again he smiled pleasantly, and again Mr. Rattar's features relaxed. \"Finally,\" added Carrington, \"I thought it long odds that you were\neither actually my employer or acting for him, and therefore I should\nbe giving nothing away by telling you my business.

I won't give you away if you won't give\nme.\" The lawyer's nod seemed to imply emphatic assent, and the other went on:\n\n\"I'll keep you informed of everything I'm doing and anything I may\nhappen to discover, and you can give me very valuable information as to\nwhat precisely is known already. Otherwise, of course, one could hardly\nexchange confidences so freely. Frankly then, you engaged me to come\ndown here?\" Even then Simon's caution seemed to linger for an instant.

And I admit that it is a\npossibility.\" \"Ah!\" said Carrington. \"I heard about him last night, but so far\nsuspicion certainly hasn't fastened on him. What sort of a fellow is\nhe?\" \"He has lived the greater part of his life in the wilder parts of\nAmerica--rather what one might call a rough and ready customer.\" It was apparent that Mr. Carrington, for all his easy-going air, was\nextremely interested. \"This is quite interesting!\" he murmured. \"To what extent did he benefit\nby the will?\" \"\u00a31,200.\" \"\u00a31,200!\" Carrington repeated the words with an odd intonation and\nstared very hard at the lawyer. There was no doubt that his interest was\nhighly excited now, and yet it seemed to be rather a different quality\nof interest this time. \"A considerable sum,\" said Simon. \"That is the only point about it which strikes you?\" Simon was manifestly puzzled. \"What else?\" he enquired. \"No coincidence occurs to you?\" The lawyer's puzzled look remained, and the next instant Carrington\nbroke into a hearty laugh. \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Rattar,\" he cried. \"What an owl I am! I have\njust been dealing lately with a case where that sum of money was\ninvolved, and for the moment I mixed the two up together!\" He laughed\nagain, and then resuming his businesslike air, asked: \"Now, what else\nabout this Mr. Cromarty? You say he is a relation. Near or distant?\" \"Oh, quite distant. Another branch altogether.\" \"Younger branch, I presume.\" \"Poorer but not younger. He is said to be the head of the family.\" \"Really!\" exclaimed Mr. Carrington, and this information seemed to have\nset him thinking again. \"He is the head of the family, and I hear he\ntook up the case with some energy.\" Simon's grunt seemed to be critical. \"He got in our way,\" he said. \"Got in your way, did he?\" Carrington was silent for a few moments, and then said:\n\n\"Well I am afraid I have taken up a great deal of your time. May I have\na line of introduction to Mr. Bisset before I go?\" While the line was being written he walked over to the fire and cleared\nthe stump of his last cigarette out of the holder. This operation was\nvery deliberately performed, and through it his eyes seemed scarcely to\nnote what his hands were doing. He put the note in his pocket, shook hands, and then, just as he was\ngoing, he said:\n\n\"I want to understand the lie of the land as exactly as possible. Your\nown attitude, so far has been, I take it--no proof, therefore no arrest;\nbut a nasty family scandal left festering, so you decided to call me in. Now, I want to know this--is there anybody else in the neighbourhood who\nknows that I have been sent for?\" Mr. Rattar replied with even more than his usual deliberation, and after\nwhat is said by foreigners to be the national habit, his reply\nconsisted of another question.",

I am asking now whether there\nis any other employer in this neighbourhood besides yourself. And I may\nsay that I ask for the very good reason that it might be awkward for me\nif there were and I didn't know him, while if I did know him, I could\nconsult with him if it happened to be advisable. Is there any one?\" He seemed to hang on the lawyer's answer, and Simon to dislike making\nthe answer. Yet when he did make it, it was quite emphatic. \"No,\" he replied. \"That's all right then,\" said Mr. Carrington with his brightest smile. \"Good afternoon, Mr. Rattar.\" The smile faded from his ingenuous face the moment the door had closed\nbehind him, and it was a very thoughtful Mr. Carrington who slowly went\ndownstairs and strolled along the pavement. If his morning's interview\nhad puzzled him, his afternoon's interview seemed to have baffled him\ncompletely. He even forgot to relapse into the thoughtless young\nsportsman when he entered the hotel, and his friend the manageress,\nafter eyeing him with great surprise, cried archly:\n\n\"A penny for your thoughts, Mr. Carrington! About shooting or fishing,\nI'm sure!\" Mr. Carrington recovered his pleasant spirits instantly. \"Quite right,\" said he. \"I was thinking about fishing--in very deep\nwaters.\" XXIV\n\nMR. BISSET'S ASSISTANT\n\n\nAt eleven o'clock next morning a motor car drove up to Keldale House and\nan exceedingly affable and pleasing stranger delivered a note from Mr.\nSimon Rattar to Mr. James Bisset. Even without an introduction, Mr.\nCarrington would have been welcome, for though Mr. Bisset's sway over\nKeldale House was by this time almost despotic, he had begun to find\nthat despotism has its lonely side, and to miss \"the gentry.\" With an\nintroduction, Mr. Carrington quickly discovered that Mr. Bisset and the\nmansion he supervised were alike entirely at his disposal. The preliminary discussion on the sporting possibilities of the estate\nand the probability of its being let next season impressed Mr. Bisset\nvery favourably indeed with his visitor; and then when the conversation\nhad passed very naturally to the late tragedy in the house, he was still\nfurther delighted to find that Mr. Carrington not only shared his own\ndetective enthusiasm, but was vastly interested in his views on this\nparticular mystery. \"Come along here, sir,\" said he, \"we can just have a look at the\nlibrary and I'll explain to you the principles of the thing.\" \"I'd like to see the actual scene of the crime immensely!\" cried Mr.\nCarrington eagerly. \"You are sure that Lady Cromarty won't object?\" \"Not her,\" said Bisset. \"She's never in this part of the house now. She'll be none the wiser anyhow.\" This argument seemed to assure Mr. Carrington completely, and they went\nalong to the library. \"Now,\" began Bisset, \"I'll just explain to you the haill situation. Here\nwhere I'm laying this sofie cushion was the corp. Here where I'm\nstanding the now was the wee table, and yon's the table itself.\"",

Bisset had by this time evolved quite a number of new\ntheories, but the one feature common to them all was the hypothesis that\nthe murderer must have come in by the window and was certainly not an\ninmate of the household. His visitor said little till he had finished,\nand then he remarked:\n\n\"Well, Bisset, you don't seem to put much faith in the current theory, I\nsee.\" \"Meaning that Sir Malcolm and Miss Farmond were concerned?\" said Bisset\nindignantly. \"That's just the ignorance of the uneducated masses, sir! The thing's physically impossible, as I've just been demonstrating!\" Carrington smiled and gently shook his head. \"I don't know much about these things,\" said he, \"but I'm afraid I can't\nsee the physical impossibility. It was very easy for any one in the\nhouse to come downstairs and open that door, and if Sir Reginald knew\nhim, it would account for his silence and the absence of any kind of a\nstruggle.\" \"But yon table and the windie being unfastened! And the mud I picked up\nmyself--and the hearth brush!\" \"They scarcely make it impossible,\" said Carrington. \"Well, sir,\" demanded the butler, \"what's your own theory?\" Carrington said nothing for several minutes. He strolled up and down the\nroom, looked at the table and the window, and at last asked:\n\n\"Do you remember quite distinctly what Sir Reginald looked like when you\nfound him--the position of the body--condition of the clothes--and\neverything else?\" \"I see him lying there every night o' my life, just as plain as I see\nyou now!\" \"The feet were towards the door, just as though he had been facing the\ndoor when he was struck down?\" \"Aye, but then my view is the body was moved----\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a curious performance on Mr. Carrington's part. His visitor was in fact stretching himself out on the floor on the spot\nwhere Sir Reginald was found. \"He lay like this?\" he asked. \"Aye, practically just like that, sir.\" \"Now, Bisset,\" said the recumbent visitor, \"just have a very good look\nat me and tell me if you notice any difference between me and the body\nof Sir Reginald.\" Bisset looked for a few seconds and then exclaimed:\n\n\"Your clothes are no alike! The master's coat was kind of pulled up like\nabout his shoulders and neck. Oh, and I mind now the tag at the back for\nhanging it up was broken and sticking out.\" Carrington sprang to his feet with a gleam in his eye. \"The tag was not broken before he put on the coat?\" \"It certainly was not that! But what's your deduction, sir?\" Carrington smiled at him. \"What do you think yourself, Bisset? You saw how I threw myself down\nquite carelessly and yet my coat wasn't pulled up like that.\" \"God, sir!\" cried the butler. \"You mean the corp had been pulled along\nthe floor by the shoulders!\" Carrington nodded. \"Then he had been killed near the windie!\" \"Not too fast, not too fast!\" smiled Carrington. \"Your own first\nstatement which I happened to read in a back number of the newspaper\nthe other day said that the windows were all fastened when Sir Reginald\ncame into the room.\"",

Why need the man have been a stranger at all?\" Bisset's face fell. \"But surely you're not believing yon story that it was Sir Malcolm and\nMiss Farmond after a'?\" His visitor stood absolutely silent for a full minute. Then he seemed\nsuddenly to banish the line of thought he was following. \"Is it quite certain that those two are engaged?\" he asked. Bisset's face showed his surprise at the question. \"They all say so,\" said he. \"Have either of them admitted it?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Why don't they acknowledge it now and get married?\" \"They say it's because they daurna for fear of the scandal.\" \"'They' say again!\" commented Carrington. \"But, look here, Bisset, you\nhave been in the house all the time. Did you think they were engaged?\" \"Honestly, sir, I did not. There's nae doubt Sir Malcolm was sweet on\nthe young lady, but deil a sign of sweetness on him did I ever see in\nher!\" \"Do they correspond now?\" Bisset shook his head. \"Hardly at a'. But of course folks just say they are feared to now.\" \"Has anybody asked either of them if they are--or ever were--engaged?\" \"No, sir. But if they denied it now, folks would just say the same\nthing.\" \"Yes. I see--naturally. Lady Cromarty believes it and is keeping Miss\nFarmond under her eye, the gossips tell me. Is that so?\" \"Oh, that's true right enough, sir.\" \"Who told Lady Cromarty?\" \"That I do not know, sir.\" Again the visitor seemed to be thinking, and again to cast his thoughts\naside and take up a new aspect of the case. \"Supposing,\" he suggested, \"we were to draw the curtains and light these\ncandles for a few minutes? It might help us to realise the whole\nthing.\" This suggestion pleased Mr. Bisset greatly and in a minute or two the\ncandles were lit and the curtains drawn. \"Put the table where it stood,\" said Carrington. \"Now which was Sir\nReginald's chair? This?\" He sat in it and looked slowly round the darkened, candle-lit library. \"Now,\" said he, \"suppose I was Sir Reginald, and there came a tap at\nthat window, what would I do?\" \"If you were the master, sir, you'd go straight to the windie to see who\nit was.\" \"I wouldn't get in a funk and ring the bell?\" \"No fears!\" said Bisset confidently. \"And any one who knew Sir Reginald at all well could count on his not\ngiving the alarm then if they tapped at the window?\" \"They could that.\" Carrington looked attentively towards the window. \"Those curtains hang close against the window, I see,\" he observed.",

My, the\ndeductions to be drawn! You've made it quite clear now, sir.

Without that, the window theory remains a guess. Sir Malcolm is in\nLondon, I understand?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Likely to be coming north soon?\" \"No word of it, sir.\" Mr. Carrington reflected for a moment and then rose and went towards the\nwindow. \"We can draw back the curtains now,\" said he. He drew them as he spoke and on the instant stepped involuntarily back\nand down went the small table. Miss Cicely Farmond was standing just\noutside, evidently arrested by the drawn curtains. Her eyes opened very\nwide indeed at the sight of Mr. Carrington suddenly revealed. Her lips\nparted for an instant as though she would cry out, and then she hurried\naway. Mr. Carrington seemed more upset by this incident than one would expect\nfrom such a composed, easy-going young man. \"What will they think of me!\" he exclaimed. \"You must be sure to tell\nMiss Farmond--and Lady Cromarty too if she hears of this--that I came\nsolely to enquire about the shootings and not to poke my nose into their\nlibrary! Make that very explicit, Bisset.\" Even though assured by Bisset that the young lady was the most amiable\nperson imaginable, he was continuing to lay stress on the point when his\nattention was abruptly diverted by the sight of another lady in deep\nblack walking slowly away from the house. \"Is that Lady Cromarty?\" he asked, and no sooner had Bisset said \"yes\"\nthan the window was up and Mr. Carrington stepping out of it. \"I really must explain and apologise to her ladyship,\" said he. \"Her ladyship will never know----!\" began Bisset, but the surprising\nvisitor was already hastening after the mourning figure. Had the worthy\nman been able to hear the conversation which ensued he would have been\nmore surprised still. \"Lady Cromarty, I believe?\" said the stranger in a deferential voice. She turned quickly, and her eyes searched him with that hard glance they\nwore always nowadays. \"Yes, I am Lady Cromarty,\" she said. \"Pardon me for disturbing you,\" said he. \"It is a mere brief matter of\nbusiness. I represent an insurance company to which Sir Malcolm Cromarty\nhas made certain proposals. We are not perfectly satisfied with his\nstatements, and from other sources learn that he is engaged to be\nmarried. I have come simply to ascertain whether that is the case.\"",

It\nmay be added in her excuse that the manner in which it was put by the\nrepresentative of the company was a perfect example of how a business\nman should address a lady. \"It is the case,\" said she. \"May I ask your ladyship's authority--in strict confidence of course?\" enquired the representative firmly, but very courteously. \"I learned it from my own man of business,\" said she. \"Thank you,\" said the insurance representative. \"I beg that your\nladyship will say nothing of my call, and I shall undertake not to\nmention the source of my information,\" and with an adequate bow he\nreturned to the house. Before disappearing through her library window, Mr. Carrington saw that\nher ladyship's back was turned, and he then gave this candid, if\nsomewhat sketchy, account of his interview to her butler. \"It suddenly struck me,\" said he, \"that Lady Cromarty might think it\nsomewhat unseemly of me to come enquiring about shooting so soon after\nher bereavement; so I gave her a somewhat different explanation. She is\nnot likely to make any further enquiries about me and so you need say\nnothing about my visit.\" He was careful however to impress on his friend Mr. Bisset that he\nactually had come from purely sporting motives. In fact he professed\nsome anxiety to get in touch with Sir Malcolm on the subject, even\nthough assured that the young baronet had nothing to do with the\nshootings. \"Ah, but it will gratify him, Bisset,\" said he, \"and I think it is the\nnice thing to do. Could you give me his London address?\" He jotted this down in his pocket book, and then as he was leaving he\nsaid confidentially:\n\n\"You tell me that you think Sir Malcolm is interested in Miss Farmond,\nthough she seemed not so keen on him?\" \"That was the way of it to my thinking,\" said Bisset. \"And what\ndeduction would you draw from that, sir?\" \"I should deduce,\" said this sympathetic and intelligent visitor, \"the\nprobable appearance of certain evidence bearing on our theories,\nBisset.\" Mr. Bisset thought he had seldom met a pleasanter gentleman or a more\nhelpful assistant.

As a matter of observation I\ndon't find that certain types of men and women commit certain actions,\nand I do find that they are apt to commit others. And contrariwise with\nother types.\" \"Very unsafe doctrine,\" said Simon emphatically. \"Extremely--in the hands of any one who doesn't know how to apply it. On\nthe other hand, it can be made a short and commonsense cut to the truth\nin many cases. For instance, the man who suspected Mr. Bisset of\ncommitting the crime would simply be wasting his time and energy, even\nif there seemed to be some evidence against him.\" \"Any man can commit any crime,\" said Simon dogmatically.

And a good judge of men\nought to be able to perceive this and not waste his time in trying to\nconvict me of an offence I couldn't commit. On the other hand, if the\ncrime was one that my type is apt to commit he would be a fool to acquit\nme off-hand, even if there was next to no evidence against me.\" \"Then you simply go by your impressions of people?\" \"Far from it. A complete absence of motive would force me to acquit even\nthe most promising looking blackguard, unless of course there were some\nform of lunacy in his case. One must have motive and one must have\nevidence as well, but character is the short cut--if the circumstances\npermit you to use it. Sometimes of course they don't, but in this case\nthey force me to depend on it very largely.

Will you send for him or not?\" \"He wouldn't come.\" \"It depends on the urgency of the message.\" \"I can't invent bogus urgent messages to my clients.\" Carrington smiled. \"I might do the inventing for you.\" Again the lawyer stared at him and again there was the same extreme\ncaution in his eye, mingled with a hint of suspicion.",

The amiable visitor was shown\ninto the laird's smoking room--an apartment with vast walls like a\ndungeon and on them trophies from the laird's adventurous days, and\nproceeded to make enquiry whether Mr. Cromarty was disposed to let his\nshootings for next season, or, if not, whether he could recommend any\nothers. As the visitor was in no hurry, he declared, to fix anything up, it was\nvery natural that this conversation, like the morning's, should\neventually turn on to the subject of the great local mystery. Through it\nall Mr. Carrington's monocle was more continually fixed on the other\nthan usual, but if he were looking for peculiarities in the laird's\nmanner or any admissions made either by tongue or eye, he was\ndisappointed. Cromarty was as breezy and as direct as ever, but even\nwhen his visitor confessed his extreme interest in such cases of\nremarkable crime, he (to all seeming) scented nothing in this beyond a\nnot uncommon hobby. There was no doubt, however, of his keenness to\ndiscuss the subject. Carrington gave him an entertaining account of his\nefforts to assist Mr. Bisset, and then Ned asked:\n\n\"Well, what do you think of his theory that the man came in by the\nwindow?\" Carrington smiled. \"Bisset is evidently extremely anxious to save the credit of the\nfamily.\" Ned Cromarty was aroused now. \"Good God!\" he cried. \"But do you mean to say that you think that story\nwill hold water?\" \"What story?\" enquired Carrington mildly. \"You know what I mean--the scandal that Sir Malcolm and--and a lady were\nconcerned in the murder.\" \"They are said to have actually committed it, aren't they?\" Ned's eye began to look dangerous.",

For the space of perhaps two seconds Carrington's eyeglass stared very\nstraight at him, and immediately afterwards was taken out for cleaning\nagain, while its owner seemed to have found some new food for thought.

It seemed as though he were amused at such a tribute\nto the opinion of a mere chance visitor. \"And Sir Malcolm?\" enquired Ned. Carrington shook his head. \"I have no means of judging--yet.\" Ned glanced at him quickly. \"Do you expect to get hold of a means?\" Carrington's smile was his only answer to the question. And then, still\nsmiling, he said:\n\n\"I rather wonder, Mr. Cromarty, that you who have taken so much interest\nin this case, and who are, I am told, the head of the family, don't get\nsome professional assistance to help you to get at the bottom of it.\" Ned's mouth shut hard and his eyes turned to the fire.

In a moment Ned said:\n\n\"Supposing those two are scored out, there doesn't seem to be anybody\nelse inside the house who could have committed the crime, does there? You wouldn't suspect Lady Cromarty or Bisset, would you?\" \"Lady Cromarty is physically incapable of giving her husband the blow he\nmust have received. Besides, they were a very devoted couple, I\nunderstand, and she gained nothing by his death--lost heavily, in fact. As for Bisset----\" Carrington let his smile finish the sentence. \"Then it must have been some one from outside--but who?\" \"Can you think of any one?\" asked Carrington. Ned shook his head emphatically. \"Can you?\" he asked. \"Me?\" said his visitor with an innocent air, and yet with a twinkle for\nan instant in his eye.",

Then take his tradesmen and his agent\nand so on, they all stand to lose too. An illicit love affair and a\nvengeful swain might be a conceivable theory, if his character gave\ncolour to it; but there's not a hint of that, and some rumour would\nhave got about for certain if that had been the case.\" \"You may dismiss that,\" said Ned emphatically. \"Then there you are--what's the motive?\" \"If one could think of a possible man, one could probably think of a\npossible motive.\" On Carrington's face a curious look appeared for an instant. \"I only wish one could,\" he murmured. A gong sounded and Ned rose. \"That means tea,\" said he. \"I always have it in my sister's room. Come\nup.\" They went up the stone stair and turned into Miss Cromarty's boudoir. On\nher, Mr. Carrington produced a favourable impression that was evident at\nonce. At all times she liked good-looking and agreeable gentlemen, and\nlately she had been suffering from a dearth of them. She had been\nsuffering also from her brother's pig-headed refusal to reconsider his\ndecision not to buy a car; and finally from the lack of some one to\nsympathise with her in this matter. In the opulent-looking and\nsportingly attired Mr. Carrington she quickly perceived a kindred\nspirit, and having a tongue that was not easily intimidated even by the\nformidable looking laird, she launched into her grievance. They had been\ntalking about the long distances that separated most of the mansions in\nthe county. \"Isn't it ridiculous, Mr. Carrington,\" said she, \"we haven't got a car!\" \"Absurd,\" agreed Mr. Carrington, helping himself to cake. \"Do you know, this brother of mine here has actually come into a\nfortune, and yet he won't buy me even one little motor car!\" Ned frowned and muttered something that might have checked their\nvisitor's reply, had he noticed the laird's displeasure, but for the\nmoment he seemed to have become very unobserving. \"Come into a fortune?\" said he. \"What a bit of luck! How much--a\nmillion--two million?\" \"Oh, not as much as that, worse luck! But quite enough to buy at least\nthree decent cars if he was half a sportsman!",

But at that moment Mr. Carrington coughed, evidently over a cake crumb,\nand failed to hear the expostulation. \"But perhaps he is going to buy you something even handsomer instead,\"\nhe suggested. \"Is he!\" she scoffed, with a defiant eye on her brother. \"I believe he's\ngoing to blue it in something too scandalous to talk about in mixed\nsociety! Anyhow it's something too mysterious to tell me!\" By this time Ned's face was a thundercloud in which lightning was\nclearly imminent, but Mr. Carrington now recovered his wonted tact as\nsuddenly as he had lost it. \"That reminds me of a very curious story I heard at my club the other\nday,\" he began, and in a few minutes the conversation was far away from\nMiss Cromarty's grievances. And then, having finished his cup of tea, he\nlooked at his watch with an exclamation and protested that he must\ndepart on the instant.

Only\none incident aroused him, and that but for a moment. It was quite dark\nby this time, and somewhere between the Keldale House lodge and the\ntown, the lamps of the car swept for an instant over a girl riding a\nbicycle in the opposite direction. Carrington looked round quickly and\nsaw that she was Miss Cicely Farmond. XXVII\n\nFLIGHT\n\n\nOn the morning after his visit from Mr. Carrington, Ned Cromarty took\nhis keeper with him and drove over to shoot on a friend's estate. He\nstayed for tea and it was well after five o'clock and quite dark when he\nstarted on his long drive home. The road passed close to a wayside\nstation with a level crossing over the line, and when they came to this\nthe gates were closed against them and the light of the signal of the up\nline had changed from red to white. \"Train's up to time,\" said Ned to the keeper. \"I thought we'd have got\nthrough before she came.\" There was no moon, a fine rain hung in the air, and the night was\nalready pitch dark. Sitting there in the dogcart before the closed\ngates, behind the blinding light of the gig lamps, they were quite\ninvisible themselves; but about thirty yards to their left they saw the\nstation platform plainly in the radiance of its lights, and, straight\nbefore them in the radiance of their own, they could see less distinctly\nthe road beyond the line. At first, save for the distant rumble of the southward bound train,\nthere was no sign of life or of movement anywhere, and then all at once\na figure on a bicycle appeared on the road, and in a moment dismounted\nbeside the station. It was a girl in black, and at the sight of her, Ned\nbent forward suddenly in his driving seat and stared intently into the\nnight. He saw her unstrap a small suit case from the bicycle and lead\nthe bicycle into the station.",

The bicycle she had evidently left in the station, and it\nseemed manifest that she was going by this train. \"That's Miss Farmond, sir, from Keldale House!\" exclaimed the keeper. His master said nothing but kept his eye intently fixed on the girl. One\nof the platform lamps lit her plainly, and he thought she looked the\nmost forlorn and moving sight that had ever stirred his heart. There was\nsomething shrinking in her attitude, and when she looked once for a few\nmoments straight towards him, there seemed to be something both sad and\nfrightened in her face. Not another soul was on the platform, and seen\nin that patch of light against an immensity of dark empty country and\nblack sky, she gave him such an impression of friendlessness that he\ncould scarcely stay in his seat. And all the while the roar of the\non-coming train was growing louder and ever louder. In a few minutes she\nwould be gone--\"Where?\" he asked himself. \"I'm wondering where she'll be going at this time o' night with nae\nmair luggage than yon,\" said the keeper. That decided it. \"Take the trap home and tell Miss Cromarty not to expect me to-night,\"\nsaid his master, quickly. \"Say I've gone--oh, anywhere you derned well\nlike! There's something up and I'm going to see what it is.\" He jumped quietly on the road just as the engine thundered between the\ngates in front. By the time the train was at rest, he was over the gate\nand making his way to the platform. He stopped in the darkness by the\nrear end of the train till he saw the figure in black disappear into a\ncarriage, and then he stepped into a compartment near the guard's van. \"Haven't got a ticket, but I'll pay as I go along,\" he said to the guard\nas he passed the window. The guard knew Mr. Cromarty well and touched his cap, and then the train\nstarted and Mr. Cromarty was embarked upon what he confessed to himself\nwas the blindest journey he had ever made in all his varied career. Where was she going--and why was she going? He asked himself these\nquestions over and over again as he sat with a cigar between his teeth\nand his long legs stretched out on the opposite seat, and the train\ndrove on into an ever wilder and more desolate land. It would be very\nmany miles and a couple of hours or more before they reached any sort of\nconceivable destination for her, and as a matter of fact this train did\nnot go beyond that destination. Then it struck him sharply that up till\nthe end of last month the train had continued its southward journey. The\nalteration in the timetable was only a few days old. Possibly she was\nnot aware of it and had counted on travelling to--where? He knew where\nshe had got to stop, but where had she meant to stop? Or where would she\ngo to-morrow? And above all, why was she going at all, leaving her\nbicycle at a wayside station and with her sole luggage a small suit\ncase? Ned shook his head, tried to suck life into his neglected cigar,\nand gave up the problem in the meanwhile. As to the question of what business he had to be following Miss Farmond\nlike this, he troubled his head about it not at all.",

He looked out of the\nwindow at each of them, but she never alighted. \"She's going to find herself stuck for the night. That's about the size\nof it,\" he said to himself as they left the last station before the\njourney ended. Though their next stop was the final stop, he did not open the carriage\ndoor when the train pulled up. He did not even put his head far out of\nthe window, only just enough to see what passed on the platform ahead. \"I'm not going to worry her if she doesn't need me,\" he said to himself.

He was out of the carriage and after her in an instant. Beyond the\nstation the darkness was intense and he had almost passed a road\nbranching to the left without seeing it. He stopped and was going to\nturn down it when it struck him the silence was intense that way, but\nthat there was a light sound of retreating footsteps straight ahead. \"She's missed the turning!\" he said to himself, and followed the\nfootsteps. In a little he could see her against the sky, a dim hurrying figure, and\nhis own stride quickened. He had never been in this place before, but he\nknew it for a mere seaboard village with an utterly lonely country on\nevery inland side. She was heading into a black wilderness, and he took\nhis decision at once and increased his pace till he was overhauling her\nfast. At the sound of his footsteps he could see that she glanced over her\nshoulder and made the more haste till she was almost running. And then\nas she heard the pursuing steps always nearer she suddenly slackened\nspeed to let him pass. \"Miss Farmond!\" said he. He could hear her gasp as she stopped short and turned sharply. She was\nstaring hard now at the tall figure looming above her. \"It's only me--Ned Cromarty,\" he said quietly. And then he started in turn, for instead of showing relief she gave a\nhalf smothered little cry and shrank away from him. For a moment there\nwas dead silence and then he said, still quietly, though it cost him an\neffort. \"I only mean to help you if you need a hand. Are you looking for the\nhotel?\" \"Yes,\" she said in a low frightened voice. \"Well,\" said he, \"I guess you'd walk till morning before you reached an\nhotel along this road. You missed the turning at the station. Give me\nyour bag.

Walk right in, my dear!\" XXVIII\n\nTHE RETURN\n\n\nHis friends would scarcely have picked out Mr. Ned Cromarty of\nStanesland as likely to make a distinguished actor, but they might have\nchanged their opinion had they heard him breezily announce himself as\nMr. Dawkins from Liverpool and curse the Scottish railways which had\nlost his luggage for him. It is true that the landlord looked at him a\ntrifle askance and that the landlady and her maid exchanged a knowing\nsmile when he ordered a room for his niece Louisa, but few people shut\nup in a little country inn with such a formidable looking, loud voiced\ngiant, would have ventured to question his statements openly, and the\nequanimity of Mr. Dawkins remained undisturbed. \"Sit right down, Louisa!\" he commanded when dinner was served; and then,\naddressing the maid, \"You needn't wait. We'll ring when we need you.\" But the moment she had gone he checked a strong expression with an\neffort. \"Damn--confound it!\" he cried. \"I ought to have remembered to say grace! That would have given just the finishing touch to the Uncle Ned\nbusiness. However, I don't think they've smelt any rats.\" Cicely smiled faintly and then her eyes fell and she answered nothing. Their only other conversation during dinner consisted in his\nexpostulations on her small appetite and her low-voiced protests that\nshe wasn't hungry. But when it was safely over, he pushed back his\nchair, crossed his knees, and began:\n\n\"Now, Louisa, I'm going to take an uncle's privilege of lighting my pipe\nbefore I begin to talk, if you don't mind.\" He lit his pipe, and then suddenly dropping the r\u00f4le of uncle\naltogether, said gently:\n\n\"I don't want to press you with any questions that you don't want to\nanswer, but if you need a friend of any sort, size, or description, here\nI am.\" He paused for a moment and then asked still more gently: \"Are you\nafraid of me?\"",

But he was not to be soothed by a tear, even in the most adroit lady's\neye. \"The latest consequence has been,\" he said sternly, \"that through a\nmixture of persecution and bad advice she has been driven to run away. Luckily I spotted her at the start and fetched her back, and I've told\nher that if there is the least little bit more trouble she is to come\nstraight here and that you will give her as good a welcome as I shall. Is that quite clear?\" \"Yes,\" she murmured through her handkerchief. \"Otherwise,\" said he, \"there's no room for us both here. One single\nsuggestion that she isn't welcome--and you have full warning now of the\nconsequences!\" \"When is she coming?\" she asked in an uncertain voice. \"When? Possibly never. But there's some very fishy--and it looks to me,\nsome very dirty business going on, and this port stands open in case of\na storm. You fully understand?\" \"Of course I do,\" she said, putting away her handkerchief. \"I'm not\nquite a fool!\" And indeed, none of her friends or acquaintances had ever made that\naccusation against Lilian Cromarty. \"Well, that's all,\" said Ned, and began to move across the room. But now the instinct for finding a scapegoat began to revive. \"Who did you tell it to, Ned?\" she asked. \"Simon Rattar.\" \"Then _he_ has spread this dreadful story!\" she exclaimed with righteous\nindignation. Her brother stopped and slowly turned back. \"By heaven, I've scarcely had time to think it all out yet--but it looks\nlike it!\" \"It _must_ be that nasty grumpy old creature! If you told nobody\nelse--well, it can't be anybody else!\" \"But why should he go and spread such a story?\" \"Because he wants to shelter some one else!\" \"Who?\" \"Ah, that's for the police to find out. But I'm quite certain, Ned, that\nthat pig-headed old Simon with his cod-fish eyes and his everlasting\ngrunt is at the bottom of it all!\" He stared thoughtfully into space.",

XXX\n\nA MARKED MAN\n\n\nThe unexpected energy displayed by her charming guest in bustling all\nover the country had surprised and a little perplexed Miss Peterkin, but\nshe now decided that it was only a passing phase, for on the day\nfollowing his visits to Keldale and Stanesland he exhibited exactly the\nsame leisurely calm she had admired at first. He sought out the local\ngolf course and for an hour or two his creditable game confirmed his\nreputation as a sportsman, and for the rest of the time he idled in a\nvery gentlemanly manner. In the course of the afternoon he strolled out and gradually drifted\nthrough the dusk towards the station. Finding the train was, as usual,\nindefinitely late, he strolled out again and finally drifted back just\nas the signals had fallen at last. It was quite dark by this time and\nthe platform lamps were lit, but Mr. Carrington chanced to stand\ninconspicuously in a background of shadows. As the engine hissed\nponderously under the station roof and the carriage doors began to open,\nhe still stood there, the most casual of spectators. A few passengers\npassed him, and then came a young man in a fur coat, on whom some very\ncurious glances had been thrown when he alighted from his first class\ncompartment. Mr. Carrington, however, seemed to take no interest either\nin him or anybody else till the young man was actually passing him, and\nthen he suddenly stepped out of the shadows, touched him on the shoulder\nand said in a much deeper and graver voice than usual:\n\n\"Sir Malcolm Cromarty, I believe!\" The young man started violently and turned a pale face. \"Ye--es, I am,\" he stammered. \"May I have a word with you?\" said Carrington gravely. With a dreadfully nervous air Sir Malcolm accompanied him out into the\ndark road, neither speaking, and then the young man demanded hoarsely:\n\n\"What do you want with me?\"",

The fact is Mr.--er----\"\n\n\"Carrington.\" \"Mr. Carrington, that I'm in a most awful position at present. You know\nof course that I'm suspected of murder!\" \"No!\" exclaimed Carrington, with vast interest. \"Not really?\" \"It's an absolute fact--suspected of murder! Good God, just imagine it!\" The young baronet stopped and faced his new acquaintance dramatically. In spite of his nervousness, it was evident that his notoriety had\ncompensations. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I--the head of an ancient and honourable house--am\nactually suspected of having murdered my cousin, Sir Reginald Cromarty!\" \"What, that murder!\" exclaimed Carrington. \"By Jove, of course, I've\nheard a lot about the case. And you are really suspected?\" \"So much so,\" said the baronet darkly, \"that when you touched me on the\nshoulder I actually thought you were going to arrest me!\" Carrington seemed equally astounded and penitent at this unfortunate\nreading of his simple and natural action in stepping suddenly out of the\ndark and tapping a nervous stranger on the shoulder. \"How very tactless of me!\" he repeated more than once. \"Really, I must\nbe more careful another time!\" And then he suddenly turned his monocle on to the baronet and enquired:\n\n\"But how do you know you are suspected?\" \"How do I know! My God, all fingers are pointing at me! Even in my club\nin London I feel I am a marked man. I have discussed my awful position\nwith all my friends, and by this time they tell me that everybody else\nknows too!\" \"That is--er--not unnatural,\" said Carrington drily. \"But how did you\nfirst learn?\" The young man's voice fell almost to a whisper and he glanced\napprehensively over his shoulder as he spoke. \"I knew I should be suspected the moment I heard of the crime!

Mind\nyou, I am not as a rule a silly ass,\" the baronet added with dignity,\n\"but that night I actually confided in a woman!\" \"What woman?\"' \"My relative Miss Cicely Farmond--a charming girl, I may mention; there\nwas every excuse for me, still it was a rotten thing to do, I quite\nadmit.

XXXI\n\nTHE LETTER AGAIN\n\n\nOn the morning after Sir Malcolm's fleeting visit to the Kings Arms, the\nmanageress was informed by her friend Mr. Carrington that he would like\na car immediately after breakfast. \"I really must be a little more energetic, or I'll never find anything\nto suit me,\" he smiled in his most leisurely manner. \"I am thinking of\nrunning out to Keldale to have another look at the place.

The unfortunate man\nhad clearly not been himself, probably for some little time previously. Well, I'll make a few more enquiries, but I fancy my work is nearly at\nan end. Good-morning.\" He rose and was half way across the room, when he stopped and asked, as\nif the idea had suddenly occurred to him:\n\n\"By the way, I hear that Miss Farmond was in seeing you a couple of days\nago.\" Again Simon seemed to start a little, and again he hesitated for an\ninstant and then replied with a grunt. \"Had she any news?\" asked the other. Simon grunted again and shook his head, and Carrington threw him a\nfriendly nod and went out. He maintained the same air till he had turned down a bye street and was\nalone, and only then he gave vent to his feelings. \"I'm dashed!\" he muttered, \"absolutely jiggered!\" All the while he shook his head and slashed with his walking stick\nthrough the air. There was no doubt that Mr. Carrington was thoroughly\nand genuinely puzzled. XXXII\n\nTHE SYMPATHETIC STRANGER\n\n\nCarrington's soliloquy was interrupted by the appearance of someone on\nthe pavement ahead of him. He pulled himself together, took out his\nwatch, and saw that it was still only twenty minutes past twelve. After\nthinking for a moment, he murmured:\n\n\"I might as well try 'em!\" And thereupon he set out at a brisk walk, and a few minutes later was\ncloseted with Superintendent Sutherland in the Police Station. He began\nby handing the Superintendent a card with the name of Mr. F. T.\nCarrington on it, but with quite a different address from that on the\ncard he had sent up to Mr. Rattar. It was, in fact, his business card,\nand the Superintendent regarded him with respectful interest. After explaining his business and his preference for not disclosing it\nto the public, he went briefly over the main facts of the case. \"I see you've got them all, sir,\" said the Superintendent, when he had\nfinished. \"There really seems nothing to add and no new light to be seen\nanywhere.\" \"I'm afraid so,\" agreed Carrington. \"I'm afraid so.\" In fact he seemed so entirely resigned to this conclusion that he\nallowed, and even encouraged, the conversation to turn to other matters. The activity and enterprise of the Procurator Fiscal seemed to have\nparticularly impressed him, and this led to a long talk on the subject\nof Mr. Simon Rattar.",

      "passage": "The Superintendent was also a great admirer of the\nFiscal and assured Mr. Carrington that not only was Mr. Simon himself\nthe most capable and upright of men, but that the firm of Rattar had\nalways conducted its business in a manner that was above reproach. Mr.\nCarrington had made one or two slightly cynical but perfectly\ngood-natured comments on lawyers in general, but he got no countenance\nfrom the Superintendent so far as Mr. Rattar and his business were\nconcerned. \"But hadn't he some trouble at one time with his brother?\" his visitor\nenquired. The Superintendent admitted that this was so, and also that Sir Reginald\nCromarty had suffered thereby, but he was quite positive that this\ntrouble was entirely a thing of the past. There was no doubt that this\ninformation had a somewhat depressing effect even on the good-humoured\nMr. Carrington, and at last he confessed with a candid air:\n\n\"The fact is, Superintendent, that I have a theory Sir Reginald was\nworrying about something before his death, and as all his business\naffairs are conducted by Mr. Rattar, I was wondering whether he had any\ndifficulties in that direction. Now about this bad brother of Mr.\nRattar's--there couldn't be trouble still outstanding, you think?\" \"Mr. George Rattar was out of the firm, sir, years ago,\" the\nSuperintendent assured him. \"No, it couldna be that.\" \"And Mr. George Rattar certainly died a short time ago, did he?\" \"I can show you the paper with his death in it. I kept it as a kind of\nrecord of the end of him.\" He fetched the paper and Carrington after looking at it for a few\nminutes, remarked:\n\n\"I see here an advertisement stating that Mr. Rattar lost a ring.\" \"Yes,\" said the Superintendent, \"that was a funny thing because it's not\noften a gentleman loses a ring off his hand. I've half wondered since\nwhether it was connected with a story of Mr. Rattar's maid that his\nhouse had been broken into.\" \"When was that?\" \"Curiously enough it was the very night Sir Reginald was murdered.\" Carrington's chair squeaked on the floor as he sat up sharply. \"The very night of the murder?\" he repeated. \"Why has this never come\nout before?\" The stolid Superintendent looked at him in surprise. \"But what connection could there possibly be, sir? Mr. Rattar thought\nnothing of it himself and just mentioned it so that I would know it was\na mere story, in case his servants started talking about it.\" \"But you yourself seemed just now to think that it might not be a mere\nstory.\" \"Oh, that was just a kind o' idea,\" said the Superintendent easily. \"It\nonly came in my mind when the ring was never recovered.\" \"What were the exact facts?\" demanded Carrington. \"Oh,\" said the Superintendent vaguely, \"there was something about a\nwindow looking as if it had been entered, but really, sir, Mr. Rattar\npaid so little attention to it himself, and we were that taken up by the\nKeldale case that I made no special note of it.\" \"Did the servants ever speak of it again?\" \"Everybody was that taken up about the murder that I doubt if they've\nminded on it any further.\" Carrington was silent for a few moments. \"Are the servants intelligent girls?\" he enquired. \"Oh, quite average intelligent.",

This time his\nair as he walked was noticeably brisker and his eye decidedly brighter. About three o'clock that afternoon came a ring at the front door bell of\nMr. Simon Rattar's commodious villa. Mary MacLean declared afterwards\nthat she had a presentiment when she heard it, but then the poor girl\nhad been rather troubled with presentiments lately. When she opened the\nfront door she saw a particularly polite and agreeable looking gentleman\nadorned with that unmistakeable mark of fashion, a single eyeglass; and\nthe gentleman saw a pleasant looking but evidently high strung and\nnervous young woman. \"Is Mr. Simon Rattar at home?\" he enquired in a courteous voice and with\na soothing smile that won her heart at once; and on hearing that Mr.\nRattar always spent the afternoons at his office and would not return\nbefore five o'clock, his disappointment was so manifest that she felt\nsincerely sorry for him. He hesitated and was about to go away when a happy idea struck him. \"Might I come in and write a line to be left for him?\" he asked, and\nMary felt greatly relieved at being able to assist the gentleman to\nassuage his disappointment in this way. She led him into the library and somehow or other by the time she had\ngot him ink and paper and pen she found herself talking to this\ndistinguished looking stranger in the most friendly way. It was not that\nhe was forward or gallant, far from it; simply that he was so nice and\nso remarkably sympathetic. Within five minutes of making his\nacquaintance, Mary felt that she could tell him almost anything. This sympathetic visitor made several appreciative remarks about the\nhouse and garden, and then, just as he had dipped his pen into the ink,\nhe remarked:\n\n\"Rather a tempting house for burglars, I should think--if such people\nexisted in these peaceable parts.\" \"Oh, but they do, sir,\" she assured him. \"We had one in this very house\none night!\" XXXIII\n\nTHE HOUSE OF MYSTERIES\n\n\nThe sympathetic stranger almost laid down his pen, he was so interested\nby this unexpected reply. \"What!\" he exclaimed. \"Really a burglary in this house? I say, how\nawfully interesting! When did it happen?\" \"Well, sir,\" said Mary in an impressive voice, \"it's a most\nextraordinary thing, but it was actually the very self same night of Sir\nReginald's murder!\" So surprised and interested was the visitor that he actually did lay\ndown his pen this time. \"Was it the same man, do you think?\" he asked in a voice that seemed to\nthrill with sympathetic excitement. \"Indeed I've sometimes wondered!\" said she. \"Tell me how it happened!\" \"Well, sir,\" said Mary, \"it was on the very morning that we heard about\nSir Reginald--only before we'd heard, and I was pulling up the blinds in\nthe wee sitting room when I says to myself. 'There's been some one in at\nthis window!'\" \"The wee sitting room,\" repeated her visitor. \"Which is that?\"",

It had evidently been intended for a smoking room or study when\nthe villa was built, but was clearly never used by Mr. Rattar, for it\ncontained little furniture beyond bookcases. Its window looked on to the\nside of the garden and not towards the drive, and a grass lawn lay\nbeneath it, while the room itself was obviously the most isolated, and\nfrom a burglarious point of view the most promising, on the ground\nfloor. \"This is the room, sir,\" said Mary. \"And look! You still can see the\nmarks on the sash.\" \"Yes,\" said the visitor thoughtfully, \"they seem to have been made by a\ntacketty boot.\" \"And forbye that, there was a wee bit mud on the floor and a tacket mark\nin that!\" \"Was the window shut or open?\" \"Shut, sir; and the most extraordinary thing was that it was snibbed\ntoo! That's what made the master say it couldna have been a burglar at\nall, or how did he snib the window after he went out again?\" \"Then Mr. Rattar didn't believe it was a burglar?\" \"N--no, sir,\" said Mary, a little reluctantly. \"Was anything stolen?\" \"No, sir; that was another funny thing. But it must have been a\nburglar!\" \"What about the other windows, and the doors? Were they all fastened in\nthe morning?\" \"Yes, sir, it's the truth they were,\" she admitted. \"And what did Mr. Rattar do with the piece of mud?\" \"Just threw it out of the window.\" The sympathetic stranger crossed to the window and looked out. \"Grass underneath, I see,\" he observed. \"No footprints outside, I\nsuppose?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Did the police come down and make enquiries?\" \"Well, sir, the master said he would inform the pollis, but then came\nthe news of the murder, and no one had any thoughts for anything else\nafter that.\" The sympathetic visitor stood by the window very thoughtfully for a few\nmoments, and then turned and rewarded her with the most charming smile. \"Thank you awfully for showing me all this,\" said he. \"By the way,\nwhat's your name?\" She told him and he added with a still nicer smile,\n\"Thank you, Mary!\" They returned to the library and he sat down before the table again, but\njust as he was going to pick up the pen a thought seemed to strike him. \"By the way,\" he said, \"I remember hearing something about the loss of a\nring. The burglar didn't take that, did he?\" \"Oh, no, sir, I remember the advertisement was in the paper before the\nnight of the burglary.\" He opened his eyes and then smiled. \"Brilliant police you've got!\" he murmured, and took up the pen again. \"There was another burglar here and he might have taken it!\" said Mary\nin a low voice. The visitor once more dropped the pen and looked up with a start. \"Another burglar!\" he exclaimed. \"Well, sir, this one didn't actually burgle, but--\"\n\nShe thought of the master if he chanced to learn how she had been\ngossiping, and her sentence was cut short in the midst. \"Yes, Mary!",

Her visitor was so\ninterested that once she began it was really impossible to stop. \"How very strange!\" he murmured, and there was no doubt he meant it. \"But about the master's ring, sir--\" she began. \"You say he looked as though he were being _watched_?\" he interrupted,\nbut it was quite a polite and gentle interruption. \"Yes, sir; but the funny thing about losing the ring was that he never\ncould get it off his finger before! I've seen him trying to, but oh, it\nwouldn't nearly come off!\" Again he sat up and gazed at her. \"Another mystery!\" he murmured. \"He lost a ring which wouldn't come off\nhis finger? By Jove! That's very rum. Are there any more mysteries,\nMary, connected with this house?\" She hesitated and then in a very low voice answered:\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir; there was one that gave me even a worse turn!\" By this time her visitor seemed to have given up all immediate thoughts\nof writing his note to Mr. Rattar. He turned his back to the table and\nlooked at her with benevolent calm. \"Let's hear it, Mary,\" he said gently. And then she told him the story of that dreadful night when the unknown\nvisitor came for the box of old papers. He gazed at her, listening very\nattentively, and then in a soothing voice asked her several questions,\nmore particularly when all these mysterious events occurred. \"And are these all your troubles now, Mary?\" he enquired. He asked so sympathetically that at last she even ventured to tell him\nher latest trouble. Till he fairly charmed it out of her, she had shrunk\nfrom telling him anything that seemed to reflect directly on her master\nor to be a giving away of his concerns. But now she confessed that Mr.\nRattar's conduct, Mr. Rattar's looks, and even Mr. Rattar's very\ninfrequent words had been troubling her strangely. How or why his looks\nand words should trouble her, she knew not precisely, and his conduct,\ngenerally speaking, she admitted was as regular as ever. \"You don't mean that just now and then he takes a wee drop too much?\" enquired her visitor helpfully. \"Oh, no, sir,\" said she, \"the master never did take more than what a\ngentleman should, and he's not a smoking gentleman either--quite a\nprinciple against smokers, he has, sir. Oh, it's nothing like that!\" She looked over her shoulder fearfully as though the walls might repeat\nher words to the master, as she told him of the curious and disturbing\nthing. Mr. Rattar had been till lately a gentleman of the most exact\nhabits, and then all of a sudden he had taken to walking in his garden\nin a way he never did before. First she had noticed him, about the time\nof the burglary and the removal of the papers, walking there in the\nmornings. That perhaps was not so very disturbing, but since then he had\nchanged this for a habit of slipping out of the house every night--every\nsingle night! \"And walking in the garden!\" exclaimed Mr. Carrington. \"Sometimes I've heard his footsteps on the gravel, sir!",

Not a word\nwas written on the paper yet. \"Look here, Mary,\" he said very confidentially. \"I am a friend of Mr.\nRattar's and I am sure you would like me to try and throw a little light\non this. Perhaps something is troubling him and I could help you to\nclear it up.\" \"Oh, sir,\" she cried, \"you are very kind! I wish you could!\" \"Perhaps the best thing then,\" he suggested, \"would be for me not to\nleave a note for him after all, and for you not even to mention that I\nhave called. As he knows me pretty well he would be almost sure to ask\nyou whether I had come in and if I had left any message and so on, and\nthen he might perhaps find out that we had been talking, and that\nwouldn't perhaps be pleasant for you, would it?\" \"Oh, my! No, indeed, it wouldn't!\" she agreed. \"I'm that feared of the\nmaster, sir, I'd never have him know I had been talking about him, or\nabout anything that has happened in this house!\" So, having come to this judicious decision, Mr. Carrington wished Mary\nthe kindest of farewells and walked down the drive again. There could be\nno question he had plenty to think about now, though to judge from his\nexpression, it seemed doubtful whether his thoughts were very clear.

Did you know I'd happened to see her start and gone after\nher and brought her back?\" Carrington's interest was manifest. \"No,\" said he, \"that's quite news to me.\" \"Well, I did, and I learnt the whole story from her. You can't guess who\nadvised her to bolt?\" \"I think I can,\" said Carrington quietly. \"Either you're on the wrong track, or you've cut some ice, Mr.\nCarrington.

As to what we are to do--also nothing\nin the meantime. But as to how I guessed, well I can tell you this much.

He gave me, however, one very\ninteresting piece of information. Rattar had advised him to keep away\nfrom these parts, and for choice to go abroad. I need hardly ask whether\nyou consider that sound advice to give a suspected man.\" \"Seems to me nearly as rotten advice as he gave Miss Farmond.\" \"Exactly. So when I heard that Miss Farmond had flown and discovered she\nhad paid a visit to Mr. Rattar the previous day, I guessed who had given\nher the advice.\" Carrington sat back in his chair with folded arms and looked at his\nemployer with a slight smile, as much as to say, \"Tell me the rest of\nthe story!\" Cromarty returned his gaze in silence, his heaviest frown\nupon his brow. \"It seems to me,\" said Ned at last, \"that Simon Rattar is mixed up in\nthis business--sure! He has something to hide and he's trying to put\npeople off the scent, I'll lay my bottom dollar!\" \"What is he hiding?\" enquired Carrington, looking up at the ceiling. \"What do you think?\" Carrington shook his head, his eyes still gazing dreamily upwards. \"I wish to Heaven I knew what to think!\" he murmured; and then he\nresumed a brisker air and continued, \"I am ready to suspect Simon Rattar\nof any crime in the calendar--leaving out petty larceny and probably\nbigamy. But he's the last man to do either good or evil unless he saw a\ndividend at the end, and where does he score by taking any part or\nparcel in conniving at or abetting or concealing evidence or anything\nelse, so far as this particular crime is concerned? He has lost his best\nclient, with whom he was on excellent terms and whose family he had\nserved all his life, and he has now got instead an unsatisfactory young\nass whom he suspects, or says he suspects, of murder, and who so\nloathes Rattar that, as far as I can judge, he will probably take his\nbusiness away from him. To suspect Rattar of actually conniving at, or\ntaking any part in the actual crime itself is, on the face of it, to\nconvict either Rattar or oneself of lunacy!\" \"I knew Sir Reginald pretty well,\" said Ned, \"but of course I didn't\nknow much about his business affairs. He hadn't been having any trouble\nwith Rattar, had he?\" Carrington threw him a quick, approving glance. \"We are thinking on the same lines,\" said he, \"and I have unearthed one\nvery odd little misunderstanding, but it seems to have been nothing more\nthan that, and, apart from it, all accounts agree that there was no\ntrouble of any kind or description.\" He took a cigarette out of his case and struck a match. \"There must be _some_ motive for everything one does--even for smoking\nthis cigarette. If I disliked cigarettes, knew smoking was bad for me,\nand stood in danger of being fined if I was caught doing it, why should\nI smoke? I can see no point whatever in Rattar's taking the smallest\nshare even in diverting the course of justice by a hair's breadth.",

They were not quite so becoming\nas his ordinary garb, she thought, but then Mr. Carrington looked the\ngentleman in anything. \"Are you going to desert us to-night, Mr. Carrington?\" asked the\nmanageress. \"I have a letter or two to post,\" said he, \"they are an excuse for a\nstroll. I want a breath of fresh air.\" He closed the glass door of the hotel behind him and stood for a moment\non the pavement in the little circle of radiance thrown by the light of\nthe hall. Mr. Carrington's leisurely movements undoubtedly played no\nsmall part in the unsuspecting confidence which he inspired. Out of the\nlight he turned, strolling easily, down the long stretch of black\npavement with its few checkers of lamplight here and there, and the\nempty, silent street of the little country town at his side. It was a\nvery dark, moonless night, and the air was almost quite still. Looking\nupward, he could see a rare star or two twinkle, but all the rest of the\nHeavens were under cloud. Judging from his contented expression the\nnight seemed to please him. He passed the post office, but curiously enough omitted to drop any\nletters into the box. The breath of fresh air seemed, in fact, to be his\nsole preoccupation. Moving with a slightly quickened stride, but still\neasily, he turned out of that street into another even quieter and\ndarker, and in a short time he was nearing the lights of the station. He\ngave these a wide birth, however, and presently was strolling up a very\nsecluded road, with a few villas and gardens upon the one side, and\nblack space on the other. There for a moment he stopped and transferred\nsomething from the pocket of his inner coat into the pocket of his top\ncoat. It was a small compact article, and a ray of light from a\nlamp-post behind him gleamed for an instant upon a circular metal\norifice at one end of it. Before he moved on, he searched the darkness intently, before him and\nbehind, but saw no sign of any other passenger. And then he turned the\nrim of his dark felt hat down over his face, stepped out briskly for\nsome fifty yards further, and turned sharply through an open gate. Once\nagain he stopped and listened keenly, standing now in the shadow of the\ntrees beside the drive. In his dark top coat and with his hat turned\nover his face he was as nearly invisible as a man could be, but even\nthis did not seem to satisfy him, for in a moment he gently parted the\nbranches of the trees and pushed through the belt of planting to the\nlawn beyond. The villa of Mr. Simon Rattar was now half seen beyond the curving end\nof the belt that bounded the drive. It was dim against the night sky,\nand the garden was dimmer still. Carrington kept on the grass, following\nthe outside of the trees, and then again plunged into them when they\ncurved round at the top of the drive. Pushing quietly through, he\nreached the other side, and there his expedition in search of fresh air\nseemed to have found its goal, for he leaned his back against a tree\ntrunk, folded his arms, and waited.",

A ray came from the fanlight over the front\ndoor and a faint radiance escaped through the slats of the library\nblinds, but otherwise the villa was a lump of darkness in the dark. One minute after another passed without event and with scarcely even the\nfaintest sound. Then, all at once, a little touch of breeze sprang up\nand sighed overhead through the tree tops, and from that time on, there\nwas an alternation of utter silence with the sough of branches gently\nstirred. From a church tower in the town came the stroke of a clock. Carrington\ncounted nine and his eyes were riveted on the front door now. Barely\ntwo more minutes passed before it opened quietly; a figure appeared for\nan instant in the light of the hall, and then, as quietly, the door\nclosed again. There was a lull at the moment, but Carrington could hear\nnot a sound. The figure must be standing very still on the doorstep,\nlistening--evidently listening. And then the thickset form of Simon\nRattar appeared dimly on the gravel, crossing to the lawn beyond. The\npebbles crunched a little, but not very much. He seemed to be walking\nwarily, and when he reached the further side he stood still again and\nCarrington could see his head moving, as though he were looking all\nround him through the night. But now the figure was moving again, coming this time straight for the\nhead of the belt of trees. Carrington had drawn on a pair of dark\ngloves, and he raised his arm to cover the lower part of his face,\nlooking over it through the branches, and facing the silent owner of the\ngarden, till there were hardly three paces between them, the one on the\nlawn, the other in the heart of the plantation. And then when Simon was exactly opposite, he stopped dead. Carrington's\nother hand slipped noiselessly into the pocket where he had dropped that\nlittle article, but otherwise he never moved a muscle and he breathed\nvery gently. The man on the turf seemed to be doing something with his\nhands, but what, it was impossible to say. The hands would move into his\npocket and then out again, till quite three or four minutes had passed,\nand then came a sudden flash of light. Carrington's right hand moved\nhalfway out of his pocket and then was stayed, for by the light of the\nmatch he saw a very singular sight. Simon Rattar was not looking at him. His eyes were focussed just before\nhis nose where the bowl of a pipe was beginning to glow. Carrington\ncould hear the lips gently sucking, and then the aroma of tobacco came\nin a strong wave through the trees. Finally the match went out, and the\nglowing pipe began to move slowly along the turf, keeping close to the\nshelter of the trees. For a space Carrington stood petrified with wonder, and then, very\ncarefully and quite silently, he worked his way through the trees out on\nto the turf, and at once fell on his hands and knees. Had any one been\nthere to see, they would have beheld for the next five minutes a strange\nprocession of two slowly moving along the edge of the plantation; a\nthickset man in front smoking a pipe and something like a great gorilla\nstalking him from behind.",

Simon was now in a secluded path with shrubs on either\nhand, and instead of continuing his tour, he turned at the end of this\npath and paced slowly back again.

While waiting for the boots, Mr. Carrington asked another casual\nquestion or two and learned that Mr. Ison had been in the office since\nhe was a boy. No man knew the house of Rattar throughout its two\ngenerations better than Mr. Ison, said Miss Peterkin; and she remembered\nafterwards that this information seemed to give Mr. Carrington peculiar\nsatisfaction. He seemed so gratified, indeed, that she wondered a little\nat the time.

XXXVI\n\nTHE WALKING STICK\n\n\nHad there been, next morning, any curious eyes to watch the conduct of\nthe gentleman who had come to rent a sporting estate, they would\nprobably have surmised that he had found something to please his fancy\nstrangely, and yet that some perplexity still persisted. They would also\nhave put him down as a much more excitable, and even demonstrative,\nyoung man than they had imagined. On a lonely stretch of shore hard by\nthe little town he paced for nearly an hour, his face a record of the\ndebate within, and his cane gesticulating at intervals. Of a sudden he stopped dead and his lips moved in a murmured\nejaculation, and then after standing stock still for some minutes, he\nmurmured again:\n\n\"Ten to one on it!\" His cane had been stationary during this pause. Now he raised it once\nmore, but this time with careful attention. It was a light bamboo with a\nsilver head. He looked at it thoughtfully, bent it this way and that,\nand then drove it into the sand and pressed it down. Though to the\nordinary eye a very chaste and appropriate walking stick for such a\ngentleman as Mr. Carrington, the result of these tests seemed to\ndissatisfy him. He shook his head, and then with an air of resolution\nset out for the town. A little later he entered a shop where a number of walking sticks were\non view and informed the proprietor that he desired to purchase\nsomething more suitable for the country than the cane he carried. In\nfact, his taste seemed now to run to the very opposite extreme, for the\npoints on which he insisted were length, stiffness, and a long and if\npossible somewhat pointed ferule. At last he found one to his mind, left\nhis own cane to be sent down to the hotel, and walked out with his new\npurchase. His next call was at Mr. Simon Rattar's villa. This morning he\napproached it without any of the curious shyness he had exhibited on the\noccasion of his recent visit. His advance was conducted openly up the\ndrive and in an erect posture, and he crossed the gravel space boldly,\nand even jauntily, while his ring was firmness itself. Mary answered the\nbell, and her pleasure at seeing so soon again the sympathetic gentleman\nwith the eyeglass was a tribute to his tact. \"Good morning, Mary,\" said he, with an air that combined very happily\nthe courtesy of a gentleman with the freedom of an old friend, \"Mr.\nRattar is at his office, I presume.\" She said that he was, but this time the visitor exhibited neither\nsurprise nor disappointment. \"I thought he would be,\" he confessed confidentially, \"and I have come\nto see whether I couldn't do something to help you to get at the bottom\nof these troublesome goings on. Anything fresh happened?\" \"The master was out in the garden again last night, sir!\" said she. \"Was he really?\" cried Mr. Carrington. \"By Jove, how curious! We really\nmust look into that: in fact, I've got an idea I want you to help me\nwith. By the way, it sounds an odd question to ask about Mr. Rattar, but\nhave you ever seen any sign of a pipe or tobacco in the house?\" \"Oh, never indeed!\" said she.",

If neither of you see me, neither\nof you know anything at all.\" She got a last glimpse of his sympathetic smile as she closed the door,\nand then she went faithfully to the kitchen for her talk with cook. It\nwas quite a pleasant gossip at first, but half an hour is a long time to\nkeep talking, when one has been asked not to stop sooner, and it so\nhappened, moreover, that cook was somewhat busy that morning and began\nat length to indicate distinctly that unless her friend had some matter\nof importance to communicate she would regard further verbiage with\ndisfavour. At this juncture Mary decided that twenty minutes was\npractically as good as half an hour, and the conversation ceased. Passing out of the kitchen regions, Mary glanced towards a distant\nwindow, hesitated, and then came to another decision. Mr. Carrington\nmust surely have left the garden now, so there was no harm in peeping\nout. She went to the window and peeped. It was only a two minutes' peep, for Mr. Carrington had not left the\ngarden, and at the end of that space of time something very disturbing\nhappened. But it was long enough to make her marvel greatly at her\nsympathetic friend's method of solving the riddle of the master's\nconduct. When she first saw him, he seemed to be smoothing the earth in\none of the flower beds with his foot. Then he moved on a few paces,\nstopped, and drove his walking stick hard into the bed. She saw him lean\non it to get it further in and apparently twist it about a little. And\nthen he withdrew it again and was in the act of smoothing the place when\nshe saw him glance sharply towards the gate, and the next instant leap\nbehind a bush. Simultaneously the hum of a motor car fell on her ear,\nand Mary was out of the room and speeding upstairs. She heard the car draw up before the house and listened for the front\ndoor bell, but the door opened without a ring and she marvelled and\ntrembled afresh. That the master should return in a car at this hour of\nthe morning seemed surely to be connected with the sin she had connived\nat.",

And then the front door opened and shut again and she\nventured to the window. It was a little open and she could hear her\nmaster speak to the chauffeur as he got in. He was now wearing, she\nnoticed, a heavy overcoat. A moment more and he was off again, down the\ndrive, and out through the gates. When she remembered to look again for\nher sympathetic friend, he was quietly driving his walking stick once\nmore into a flower bed. About ten minutes afterwards the front door bell rang and there stood\nMr. Carrington again. His eye seemed strangely bright, she thought, but\nhis manner was calm and soothing as ever. \"I noticed Mr. Rattar return,\" he said, \"and I thought I would like to\nmake sure that it was all right, before I left. I trust, Mary, that you\nhave got into no trouble on my account.\" She thought it was very kind of him to enquire. \"The master was only just in and out again,\" she assured him. \"He came to get his overcoat, I noticed,\" he remarked. Mr. Carrington's powers of observation struck her as very surprising for\nsuch an easy-going gentleman. \"Yes, sir, that was all.\" \"Well, I'm very glad it was all right,\" he smiled and began to turn\naway. \"By the way,\" he asked, turning back, \"did he tell you where he is\ngoing to now?\" \"He didn't see me, sir.\" \"You didn't happen to overhear him giving any directions to the\nchauffeur, did you? I noticed you at an open window.\" For the first time Mary's sympathetic friend began to make her feel a\ntrifle uncomfortable. His eyes seemed to be everywhere. \"I thought I heard him say 'Keldale House,'\" she confessed. \"Really!\" he exclaimed and seemed to muse for a moment. In fact, he\nappeared to be still musing as he walked away. Mary began to wonder very seriously whether Mr. Carrington was going to\nprove merely a fresh addition to the disquieting mysteries of that\nhouse. XXXVII\n\nBISSET'S ADVICE\n\n\nThe short November afternoon was fading into a gusty evening, as Ned\nCromarty drew near his fortalice. He carried a gun as usual, and as\nusual walked with seven league strides. Where the drive passed through\nthe scrap of stunted plantation it was already dusk and the tortured\nboughs had begun their night of sighs and tossings. Beyond them, pale\ndaylight lingered and the old house stood up still clear against a\nbroken sky and a grey waste with flitting whitecaps all the way to the\nhorizon. He had almost reached the front door when he heard the sound of\nwheels behind him. Pausing there, he spied a pony and a governess' car,\nwith two people distinct enough to bring a sudden light into his eye. The pony trotted briskly towards the door, and he took a stride to meet\nthem. \"Miss Farmond!\" he said. A low voice answered, and though he could not catch the words, the tone\nwas enough for him. And then another voice said:\n\n\"Aye, sir, I've brought her over.\" \"Bisset!\"",

Well, what's happened?\" He was lifting her out of the trap and not hesitating to hold her hand\na little longer than he had ever held it before, now that he could see\nher face quite plainly and read what was in her eyes. \"I've dared to come after all!\" she said, with a little smile, which\nseemed to hint that she knew the risk was over now. \"I advised her vera strongly, sir, to come over with me to Stanesland,\"\nexplained her escort. \"The young lady has had a trying experience at\nKeldale, and forby the fair impossibility of her stopping on under the\nunfortunate circumstances, I was of the opinion that the sea air would\nbe a fine change and the architectural features remarkably interesting. In fac', sir, I practically insisted that Miss Farmond had just got to\ncome.\" \"Good man!\" said Ned. \"Come in and tell me the unfortunate\ncircumstances.\" He bent over Cicely and in a lowered voice added:\n\"Personally I call 'em fortunate--so long as they haven't been too\nbeastly for you!\" \"It's all right now!\" she murmured, and as they went up the steps he\nfound, somehow or other, her hand for an instant in his again. \"If you'll stand by your pony for a moment, Bisset, I'll send out some\none to take her,\" he said with happy inspiration. But Mr. Bisset was not so easily shaken off. \"She'll stand fine for a wee while,\" he assured his host. \"You'll be the\nbetter of hearing all about it from me.\" They went into the smoking room and the escort began forthwith. \"The fact is, Mr. Cromarty, that yon man Simon Rattar is a fair\ndiscredit. Miss Farmond has been telling me the haill story of her\nrunning away, and your ain vera seasonable appearance and judicious\nconduct, sir; which I am bound to say, Mr. Cromarty, is neither more nor\nless than I'd have expectit of a gentleman of your intelligence. Weel,\nto continue, Miss Farmond acted on your advice--which would have been my\nown, sir, under the circumstances--and tellt her ladyship the plain\nfacts. Weel then----\"\n\n\"And what did Lady Cromarty say to you?\" demanded Ned. \"Hardly a word. She simply looked at me and said she would send for Mr. Rattar.\" Not a whit rebuffed, Mr. Bisset straightway resumed his narrative. \"A perfectly proper principle if the man was capable of telling the\ntruth. I'm no blaming her ladyship at that point, but where she departit\nfrom the proper principles of evidence----\"\n\n\"When did Rattar come?\" \"This morning,\" said Cicely. \"And--can you believe it?--he absolutely\ndenied that he had ever advised me to go away!\" \"I can believe it,\" said Ned grimly. \"And I suppose Lady Cromarty\nbelieved him?\" \"God, but you're right, sir!\" cried Bisset. \"Your deductions are\nperfectly correct. Yon man had the impudence to give the haill thing a\nflat denial! And then naturally Miss Farmond was for off, but at first\nher ladyship was no for letting her go. Indeed she went the length of\nsending for me and telling me the young lady was not to be permitted to\nshift her luggage out of the house or use any conveyance.\" \"But Bisset was splendid!\" cried Cicely.",

Detention of luggage like yon\nis no legal. I tellt her ladyship flatly that she'd find herself afore\nthe Shirra', and that I was no going to abet any such proceedings. I\nfurther informed her, sir, of my candid opinion of Simon Rattar, and I\nsaid plainly that he was probably meaning to marry her and get the\nestate under his thumb, and these were the kind o' tricks rascally\nlawyers took in foolish women wi'.\" \"You told Lady Cromarty that!\" exclaimed Ned. \"And what did she say?\" \"We had a few disagreeable passages, as it were, sir,\" said the\nphilosopher calmly. \"And then I borrowed yon trap and having advised\nMiss Farmond to come to Stanesland and she being amenable, I just\nbrought her along to you.\" \"Oh, it was on your advice then?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Cicely and her host exchanged one fleeting glance and then looked\nextremely unconscious. \"She's derned wise!\" said he to himself. He held out his hand to the gratified counsellor. \"Well done, Bisset, you've touched your top form to-day, and I may tell\nyou I've been wanting some one like you badly for a long while, if you\nare willing to stay on with me. Put that in your pipe, Bisset, and smoke\nover it! And now, you know your way, go and get yourself some tea, and a\ndrink of the wildest poison you fancy!\" Hardly was the door closed behind him than the laird put his fate to the\ntest as promptly and directly as he did most other things. \"I want you to stop on too, Cicely--for ever. Will you?\" Her eyes, shyly questioning for a moment and then shyly tender, answered\nhis question before her lips had moved, and it would have been hard to\nconvince them that the minutes which followed ever had a parallel within\nhuman experience. A little later he confessed:\n\n\"Do you know, Cicely, I've always had a funky feeling that if I ever\nproposed my glass eye would drop out!\" The next event was the somewhat sudden entry of Lilian Cromarty, and\nthat lady's self control was never more severely tested or brilliantly\nvindicated. One startled glance, and then she was saying, briskly, and\nwith the old bright smile:\n\n\"A telegram for you, Ned.\" \"Thanks,\" said he. \"By the way, here's the future Mrs. Ned--that's to\nsay if she doesn't funk it before the wedding.\" Lilian's welcome, Lilian's embrace, and Lilian's congratulations were\nalike perfect. Cicely wondered how people could ever have said the\ncritical things of her which some of her acquaintances were unkind\nenough to say at times. As to Bisset's dictum regarding the lady in the\ncastle, that was manifestly absurd on the face of it. Miss Cromarty was\nclearly overjoyed to hear of her brother's engagement. \"And now, Neddy dear!\" cried the bright lady, \"tell me how it all came\nabout!\" Ned looked up from his telegram with a glint in his eye that was hardly\na lover's glance.",

You haven't bought your own gun, I suppose? Take mine.\" He handed him the same little article he had taken out the night before,\nand Ned's eye gleamed. \"What!\" said he. \"That kind of gun once more? This reminds me of old\ntimes!\" \"It's a mere precaution,\" said the other. \"Don't count on using it! Remember, you're going to visit the most respectable citizen of the\ntown--perhaps on a wild goose errand.\" \"I guess not,\" said Ned quietly. \"We daren't assume anything. I don't want to make a fool of myself, and\nno more do you, I take it.\" \"I see,\" said Ned, with a nod. \"Well, I'll keep him in his chair for\nyou.\" \"That's it.\" They were walking quickly through the silent town under the windy night\nsky. It was a dark boisterous evening, not inviting for strollers, and\nthey scarcely passed a soul till they were in the quiet road where the\nvilla stood. There, from the shadows of a gateway, two figures moved out\nto meet them, and Cromarty recognised Superintendent Sutherland and one\nof his constables. The two saluted in silence and fell in behind. They\neach carried, he noticed, something long-shaped wrapped up loosely in\nsacking. \"What have they got there?\" he asked. \"Prosaic instruments,\" smiled Carrington. \"I won't tell you more for\nfear the gamble doesn't come off.\" \"Like the sensation before one proposes, I suppose,\" said Ned. \"Well,\ngoing by that, the omens ought to be all right.\" They turned in through Simon's gates and then the four stopped. \"We part here,\" whispered Carrington. \"Good luck!\" \"Same to you,\" said Ned briefly, and strode up the drive. As he came out into the gravel sweep before the house, he looked hard\ninto the darkness of the garden, but beyond the tossing shapes of trees,\nthere was not a sign of movement. \"Mr. Rattar in?\" he enquired. \"Sitting in the library I suppose?

His voice was restrained and dry, and as he spoke he strode across the\nroom and seated himself deliberately in the arm chair on the side of the\nfire opposite to the lawyer. Simon had banished that first look which Mary saw, but there remained in\nhis eyes something more than their usual cold stare. Each day since\nCarrington came seemed to have aged his face and changed it for the\nworse: a haggard, ugly, malicious face it seemed to his visitor looking\nhard at it to-night. His only greeting was a briefer grunt than\nordinary. \"I daresay you can guess what's brought me here,\" said Ned. The lawyer rapped out his first words jerkily. \"No. I can't.\" \"Try three guesses,\" suggested his visitor. \"Come now, number one----?\" For a moment Simon was silent, but to-night he could not hide the\nworking of that face which usually hid his thoughts so effectually. It\nwas plain he hesitated what line to take. \"You have seen Miss Farmond, I hear,\" he said. \"You're on the scent,\" said his visitor encouragingly. \"Have another\ngo.\" \"You believe her story.\" \"I do.\" \"It's false.\" Ned stared at him very hard and then he spoke deliberately. \"I'm wondering,\" said he. \"Wondering what?\" asked Simon. \"Whether a horse whip or the toe of a shooting boot is the best cure for\nyour complaint.\" The lawyer shrank back into his chair. \"Do you threaten me?\" he jerked out. \"Be careful!\" \"If I threatened you I'd certainly do what I threatened,\" said Ned. \"So\nfar I'm only wondering. Where did you learn to lie, Mr. Rattar?\" The lawyer made no answer at all. His mind seemed concentrated on\nguessing the other's probable actions. \"Out with it, man! I've met some derned good liars in my time, but you\nbeat the lot. I'm anxious to know where you learned the trick, that's\nall.\" \"Why do you believe her more than me?\" asked Simon. \"Because you've been found out lying before. That was a pretty stiff one\nabout your engaging Carrington, wasn't it?\" Simon was quite unable to control his violent start, and his face turned\nwhiter. \"I--I didn't say I did,\" he stammered. \"Well,\" said Ned, \"I admit I wasn't there to hear you, but I know\nCarrington made you put your foot fairly in it just by way of helping\nhim to size you up, and he got your size right enough too.\" \"Then----\" began Simon, and stopped and changed it into: \"What does\nCarrington suspect--er--accuse me of?\" Ned stared at him for several seconds without speaking, and this\nprocedure seemed to disconcert the lawyer more than anything had done\nyet. \"What--what does Carrington mean?\" he repeated. \"He means you've lied, and he believes Miss Farmond, and he believes Sir\nMalcolm, and he believes me, and he puts you down as a pretty bad egg. What did you expect to be accused of?\"",

Mary MacLean stood in the doorway, her face twitching. \"What's the matter?\" snapped her master. \"Please, sir, there are men in the garden!\" she cried.

A couple of\nstrides and he had got the lawyer by the shoulder and pulled him back. \"Sit down!\" he commanded. Simon turned on him with a new expression. The terror had passed away\nand he stood there now as the sheer beast at bay. \"Damn you!\" he muttered, and turned his back for a moment.

Though Simon was tough and stoutly built, he\nwas as a child in the hands of his adversary. A sharp twist of the wrist\nwas followed by an exclamation of pain and the thud of something heavy\non the floor. Ned stooped and picked up the globular glass match box\nthat had stood on the table. For a few moments he stared at it in dead\nsilence, balancing it in his hands. It was like a small cannon ball for\nconcentrated weight. Then in a curious voice he asked:\n\n\"Is this the first time you have used this?\" Simon made no reply. His face was dead white now, but dogged and grim,\nand his mouth stayed tight as a trap. Ned replaced the match box on the\ntable, and planted himself before the fire. \"Nothing to say?\" he asked, and Simon said nothing.

And then came\nfootsteps on the gravel and the ringing of a bell. \"We'll probably learn something now,\" said Ned, but the other still said\nnothing, and only a quick glance towards the door gave a hint of his\nthoughts. There was no announcement this time. Superintendent Sutherland entered\nfirst, then the constable, and Carrington last. The superintendent went\nstraight up to the lawyer, his large face preternaturally solemn. Touching him on the shoulder he said:\n\n\"I arrest you in the King's name!\" The man in the chair half started up and then fell back again. \"What for?\" he asked huskily. \"The murder of Simon Rattar.\" The lawyer took it as one who had seen the sword descending, but not so\nNed Cromarty. \"Of Simon Rattar!\" he shouted.",

I stood talking to him in this\nvery room, he refusing to answer anything except to repeat that he'd buy\na ticket to London and leave it with the stationmaster, and I working\nout the scheme--what to do it with and how to manage afterwards. I knew\nit was a swinging risk, but against that was a starving certainty, and\nthen I spied that match box and the thing was settled. I got him to look\nthe other way for a moment--and then he was settled. Give me another\ndrink!\" Carrington got him a drink and he gulped it down, and then turned\nsuddenly on Ned Cromarty. \"Your damned glass eye has been getting on my nerves long enough!\" he\nexclaimed. \"My God, that eye and your habit of hanging people--I've had\nenough of them! Can't you turn it away from me?\" \"Won't turn,\" said Ned coolly, \"spring broken. Get on with your story!\" Even in his privileged position as prisoner, Rattar seemed disinclined\nto have trouble with his formidable ex-client. He answered nothing, but\nturned his shoulder to him and continued:\n\n\"After that was over I set about covering my tracks. The first part was\nthe worst. Before the maids came back I had to get Simon stowed away for\nthe night--no time to bury him then of course, and I had to get into his\nclothes, shave, and learn the lie of the house and all that. I did it\nall right and came down to breakfast next morning and passed muster with\nthe servants, and never a suspicion raised!\" \"There was a little,\" remarked Carrington, \"but never enough.\" \"Not enough was good enough!\" \"I am not quite certain of that,\" said Carrington. \"However, go on. Your\nnext bunker was the office.\" The prisoner nodded. \"It took some nerve,\" he said complacently, \"and I'm free to confess\nthat to begin with I always had a beastly feeling that some one was\nwatching me and spotting something that didn't look quite right, but,\ngood Lord, keeping my head the way I kept it, there was nothing to worry\nabout! Who would ever think that the Simon Rattar who walked into his\noffice and grunted at his clerks on Wednesday morning, wasn't the same\nSimon Rattar who walked in and grunted on Tuesday morning?",

Simon\nwas a conservative man, nothing was ever changed--not even the clerks,\nso I had the whole routine at my fingers. And he was an easy man to\nimitate too. That was where I scored again. I daresay I have inherited\nsome of the same tricks myself. I know I found them come quite easy--the\nstare and the silence and the grunts and the rest of them. And then I\nalways had more brains than Simon and could pick up business quicker. You should have heard me making that ass Malcolm Cromarty, and the\nFarmond girl, and this hangman with the glass eye tell me all about\nthemselves and what their business was, without their ever suspecting\nthey were being pumped! For, mind you, I'd never set eyes on Malcolm\nCromarty or the Farmond girl before in my life! No, it wasn't at the\noffice I had the nastiest time. It was burying the body that night.\" The boastful smile died off his lips and for a moment he shivered a\nlittle. \"What happened about that?\" enquired Carrington keenly. Rattar's voice instinctively fell a little. \"When I got home that afternoon I found he wasn't quite dead after all!\" \"That accounts for it!\" murmured Carrington. \"For what?\" \"Your maid heard him moving.\" The prisoner seemed to have recovered from his passing emotion. \"And I told her it was a rat, and she swallowed it!\" he laughed. \"Well,\nhe didn't move for long, and I had fixed up quite a good scheme for\ngetting him out of the house. A man was to call for old papers. I even\ndid two voices talking in the hall to make the bluff complete! Not being\nable to get his ring off his finger rather worried me, but I put that\nright by an advertisement in the paper saying I'd lost it!\" He was arrested by the look on Carrington's face. \"What happened?\" he exclaimed. \"Do you mean to say that gave me away?\" \"Those superfluous precautions generally give people away.\" \"But how?\" \"It doesn't matter now. You'll learn later. What next?\" \"Next?\" said Rattar. \"Well, I just went on keeping my head and bluffing\npeople----\" he broke off, looked at Superintendent Sutherland, and gave\na short laugh. \"I only lost my nerve a bit once, and that was when the\nglass-eyed hangman butted in and said he was going to get down a\ndetective. It struck me then it was time I was off--and what's more, I\nstarted!\" The superintendent's mouth fell open. \"You--you weren't the man----\" he began. \"Yes,\" scoffed the prisoner, \"I was the man with toothache in that\nempty carriage. I'd got in at the wrong side after the ticket collector\npassed and just about twenty seconds before you opened the door. But the\nsight of your red face made me change my plans, and I was out again\nbefore that train started! A bright policeman you are! After that I\ndecided to stick it out and face the music; and I faced it.\" His mouth shut tight and he sat back in his chair, his eyes travelling\nround the others as though to mark their unwilling admiration. He\ncertainly saw it in the faces of the two open-eyed policemen, but\nCromarty's was hard and set, and he seemed still to be waiting.",

Rattar looked at him defiantly. \"No evidence there,\" he said with a cunning shake of his head, \"you can\ngo on guessing!\" \"Would you like to smoke a pipe?\" asked Carrington suddenly. The man's eyes gleamed. \"By God, yes!\" \"You can have one if you tell us about Sir Reginald. We've got you\nanyhow, and there will be evidence enough there too when we've put it\ntogether.\" The superintendent looked a trifle shocked, but Carrington's sway over\nhim was by this time evidently unbounded. He coughed an official protest\nbut said nothing. The prisoner only hesitated for a moment. He saw Carrington taking out a\ncigarette, and then he took out his keys and said:\n\n\"This is the key for that drawer. You'll find my pipe and baccy there.

You know about it and about the letter Sir Reginald sent me\nafter I'd written. Well, when I got that letter I admit it rattled me a\nbit. I've often wondered since whether he had really suspected anything\nor whether he would have sooner or later. Anyhow I got it into my head\nthat the game was up if something didn't happen. And so it happened.\" \"You went and killed him?\" said Ned. \"That's for you and your glass eye to find out!\" snapped the prisoner. \"Take his pipe away,\" said Carrington quietly. \"Damn it!\" cried Rattar, \"I'll tell you, only I'm fed up with that man's\nbullying! I put it in a stocking\" (he nodded towards the match box)\n\"just as you guessed and I went out to Keldale that night. My God, what\na walk that was in the dark! I'd half forgotten the way down to the\nhouse and I thought every other tree was a man watching me. I don't know\nyet how I got to that library window. I remembered his ways and I\nthought he'd be sitting up there alone; but it was just a chance, and\nI'd no idea I'd have the luck to pick a night when he was sleeping in\nhis dressing room. Give me another drink!\" Carrington promptly brought one and again it vanished almost in a gulp. \"Well, I saw him through a gap in the curtains and I risked a tap on the\nglass. My God, how surprised he was to see me standing there! I grinned\nat him and he let me in, and then----\" He broke off and fell forward in\nhis chair with his face in his hands. \"This whisky has gone to my head!\" he muttered. \"You've mixed it too damned strong!\" Ned Cromarty sprang up, his face working.",

Why didn't you tell me more\nbefore I went in?\" \"For your own sake,\" said Carrington gently. \"The law is so devilish\nundiscriminating. Also, I wasn't absolutely certain then myself.\" They said nothing more till they were seated in Carrington's sitting\nroom and his employer had got a cigar between his teeth and pushed away\nan empty tumbler. \"I'm beginning to feel a bit better,\" said he. \"Fire away now and tell\nme how you managed this trick. I'd like to see just how derned stupid\nI've been!\" \"My dear fellow, I assure you you haven't! I'm a professional at this\ngame, and I tell you honestly it was at least as much good luck as good\nguidance that put me on to the truth at last.\" \"I wonder what you call luck,\" said Ned. \"Seems to me you were up\nagainst it all the time! You've told me how you caught Rattar lying at\nthe start. Well, that was pretty smart of you to begin with. Then, what\nnext? How did things come?\" \"Well,\" said Carrington, \"I picked up a little something on my first\nvisit to Keldale. From Bisset's description I gathered that the body\nmust have been dragged along the floor and left near the door. Why? Obviously as a blind. Adding that fact to the unfastened window, the\nbroken table, the mud on the floor, and the hearth brush, the odds\nseemed heavy on entry by the window. I also found that the middle blind\nhad been out of order that night and that it _might_ have been quite\npossible for any one outside to have seen Sir Reginald sitting in the\nroom and known he was alone there. Again, it seemed long odds on his\nhaving recognised the man outside and opened the window himself, which,\nagain, pointed to the man being some one he knew quite well and never\nsuspected mischief from.\" \"Those were always my own ideas, except that I felt bamboozled where you\nfelt clear--which shows the difference between our brains!\" Carrington laughed and shook his head. \"I wish I could think so! No, no, it's merely a case of every man to his\nown trade. And as a matter of fact I was left just as bamboozled as you\nwere. For who could this mysterious man be? Of the people inside the\nhouse, I had struck out Miss Farmond, Bisset, Lady Cromarty, and all the\nfemale servants. Only Sir Malcolm was left. I wired for him to come up\nand was able to score him out too. I also visited you and scored you\nout. So there I was--with no conceivable criminal!\" \"But you'd already begun to suspect Rattar, hadn't you?\"",

Of course if one didn't, it was\nplausible enough. When I first came down here it seemed to me a very\nlikely theory and I was prepared to find a guilty couple, but when I met\nMiss Farmond and told her suddenly that Sir Malcolm was arrested, and\nshe gazed blankly at me and asked 'What for?' well, I simply ran my\npencil, so to speak, through her name and there was an end of her! The\nsame with Sir Malcolm when I met him. And yet here was the family\nlawyer, who knew them both perfectly, so convinced of their guilt that\nhe was obviously stifling investigation in any other direction. And on\ntop of all that, all my natural instincts and intuitions told me that\nthe man was a bad hat.\" \"But didn't all that make you suspect him?\" \"Of what? Of leaving his respectable villa at the dead of night,\ntramping several miles at his age in the dark, and deliberately\nmurdering his own best client and old friend under circumstances so\nrisky to himself that only a combination of lucky chances saw him\nsafely through the adventure? Nothing--absolutely nothing but homicidal\nmania could possibly account for such a performance, and the man was\nobviously as sane as you or I. I felt certain that there was something\nwrong somewhere, but as for suspecting him of being the principal in the\ncrime, the idea was stark lunacy!\" \"By George, it was a tough proposition!\" said Ned. \"By the way, had you\nheard of George Rattar at that time?\" \"Oh, yes, I heard of him, and knew they resembled one another, but as I\nwas told that he had left the place for years and was now dead, my\nthoughts never even once ran in that direction until I got into a state\nof desperation, and then I merely surmised that his misdeeds might have\nbeen at the bottom of some difficulty between Simon and Sir Reginald.\" \"Then how on earth did you ever get on to the right track?\" \"I never would have if the man hadn't given himself away. To begin with,\nhe was fool enough to fall in with my perfectly genuine assumption that\nhe was either employing me or acting for my employer. No doubt he stood\nto score if the bluff had come off, and he banked on your stipulation\nthat your name shouldn't appear. But if he had only been honest in that\nmatter, my suspicions would never have started--not at that point\nanyhow.\" \"That was Providence--sure!\" said Ned with conviction. \"I'm inclined to think it was,\" agreed Carrington. \"Then again his\nadvice to Sir Malcolm and Miss Farmond was well enough designed to\nfurther his own scheme of throwing suspicion on them, but it simply\nended in his being bowled out both times, and throwing suspicion on\nhimself. But _the_ precaution which actually gave him away was putting\nin that advertisement about his ring.\" \"I was just wondering,\" said Ned, \"how that did the trick.\" \"By the merest fluke.",

That was when I collected\nthat extraordinary mixed bag of information which I was wondering\nyesterday whether to believe or not. Here are the items, and you can\njudge for yourself what my state of mind was when I was carrying about\nthe following precious pieces of information.\" He ticked the items off on his fingers. \"A mysterious man who entered the garden one night and left his\nfootprints in the gravel, and whose visit had a strange and mysterious\neffect on Rattar. Funny feelings produced in the bosom of the housemaid\nby the presence of her master. Doors of unused rooms mysteriously locked\nand keys taken away; said to be old papers inside. Mysterious visit of\nmysterious man at dead of night to remove the said papers. A ring that\ncouldn't come off the owner's finger mysteriously lost. Mysterious\nburglary on night of the murder by mysterious burglar who left all\nwindows and doors locked behind him and took nothing away. Mysterious\nperambulations of his garden every night at nine o'clock by Mr. Simon\nRattar.\" \"Great Scot!\" murmured Cromarty. \"I have given you the items in what turned out to be their order of\ndate, but I got them higgledy-piggledy and served up in a sauce of\nmystery and trembly sensations that left me utterly flummoxed as to how\nmuch--if anything--was sober fact. However, I began by fastening on to\ntwo things. The first was the burglary, which of course at once\nsuggested the possibility that the man who had committed the crime at\nKeldale had returned to Rattar's house and got in by that window. The\nsecond was the nightly perambulations, which could easily be tested. When Mr. Rattar emerged at nine that night, I was in the garden before\nhim. And what do you think he did?\" \"Had a look at his brother's grave?\" \"Smoked two pipes of tobacco! A man who was an anti-tobacco fanatic! The\ntruth hit me straight in the eye--'That man is not Simon Rattar!' And\nthen of course everything dropped into its place. The ex-convict twin\nbrother, the only evidence of whose supposititious death was an\nannouncement in the paper, obviously put in as a blind. The personal\nresemblance between the two. All the yarns told me by the housemaid,\nincluding the strange visitor--George of course arriving; the man who\ncame for the papers--George himself taking out the body; and the\nvanished ring. Everything fitted in now, and the correspondence between\nSir Reginald and Rattar which had beaten me before, gave the clue at\nonce as to motive.\" \"I guess you felt you had deserved a drink that trip!\" said Ned. \"I didn't stop to have my drink.

Rattar, it seemed, kept an old pair of kid\ngloves in his desk which he was in the habit of wearing when he was\nalone in the office.\" \"Don't quite see the bearing of that.\" \"Well, on my hypothesis it was to avoid leaving finger marks. You see\nGeorge was an ex-convict. It was a very judicious precaution too, and\nmade it extremely difficult to catch him out by that means, for one\ncould scarcely approach a respectable solicitor and ask him for an\nimpression of his fingers! And anyhow, nothing could be definitely\nproved against him until we had found Simon's body. That was the next\nproblem. Where had he hidden it?\" \"And how did you get at that?\" \"Guessed it. At first my thoughts went too far afield, but when I went\nover the times mentioned in the maid's story of the man who took away\nthe papers, and the fact that she heard no sound of a wheeled vehicle, I\nrealised that he must have simply planted it in one of the flower beds.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws. The Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support. Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.",
