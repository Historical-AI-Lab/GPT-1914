But then what is it that a young and devoted husband will not do for his wife? Moreover, the more distressing of the two demands had to be met first. Lord Willowby told him that his partners in that scheme of cheating the jobbers had resolved to meet on the first of the new year to consider what was to be done; so that in the mean time Balfour could allow his conscience to rest, so far as the money was concerned. But in the mean time came Christmas; and he told his wife that he had no objection to joining that family party at the Hall. When he said that he had no objection, he meant that he had about twenty dozen, which he would overrule for her sake. And indeed Lady Sylvia's delight at his consent was beautiful to see. She spent day after day in decorating Willowby Hall with evergreens; she did not altogether neglect The Lilacs, but then, you see, there was to be no Christmas party there. She sung at her work; she was as busy as she could be; she even wished-in the fulness of her heartthat her cousin Honoria were already arrived to help her. And\nCHRISTMAS SENTIMENT. 175 \n\nBalfour?

This, he considered, was not in the bond. He had managed to make the acquaintance of a certain clergyman in the neighborhood of Englebury; and this worthy person had just forwarded him the proof-sheets of an essay on some public question or other, with a meek request that Mr. Balfour would glance over it and say whether the case of the enemy had been fairly and fully stated. This was courageous and honest on the part of the parson, for Mr. Balfour was on the side of the enemy.

What, then, was this big, busy town through which we drove, with its broad thoroughfares, deep dust, green trees, and huge hotels? We looked at the jewellers' shops, and the cafés, and the promenaders, and one cries out, \"Baden-Baden !”\n\nWe catch a glimpse of some public gardens and colored lamps. and avenues, and another calls out, \"It is Kreuznach, and the band is playing!\" 1\nOUR RANCH-WOMAN. 233 \n\nWe whirl along another spacious thoroughfare, and a third calls out, \"It is the Boulevard Poissonnière !\" when it is mildly suggested that, after all, this may be no more Kreuznach than the Hudson was the Rhine, and that it might be better, on the whole, to call it Saratoga. It was with great diffidence that we ascended the steps of the monster hotel, and found ourselves in a large central hall. We were conscious that we were travel-stained, and had scarcely sufficient moral courage to ask the clerk for rooms. We knew that the smart young men standing around were regarding us; and oh! so snowy were their white neckties, which they wore in the middle of the day. And then, to make matters worse, this pernicious ranch-woman had donned in the morning a costume of lightblue serge, in which she had done some yachting the year before; and we knew, though we dared not look, that there must be stains of the salt-sea foam on it. Finally, our inward rage and humiliation were complete when, having been furnished with our keys, we entered the lift to be conveyed to the floors above; for here we found ourselves confronted by three young ladies-but the human imagination refuses to recall the splendor of the attire of these angels in human form. Each of them had a jeweller's shop on her hands. However, we dried our eyes in secret, and made as brave an appearance as possible when we assembled together in the saloon below. \"Look here, child,\" said Queen T— to our ranch-woman, as she lifted a white object from the table. \"Do you see that? That is a fork. You take it in your left hand, and you lift your food to your mouth with it, instead of with your fingers, as you have been accustomed.\" \"It's a thorough good lickin' you want,\" said this child of nature, doggedly. It was all we could get out of her. Then we went out for a drive; and a mighty fine show we made, with our green gauze curtains to keep out the dust, and with our two horses. The lieutenant was perched up beside the driver. Occasionally he disappeared from our sight altogether, hidden away by the dense clouds of brown dust that came rolling in the wake of some carriage. And the farther we went out into the country, the deeper the dust in the roads appeared to become, until our German friend had assumed the guise of a baker, and\nthere was scarcely any difference between the color of his hat, his beard, and his coat."}

It was a song of love he sung-of love and youth and the delight of summer nights: how could they but stand still to hear? A LIFE-PLEDGE. 43 \n\nCHAPTER VI. A LIFE-PLEDGE. LORD WILLOWBY had fallen asleep. Through the white curtains of the window they could see him lying back in an easychair, a newspaper dropped on his knee. Why should they go in to wake him? The wan light was dying away from the bosom of the lake down there, and there was less of a glow in the northern skies; but the stars were burning more clearly now-white and throbbing over the black foliage of the elms. The nightingale sung from time to time, and the woods were silent to hear. Now and again a cool breeze came through the bushes, bringing with it a scent of lilacs and sweetbrier. They were in no hurry to re-enter the house. Balfour was talking a little more honestly and earnestly now; for he had begun to speak of his work, his aims, his hopes, his difficulties. It was not a romantic tale he had to tell on this beautiful night, but his companion conferred romance upon it. He was talking as an eager, busy, practical politician; she believed she was listening to a great statesman, to a leader of the future, to her country's one and only savior. It was of no use that he insisted on the prosaic and commonplace nature of the actual work he had to do. \"You see, Lady Sylvia,\" he said, \"I am only an apprentice as yet. I am only learning how to use my tools. And the fact is, there is not one man in fifty in the House who fancies that any tools are necessary. Look how on the most familiar subjectsthose nearest to their own doors—they are content to take all their information from the newspapers. They never think of inquiring, of seeing, for themselves. They work out legislation as a mere theorem; they have no idea how it is practically applied.

Now I have been trying to\ncram on some of these things, but I have avoided official reports.

Next week I am going to spend in a worse den—a haunt of thieves, tramps, and hawkers; a very pretty den, indeed, to be the property of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and almost under the shadow of Westminster Abbey !\" She uttered a slight exclamation-of deprecation and anxious fear.

But if you walk over, you must send Lock to the cottage with the horses, and ride back.\" Although they were profoundly disappointed that Lord Willowby could not accompany them, they set out on their walk with an assumed cheerfulness which seemed to conceal their inward grief. It was July now; but the morning was fresh and cool after the night's rain, and there was a pleasant southerly breeze blowing the fleecy clouds across the blue sky, so that there was an abundance of light, motion, and color all around them. The elms were rustling and swaying in the park; the rooks were cawing; in the distance they saw a cloud of yellow smoke arise from the road as the fresh breeze blew across. She led him away by secret paths and wooded lanes, with here and there a stile to cross, and here and there a swinging gate to open. She was anxious he should know intimately all the surroundings of his future home, and she seemed to be familiar with the name of every farm-house, every turnpike, every clump of trees, in the neighborhood. She knew the various plants in the hedges, and he professed himself profoundly interested in learning their names. They crossed a bit of common now; he had never known before how beautiful the flowers of a common were -the pale lemon-colored hawk-weed, the purple thyme, the orange and crimson tipped bird's-foot trefoil. They passed through waving fields of rye; he had never noticed before the curious sheen of gray produced by the wind on those billows of green. They came in sight of long undulations of wheat; he ved he had never seen in his life anything so beautiful as the brilliant scarlet of the poppies where the corn was scant. The happiness in Lady Sylvia's face, when he expressed himself delighted with all these things, was something to sec. They came upon a gypsy encampment, apparently deserted by all but the women and children. One of the younger women immediately came out and began the usual patter. Would not the pretty lady have her fortune told? She had many happy days in store for her, but she had a little temper of her own, and so forth. Lady Sylvia stood irresolute, bashful, rather inclined to submit to the ordeal for the amusement of the thing, and looking doubtfully at her companion as to whether he would approve. As for Balfour, he did not pay the slightest heed to the poor woman's jargon. His eye had been wandering over the encampment, apparently examining everything. And then he turned to the woman, and began to question her with a directness that startled her out of her trade manner altogether."}

Then this Surrey Sardanapalus, having surrounded himself with all the sham gorgeousness he could think of, proceeded to put an end to himself by means of brandyand-soda. He effected his purpose in a short time; and that is all that need here be said of him. It was a pitiable sight enough-this great, castellated, beplastered, ostentatious house, that had a certain gloom and isolation about it, handed over to the occupancy of a cheerfully inquisi-\nTHE COLLAPSE. 281 tive crowd, who showed no hesitation at all in fingering over the dead man's trinkets, and opening his desks and cabinets. His very clothes were hanging up there, in a ghastly row, each article numbered off as a lot. In the room in which he had but recently died, a fine, tall, fresh-colored farmer-dressed for the occasion in broadcloth-was discussing with his wife what price the bedstead would probably fetch. And there was a bar, with sherry and sandwiches. And on the lawn outside the auctioneer had put up his tent; and the flag erected over the tent was of the gayest colors. Lord Willowby and Balfour strolled through these rooms, both forbearing to say what they thought of all this tawdry magnificence-panellings of blue silk and silver, with a carpet of pink roses on a green ground; candelabra, costing £1800, the auctioneer's reserve price on which was £300; improvised ancestors, at a guinea a head, looking out of gorgeous frames; and so forth, and so forth. They glanced at the catalogue occasionally. It was an imposing volume; and the descriptions of the contents of the house were almost poetical. \"Look at the wines,\" said Lord Willowby, with a compassionate smile. \"The claret is nearly all Lafitte. I suppose those toadies of his have supplied him with a vin ordinaire at 120 shillings a dozen.\" \"I should not be surprised if a lot of these spurious things sold for more than he gave for them,\" Balfour said. \"You will find people imagining everything to be fine because a rich man bought it. That claret would fetch a high price, depend on it, if it was all labelled 'Château Wandsworth.' 999 Then there was the ringing of a bell; and the people began to stream out of the house into the marquee; and the auctioneer had an improvised rostrum put up for himself at the end of the long table; and then the bare-armed men began to carry out the various articles to be bid for. It was soon very evident that prices were running high. No doubt the farmers about would be proud to show to their friends a despatch-box, a bird-cage, a hall table-anything that had belonged to the owner of The Hollow. And so the ostentatious trash, that even Tottenham Court \n\nRoad would have been ashamed of, was carried piecemeal out into the light of the day; and in some instances these simple folk considered it to be so beautiful that a murmur of admira-\ntion ran round the tent when the things were brought in. It was altogether a melancholy sight. Balfour had accompanied Lord Willowby solely from the fact of his having an idle forenoon to dispose of; but he could not quite make out what his father-in-law's purpose was in coming here. For one thing, he appeared to be quite indifferent about the sale itself. He had listened to one or two of the biddings; and then-saying that the prices were ridiculously high-had proposed a farther stroll through the rooms. So they entered the house again, and had another look at the old masters (dating from the latter half of the nineteenth century) and at the trumpery gilt and satin. 66 \"Ah, well, Balfour,\" said Lord Willowby, with a pensive air, one can almost pity that poor fellow, having his house overhauled by strangers in this way. Fortunately he knows nothing about it."}

Gentlemen, good-morning. Eugenius, the chaise is at the door.\" With that she walked in a stately manner out of the room, leaving the burden of the situation on her unfortunate husband. He looked rather bewildered; but nevertheless he felt bound to assert the dignity of the family. \"I must say, Mr. Balfour,\" said he, rather nervously, \"that your language is-is unusual. Mrs. Chorley only asked for—for an expression of regret an apology which was only our due after the remarks of-of Lady Sylvia.\" By this time Balfour had got on his feet, and taken his hat in his hand. All the Celtic blood in his veins was on fire. 66 \"An apology!\" he said. 'Why, man, you must be mad! I tell you that every word my wife said was absolutely true. Do you expect her to send you a humble letter, begging for your forgiveness? I apologized for her hastiness at the time; I am sorry I did.

Good-morning, Mr. Chorley. Pray tell Mrs. Chorley that I am very sorry if I have hurt her feelings; but pray tell her too that my wife is not conscious of having said anything that demands an apology.\" And so this mad young man and his companion went out, and walked down the main street of Englebury in the pleasant sunshine. And it was all in vain that Mr. Bolitho tried to put in his piteous prayers and remonstrances. The borough? He would see the borough sink into the bottomless pit before he would allow his wife to apologize for a speech that did her infinite honor! The election? He would fight the place if there were ten thousand Chorleys arrayed against him! \"I tell you you have gone stark staring mad,\" said the despairing Mr. Bolitho. \"Chorley will immediately go over to \n\nHarnden-you will see. His wife will goad him to it. And how can you think of contesting the seat against Harnden and \n\nChorley combined?\" Nature had not conferred a firm jaw on Mr. Hugh Balfour for nothing. \"I tell you, in turn,\" said the young man, who was neither to hold nor to bind, simply because something had been said about his wife-\"I tell you, in turn, that I mean to contest the seat all the same; and, what is more, by the Lord Harry, I mean to win it!\" CHAPTER XX. AT A CERTAIN CLUB. \"BOLITHO,\" said Mr. Hugh Balfour, as the two companions were preparing to leave for the London train, “when you see my wife, don't say anything to her about this affair. She would only be annoyed to think that she was in any way connected\nwith such a wretched wrangle. Women are better out of these things.\" Now, Mr. Bolitho was somewhat vexed. The guiding principle in life of this bland, elderly, easy-going gentleman was to make friends everywhere, or, at least, acquaintances, so that you could scarcely have mentioned to him a borough in England in which he did not know, more or less slightly, some man of influence. And here he had been involved in a quarrel—all because of the impetuous temper of this foolish young man — - with the ruling politician of Englebury! “I don't think,\" said he, with a wry smile, \"that I am likely to see Lady Sylvia.\" : \"What do you mean?\" Balfour asked, as they set out to walk to the station."}

But when Lady Sylvia went on to explain, with increasing hesitation, that herself and her husband would be expected to be of this Christmas gathering, Mr. Balfour mentally made use of a phrase which was highly improper. She did not hear it, of course. They drove up to the Hall in silence; and when they got into the house, Balfour shook hands with Major \n\nBlythe with all apparent good-nature. Lord Willowby had wished the stranger to follow him into the library. In a few moments he returned to the drawingroom. He was obviously greatly disturbed. \"You must excuse me, Sylvia; I cannot possibly go over with you to lunch. I have some business which will detain me half an hour at least—perhaps more. But your uncle and aunt can go with you.\" That was the first Balfour had heard of Major Blythe and his wife having been invited to lunch at his house; but had he not sworn to be grandly considerate? He said nothing. Lady Sylvia turned to her two relatives. Now, had Lord Willowby been going over to The Lilacs, his brother might have ventured to accompany him; but Major Blythe scarcely liked the notion of thrusting his head into that lion's den all by himself. \"My dear,\" said the doughty warrior to his wife, \"I think we will leave the young folks to themselves for to-day-if they will kindly excuse us.

We each of us can get on pretty well without the other.\" \"But it is dreadful to have members of one family in-in position of antagonism or dislike to each other,\" she ventured to say, with her heart beating a trifle more rapidly. \"Well, yes,\" he said, cheerfully. \"I suppose Major Blythe and I are members of the same family, as we are all descended from Adam. If that is what you mean, I admit the relationship; but not otherwise. Come, Sylvia, let's talk about something else. Have you seen the Von Rosens lately?\" For an instant she hesitated, eager, disappointed, and wistful; but she pulled her courage together, and answered with seeming good-will. \"Oh yes,\" she said. \"Mr. Von Rosen called yesterday. And the strangest thing has happened. An uncle of his wife has just died in some distant place in America, and has left a large amount of property to Mrs. Von Rosen, on condition she goes out there some time next year, and remains for a year at the house that has been left her. And she is not to take her children with her. Mrs. Von Rosen declares she won't go. She won't leave her children for a whole year. They want her to go and live in some desert place just below the Rocky Mountains.' \"A desert!\" he cried. \"Why, don't you know that the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains has been my ideal harbor of refuge whenever I thought of the two worst chances that can befall one?"}
