That's the very way the girl came to capture him; an' that's the very way he left these parts and went off on his travels to Dublin. But sure ye know; an' now come away out, Frank, till I show ye the fields. Get the tay, Sarah; an' call us when it's ready.\" Frank followed John through the garden, out into the lane, and thence uphill till they came to a circular mound towards which from all sides the island sloped up from the water. This was the highest point of Inishrath; and standing there, Frank had full sight of it all, and of the lake stretching away from its stony shores. In shape it was nearly circular. Round its edge, here and there, were trees. Hedges ran down and across it, and from ditch to ditch lay the bare ribs of the little fields. The soil showed cold and hungry through its covering of stones and coarse grass. Here, two goats were hobbling along, there, a donkey stood forlorn among the whins, in and out of the rush clumps ran scrags of fowls. Half way down, stood the Butlers' home-tumble-down offices behind, garden in front, the pier and cots below. The wind came shrill and keen; the sky hung low; bleak and barren, Inishrath lay scowling in the waste of grey waters. John stretched an arm and swept it around. \"There,\" said he; \"there's me estate.\" THE BARRYS. Frank looked right and left, here and there. Yes, thought he; and an estate to be proud of. 66 \"The whole island, then, belongs to you, John?\" \"Such as it is, I own it all-for a consideration in the shape of rent,\" added John, with a grin. Frank nodded. \"And yours is the only house upon it, I see?\" \"That's all. One house an' one estate, an' all me own.\" Again Frank nodded."}

Within ten minutes he had affirmed that free-trade was ruining England; that popular education was a mistake; that coals were absurdly dear, and that baldness was hereditary in the Dent family. His opinions were antiquated. He believed in the past, the good old days of his youth, the time when apples were six a penny, and Dulwich was a garden of Eden, and boys were boys, and girls girls, and neither spoilt by the Board Schools. Mentally he had not budged for forty years; in knowledge and experience he was a young man grown old, a fossil embedded in the dear hills of long ago. In literature he admired Dickens, Shakespeare (whom he never read), and the evening paper. In art he was fond of battle-pieces, studies in the pathetic, colour broad and garish. Give him music that set his heels drumming, ballads that wailed and snivelled, and he was happy. He was easily pleased; fond of his home; unselfish, good-tempered; and for the rest, spoke never an evil word of anyone. In all his life, by word or deed, he had never wronged a soul. His record was clean before God and man. Yet, in face of these benevolences, perhaps indeed because of them, there at sixty-five stood Richard Dent, still at the foot of the ladder, his face turned hopefully upwards, ever striving, ever failing, doomed for aye to see others climbing and himself left trampling the dust, a commercial drudge, a stranded, grey-headed junior.

Come, Nan, me girl; come away, Sarah. Ye'll forgive us runnin' off, Frank, me son? But the poor must earn their bread be the sweat o' their brow. Ay, ay.\" So the feast broke up.

The night began to fall; the waters lapped against the cot and splashed musically at dip of the oars; but, all the way from Inishrath to the \n\nLismahee side and thence (the cot now full of noisy marketers, some tipsy, some sober, many striking the golden mean) to Garvagh, the only music that sounded for Frank Barry was the soft witchery of Nan's voice, and the only night that fell flashed from Nan's dark eyes; nor did he once, all the way, call to mind the eyes and voice of his dear Maid \n\nMarian. Ah, Frank Barry! Then the cot swung to the pier; out poured the marketers with shout and clamour. Soon Frank was standing in shade of the willows, and Nan was gone, and John's voice was ringing out across the dark waters: \"Good night, Mr. Frank. Safe home; an' come again soon.\" 1\nCHAPTER V. \n\nTwo nights went; it was only the afternoon of \n\nMonday, yet once again was Frank Barry feeling somewhat restive. He felt inclined to mope, to grumble. The days were long, the nights weary; life, he felt, ran tamely within the precincts of Ryfield. It seemed quite a week, for instance, since Saturday and his visit to Inishrath; it seemed eighteen hours rather than eight since the coming of Marian's letter by that morning's post. Not that he was pining to get back to Inishrath. Oh, no. Not that Marian's letter had brought depression or loneliness. Oh, no, indeed. Nevertheless, time did seem to hang on his hands; he did feel bored and weary. How was it? Was his environment to be blamed; that, or himself? His environment surely. Think of the last two days. Think of Sunday; its late breakfast, its weary drive through the fields and bogs to the dreary church with its box-pews, harmonium, drawling choir, prosy sermon."}

He flung back his chair, fell to pacing up and down, hands writhing behind him, chin on his breast. It was infernal, he kept repeating to himself. He had so much to do; time was pressing hard. He tried again; failed; rose and threw his pen upon the carpet. \"Oh, confound the thing,\" he cried. \"And confound the woman!\" he cried again; and there laid naked the writhing maggot of his discontent."}

CHAPTER VI. To Frank Barry it was pleasant relief, that quick stepping from the stuffy hall into the light and freshness even of East Street. There was a snap in the air, a bracing coolness, as of the sea in summer time. He felt exhilarated, well satisfied; he drew a long breath, lighted a cigarette, and, standing by the curb, looked up at the sky. It was full of stars; as his eyes found them, Frank told himself that he had managed Sarah well. Ah, but she was deep! But not deep enough. Frank Barry saw through her little scheme. Right glad she would be for Mr. \n\nFrank to come visiting-when John was at home. Very anxious she was now for Nan to see Mr. Frank. Nan? Why had she refused? Was it because of the old days, the old happenings? What was she doing, thinking, even then? Turning, he looked up-back went Sarah's face from one window; a corner of the blind dropped behind the other; below, the barearmed landlady shrank quickly into the gloom of her shop. It was time to move, Frank thought. He took to the roadway, and set out for home. The street was now all bustle and glare, the pavements thronged, the air quick with clamour. Girls were singing, women shrilling, men laughing, shouting. There 275\nTHE BARRYS. were children everywhere; playing, fighting, squalling, carrying beer jugs, bottles of paraffin, dabs of butter on plates, penn'orths of treacle in cups."}

Somehow, he felt nervous, apprehensive. Beneath the hall lamp, he stopped and pulled out his watch. Past nine o'clock; nearly supper-time. A woman; a nameless woman? Slowly he walked to the dining-room door; there stopped again, with his 237\nTHE BARRYS. hand on the knob; then quickly turned the handle and went in. The gas was turned high; the table laid for supper. Facing the door a small fire burnt brightly; and by it, on the edge of a chair, sat a woman in a black bonnet and shawl. Frank crossed; the woman turned; \n\nFrank stopped. It was Sarah Butler. There came to Frank Barry, as he stood there dumfounded between the table and the sideboard, a vivid memory of something he had seen nearly three years before-a cottage wall, a window below the thatch, a face above the sill, a sneering face set round with a frilled night-cap; and with the memory came to him also a numb feeling of dismay. Sarah Butler? Nan's mother? Why had she come? He plucked at his collar-band; moved a step; halted, and stood looking at the fire. Sarah rose. \"Good-evenin', Mr. Barry,\" said she. \"I hope I'm seein' ye well?”\n\nIt was the old voice, the old shrill voice; and to \n\nFrank's ears it came like an echo from the buried past. He turned; quickly put out his hand, as quickly withdrew it, and laid it on the back of a chair. 66 \n\nGood-evening, Mrs. Butler,\" he answered. \"Goodevening.\" He paused; rubbed his hand backwards and forwards along the chair-back; looked round. \"Won't you sit down?\" said he. Behind her hand Sarah coughed; drew out a rag of pocket-handkerchief, wiped her lips, and once more seated herself on the edge of a chair. Her eyes shifted quickly here and there; presently fixed themselves on Frank's face.

He turned a chair; sat down, set his elbow on the table and his cheek on his hand. \"Yes,\" he said; \"yes, indeed.\" Sarah coughed again; ran a finger between chin and bonnet string, shifted back an inch in her chair. \"Ye didn't expect to see me here, Mr. Barry,\" she ventured, part asserting, part questioning. Frank looked at her. 66 \n\nNo,\" he said. \"Frankly, I did not.\" 66 \n\nAy. Just so. It'll be a good while since we seen other last, Mr. Barry,\" Sarah went on after a pause. Frank nodded. \"A long time it is; three years a'most. Ay, nearly three years.\" Sarah sighed. \"An' sure a power can happen in three years; ay, a power.\" Still Frank sat silent. Why had she come? he kept thinking. How did she find out? He turned his eyes; met Sarah's full; hastily looked away. \"Yes. Oh, yes. How-how's John, Mrs. Butler?\" \"John? Aw, John's the best, so he is-what's left of him.

John went on with his rigmarole. Frank leant back in his chair, hooked his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat; with the tail of his eye fell to observing the methods of rustic lovers. Close together, almost elbow to elbow, they sat; yet of each other's presence seemed to take no heed. As wooden as a graven image, Ted sat sucking at his pipe. Like patience on a monument (the simile is Frank's own), Nan sat staring at the pothooks. Surely they must have quarrelled? thought Frank. Surely this Ross was a very boor. He took good stock of him. A muscular young fellow he seemed; broad of shoulder, thick of neck, big of limb. His face was strong and well moulded; his brown hair curled closely; his skin shone healthily. He was dressed in rough tweed, leggings, a peaked cap and hobnailed boots. No Adonis, thought Frank, decidedly no gentleman; still, and Frank glanced at Nan, no denying that physically they were a well-matched pair.

Frank raised his brows, smiled to himself; then stretched his legs towards the blaze and gave full ear to John's discourse. Hitherto John had been talking disjointedly, halfheartedly; now, at sight of Frank giving him full heed, quickly he found himself, stretched forth a hand and gave his tongue the reins. The subject was Ireland (that everlasting subject), and the land question (that eternal question); vehemently John grappled with it. Ah, he knew a thing or two. Hadn't he eyes? What were politicians but a tribe of bagpipes? What was Government but an old woman? What was Ireland but a home of lost causes? and John rolled the phrase, picked, doubtless, in some chance garden of editorial wisdom, about his tongue. What were its people but beggars, outcasts, hewers of wood and drawers of water? Who would save Ireland, sir? shouted John, shooting forth a finger. Would England, sir? Would politicians, sir? Would God save Ireland? shouted \n\nJohn again. No, sir. But this is what would save her, and John's voice sank solemnly: Herself, sir, and her own true sons. Frank sat listening to this, and to ever so much more, with enjoyment. It was all so novel, so whimsical. The scene, the moment, appealed to him. He liked this windbag of a John, liked to watch his moon-red face, his flaming eyes, darting hands; liked to hear his voice, so mellow and big and richly twanged with the loughside brogue.

He could quote you leading articles, Latin quotations and all, by the yard. He could recite whole pages from Bunyan, and long chapters from the Book of Proverbs or the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Con stantly in his discourse was some chance line, garnered in heaven knows what corner of the mighty\n\nPress, of the poets in evidence. He knew much of \n\nPope by heart."}

I got as near as I dared, and kept eye and ear open. John was marvellous. Really he has missed his vocation-or found it. His face shone with the light and fervour of inspiration. His gestures were regal. Never on the stage have I seen the emotions play finer havoc with the human countenance. The thunder of indignation, the flash of scorn, the withering whisper of sarcasm, the supercilious taunt, the enlivening jest: one after another, you had them hot and breathless from that wondrous tongue. Really the man has gifts. Not to one in a million is given his astonishing talent of speech. I could imagine him-educated, trained-a second Grattan, a greater O'Connell. And\nLONDON. 385 there he stood, thumping the democratic tub in Hyde Park, rending the firmament with screed and brogue! Well, he is happy, I suppose; happier than most. I must see him again. Not now. I'm not in the humour for diversion. I'm waiting for-for something. July 21. I have been to Camberwell. Here is what I found: Dear Frank-Thank you for the money. I am most careful, and am keeping a strict account. Yes; it is quite sufficient. The boy is well. Marian. That is all! That is the answer to all my longing, and hoping, and waiting-that! So does she show how she feels for me!"}

Went to a literary dinner last evening. Enjoyed it. Have a head to-day, though. I can see clearly that for men to get on they must show themselves. I made heaps of friends last night: big men, men I should have known long ago. That's the worst of married life; it buries you. September 15. Had lunch to-day with a great critic. I think we got on well together. He may be useful some day. The novel drags slightly; think I'll give it a rest. Just off for an hour to the club. September 17. To-day being Sunday, I went out\nTHE BARRYS. to hear friend John's democratic sermon. It was immense. The amount of Atheism, Jacobitism, Radicalism, Ruffianism, and all the rest, he has managed to soak up from Walworth pewter pots is amazing; and there stood the fools agape whilst he squeezed himself upon them!... After a while, who should come up but Ted and Nan. It was a funny meeting. Ted was awkward at first; Nan blushed charmingly, but held herself well. They had come to thank me, said they, for what I had done for them. They? said I; then it was true that affairs had prospered? \"Aw, yes,\" said Ted, looking at his boots; \"we've come to an understandin' at last.\" \"At last,\" repeated I, looking at Nan. \"Yes,\" said she, and met my eyes fearlessly; \"at last, Mr. Barry.\" I laughed and changed the subject. They are a well-matched pair. God bless them, as their compatriots do say. They proffered their thanks without stint. I received them with a wave of my hand; and looking again at Nan, asked myself for what had I not to thank her? For a great deal, it seemed to me. Still, I make no reproach. I am chief sinner against myself. Nan was simply the instrument of my friend the Piper. She looked very charming, I thought. Does she love Ted? Does she love him as somebody once taught her to love? I can answer with confidence. . . . Let that all go. I'm a hardened, dusty, old fossil now. Just before they went, said Nan: \"You're often in these parts, Mr. Barry?\" \"Yes,\" said I. \"Have ye flitted from Camberwell, then?\" she asked, and looked keenly at me. \"As butterflies flit,\" answered \n\nI, with a laugh. But she looked dubious. . . . A ...\nLONDON. 397 while ago, Nan could have helped me; a while ago, I should have welcomed her help; now, it only occurs to me. I am indifferent. Why is it? Has the frost of cynicism set in? Or is it only the reaction? . . . Must end now. Just off to a fellow's diggings. Smoke, talk, grog; cards maybe, after twelve. Such is life nowadays. September 25. The entries in this Journal grow sparse, I notice. I have little to enter, and less time than of yore. Somehow, I'm always out of evenings. Life goes with me now. Old Omar, or somebody, was right: the Sapients make of the world only an inn where they tarry for a while. And a mighty cosy inn, too, when the lamps are ablaze. Eh, father mine? What are you thinking up there, so silent and calm? September 28. How is it the old days seem so remote? I look back on three months ago as through the large end of a telescope. Time seems to have raised a mound upon them. I wonder how Marian is feeling? Is the small end of her glass towards me also? ... Ah, when that day comes, if ever it comes now, won't she find me changed indeed!"}

The time for these things is past. You have said your say; I mine. You have your view of things; I mine. You have decided on a course of action, and are taking it; I also have now decided-not impulsively, you understand, not without patient deliberation-on my course of action, and am going to take it. 371\nTHE BARRYS. \"You have asked for time in which to regain the trust and love which I, through my misdeeds-misdeeds wilfully distorted and magnified, be it saidhave caused you to lose. You prefer to remain with your mother rather than give me the chance to aid you in your quest, rather than to do what some people-not I, remember-might call your duty to child and husband. However, let that pass. All I wish now to say to you is, what I said to you verbally this evening, that you will please me by pleasing yourself, and will do what you consider right in your own way and at your leisure. You are quite free. Far be it from me to dictate or advise. As I said, stay just as long as you like. Do not consider me at all.

Terrible bad luck. I lost last night -I'm afraid to reckon how much. This must not go on. Why, I haven't a pound to send to Marian. Shameful, oh shameful, Frank Barry! Next thing \n\nI'll be stealing from the boy's fund. Never-never! October 18. Have changed my apartments again. Am now vegetating in one room in Bedford Street. It's nearer the seat of war.

Naturally of a jealous disposition, quick in temper too, and, when roused, hot of heart and tongue, very decided also in her opinions, and something of the Puritan in her outlook on the broad domains of right and wrong, Marian was not of those who suffer wrong gladly or hide trouble within the gates of silence; most certainly was she not the woman to take lightly wrongs such as those of Frank's and give them quick forgiveness.

Hurriedly she ran down the lane, pushed out the cot and started for Garvagh. He might come, her heart sang in time with the oars; he might come. Who knows? Vigorously, with something of her old gladness of heart, she swung to and fro on the thwart. He might. He might, she murmured. The cot neared the shore. She dared not look. He might. He might, she said. The cot swung round. She lifted her eyes and there stood old Hugh Barry. The gladness died in \n\nNan's heart. Old Hugh, thought she; not Frank, but his grim old uncle. The cot ran up on the landing-place; without a word, Hugh stepped in and stiffly sat down. His face looked mighty hard, Nan thought, mighty hard and cold. She rowed a stroke or two; then, with an effort: \"It'll be fine weather, Mr. Barry?\" said she, looking at her hands. \"It is, thank God,\" answered Hugh. \"It's the best o' weather.\" \"Ye'll be for the Lismahee side, Mr. Barry?\" \"For Inishrath, I'll thank ye.\" Hugh pointed at the island with his staff. \"Inishrath, I'll thank ye.\" Nan looked swiftly at him.

Ay, faith, thought he; ay, faith. So this was the jade who was making a fool of Frank. Just so. She had grown a trifle these last few years; she seemed a strong, well-boned wench; he supposed she had her share of good looks? Yes, she had. She was the kind of damsel Frank's father used to look twice at. She had good eyes in her. She had a good face. He liked the way her hair-Phat! One would think he was Frank! Fiercely, Hugh smote the gunwale with his staff and looked away. Nan rowed on; presently, old Hugh looked at her again.

At once the room was filled with chatter, greetings, laughter; soon fell quiet again as the door closed upon Marian and her mother and the three men were left to themselves.

Not one of his white hairs was awry; his whiskers were perfection; the parting that ran from nape to crown was mathematical in its correctness.

From top to toe he looked the pink of cleanliness, decency; a fine specimen of your average, middleclass Englishman, insular, it might be, and not intellectually endowed, yet standing upright in his square-toed shoes. For a while he stood warming his hands and uttering this truism and that, about the weather, the stalest politics, the latest news; then turned, tucked hands under coat-tails and swayed forward on his toes. \"Well, Frank, my boy,\" said he, and strove to hide the twinkle in his eyes; \"what's your opinion, now, of things in general?\" Frank had been confidently awaiting that. It was the Dad's great joke; one that had seen service on a thousand hearthrugs. He laughed, winked across at Rab; answered the \n\nDad as always, in the like case, he had answered, by offering him pipe and tobacco. \"Smoke, Dad,\" said he. \"Do now. Come, be sociable.\" The Dad chuckled and looked slyly at Frank. 66 “Ah, you rascal,\" said he, and repeated himself for the thousandth time. \"You murderin' villain; an' is it carried home on a stretcher you'd have me.\" He turned to Rab and began fumbling in his tail pocket. \"You know, Mr. Lindsay,\" he went on, with that air of jauntiness which, in his moments of humour, he usually affected, \"these young rascals of Irishmen want careful watching.

Low on a stool, Sarah sat rounding the heel of a gaudy red and blue sock, her eyes fast on John's face, her lips moving in count with the loops that slipped from her fingers. On his left, now moved a little farther back from the hearth, the lovers sat whispering and bobbing heads. What were they saying? Frank wondered. What of pretty, or of amorous even, could a lout like Ted \n\nRoss find wherewith to witch Nan's little ear? Suppose he, Frank Barry, in Ted's place, would he be able to say aught that Ted had never said, bring from Nan smiles that Ted had never seen, see something shining in her eyes that Ted might never see?

And to think that her beauty, her worth, were all for the keeping, sooner or later, of a bumpkin! It was woful, thought Frank; then, writhed on his chair, and set it creaking; and at the sound, Nan looked up, caught his eye, blushed, looked down and nudged her sweetheart. With a clatter of his stool and a muttered oath, round swung Ted; and Frank turning, found John's face, as round and rosy as a harvest-moon, turned full upon him. His eyes were twinkling; knowingly he winked at Frank, laughed and jerked his thumb towards the lovers. \"They make a purty pair?\" said he. \"Eh, Frank?\" Nan blushed deeper. Ted scowled. Frank grinned. \"I seen ye watchin' them,\" John went on. ye rascal ye.

Patiently the Dad plodded through a page of Macaulay; then closed the book on his thumb, set a chair in its right place, and came to the fire. His face was pulled solemn; in deep thought he stood for a moment, looking at his boots. \"Yes,\" said he, \"it's magnificent.\" He sighed, rubbed his nose; looked up. \"You know, Mr. \n\nLindsay,\" he went on, \"one of the greatest regrets I have is that I can't find leisure to peruse my books. Quite a lot of them I have-haven't I, Frank ?-quite a number of really excellent books; and yet, I assure you, there they stand, day after day, week after week, positively unopened. You see,\" said the Dad, with a wave of his hand, \"I have such a lot to do. Some most important transactions, some most confidential papers receive my consideration."}

A dead trust? Now a dead love? A dead love,\" he mused, smiling bitterly. \"Frank,\" cried Marian, \"be just to me. It isn't dead. No, no; I couldn't think that. But it seems gone. I can't help it. I've tried-oh, how I've tried! Give me time, Frank; just a little longer.\" From her heart Marian spoke, and with her hands out stepped towards Frank.

And nowhere did he shine more gloriously than by his own fireside; there, with his old father blankly eyeing him across the hearth, with Sarah his wife facing him, hands spread on her knees, back as straight as any ramrod, eyes and face very signals of attention, with Ted and Nan sitting mum at his elbow, and some chance visitor in the post of honour before the fire. At these times, John was great, but set a man such as Frank-a scholar, a Londoner and a Barry-in sight of the pothooks, and John was mighty. He quoted, ranted, banged his knees, whacked his fists, tore this poor Irish question into quivering shreds: whew-w, you might have thought him some impassioned patriot lunging it from \n\nTara's hill. And Frank, lounging in the chair of honour, now glancing at Nan, now at Sarah, sometimes flinging an encouraging word into the bonfire\nTHE BARRYS. of John's eloquence, enjoyed it all vastly; vowed to himself that the thing was worth all the screeds of \n\nHyde Park or the thunderings of Peckham Rye. Presently, John's tongue slackened somewhat, and, in the lull that came, Frank heard Nan laugh softly. He looked; there were our sweethearts with their heads together. Ted had twisted round on his stool, and cheek on hand was whispering; Nan, hands crossed on her lap, and her eyes lowered, was listening. Her lips were slightly parted; there was a smile on her face; and at sight of her Frank frowned. John's voice died out. Softly came the whispering. Sure, I waited an' waited for ye outside, an' ye niver came. Och, I niver heard one word the preacher said for thinkin' of ye.\" \"Did ye, Ted? Did ye?\" \"Och, ye might have managed to come. Sure, powerful lonely I was all the way home.\" \"Whisht, Ted, whisht;\" and at the word, Ted, suddenly aware that silence had fallen upon the kitchen, rushed round on his stool, glared at Frank; then leant towards the fire to light his pipe. Steadily Frank kept his eyes on Nan's face. How well that blush became her. What brows she had, what lips, what hair! Nan looked up, glanced at \n\nFrank, flushed crimson, and dropped her eyes again. Ah, what eyes, what eyes! John smoked for a while; rested elbows on knees, clasped his hands, turned once more towards Frank. \"You'd be thinkin' a power, Frank, o' the poetry o' Pope, I'm thinkin'?\" said he, cocking his head. \"No, John; as poetry I think but little of it.\" \"Ay? Just so. An' why, may I ask?\" 66\nINISHRATH. 69 \n\nOh, Frank had many reasons for his opinion: was \n\nJohn very anxious to hear them? Yes; John was bursting with anxiety. Well, then . . . and Frank went on to state his case. John listened attentively, contenting himself with an occasional snort of dissent, or a wondering click of the tongue; listened attentively till Frank had finished, then smacked his lips and turned to the fire. Ah, yes. Frank spoke like a newspaper, so he did. Pope didn't write poetry, said Frank; he was only a kind of pastrycook that baked cakes of prose and put a crust of rhyme on top. That was how \n\nFrank talked. Yes. \"But mebbe ye'd tell me,\" quoth John, glancing sideways at Frank, \"what ye might call this prose?\" Frank defined prose. \"An' what might ye call poetry?\" asked John, with a knowing look in his eye. Frank gave a definition of poetry. \"Ay,\" said John. \"I know. Well, there's a newspaper over there. D'ye call that poetry?\" Of course Frank did not. \"Well, in the top corner of that newspaper,\" John went on, \"ye'll find somethin' headed, An Ode to \n\nSpring. It goes like this ;\" and whacking his hands together in pace with the rhythm, John quoted a verse or two of hillside doggerel. \"D'ye call that prose, now?\" Of course Frank did not. \"Isn't poetry, then?\" John's voice rang in a shout of victory."}

Come on, sir, an' quit your bleather,\" cried Hugh; then, as if fearing lest \n\nFrank, at the last moment, should repent of his going, hurried on, wound up the hills and through the rushes; descended at last and came to the shore, and to James the herd sitting by it in his little cot.

Come,\" said Marian; then rose and moved towards the house; and after her, over the Dad's grass-plot and past the glory of his summer flowers, past the Dad himself and the Mother too,\nTHE BARRYS. bending their old backs over imaginary weeds, went Frank with the child in his arms-followed her through the parlour, and up into the little back bedroom which still was known as hers. Marian crossed, looked down upon the garden and the old folk standing there; shut the window, turned and stood waiting. Frank closed the door, sat the boy on the bed, kissed him and gave him a toy. \"There, my son,\" said he, patting the wee head; \"be good for a little while. Papa will soon take you again—soon take you again,\" repeated Frank; then wheeled quickly and took a step from the bed. \"Marian,\" said he, \"how much longer, I ask you, is all this to continue? Don't you think you have punished me quite enough? Suppose me the greatest of criminals, am I not still your husband and at least worth the trouble of an answer?\" Not a word could Marian say. Frank took another step towards her. \"Great heavens,\" cried he; \"what has come to you? Do you know what you are doing? Answer me, Marian; you must answer me! Do you know, say, what you are doing?\" There came a moment or two of silence, broken only by the deep swelling of Frank's breath and the gurgle of the boy over his play; a little while of silence, with Marian standing rigid by the dressingtable, and Frank facing her with clenched hands and blazing eyes. \"Do you know?\" he repeated, and at the words Marian looked at him. \"Know?\" she said, huskily and slowly. \"Yes, I know.\" She stopped; drew a breath that was half a sob, and raised a hand to her cheek. \"Oh,\" she\nLONDON. 365 said,\" I don't know what has come to me. I'm not myself. I can't speak. I feel numbed. The life seems to have gone from me. Frank, Frank,\" she cried; \"let me be! Give me time. I can't, I can't!\" The cry was piteous. Had it come sooner, perhaps\n\nFrank had heard, and done wisely. But now he was in no mood to understand. 66 Give you time? You can't? You mean, you won't,\" said Frank. \"You mean that it is I who have numbed you, and taken the life from you? You mean that still you believe your own imaginings rather than my words, believe me more guilty, far more guilty, than I am?” 66 said Marian. 99 \n\nNo, no, \"It's not that.\" \"Not that. Then, in Heaven's name, what?\" \"It's this,\" answered Marian."}
