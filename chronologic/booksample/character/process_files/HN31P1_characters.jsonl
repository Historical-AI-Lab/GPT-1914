Five-and-twenty years old, with a patent of nobility that dates from the Crusades, conferring a right to intrude in his sovereign's bedroom and present the shivering King of France with a clean shirt, it is natural that he should be overwhelmed with debt, a bad landlord, an unlucky gamester, a faithless lover, a dishonest politician, and an uncertain friend. He has not much to boast of; yet does he pride himself with some reason on the good looks, good digestion, good spirits, and good manners that, in a world like his, give him the reputation of a good heart."], [1, "Yes, he was handsome, there could be no question.

Her touch wandered lightly over the curve of her shoulders, the fall of her shapely waist."], [78, "beautiful and delicate in the moonlight, as if wrought in ivory or lace"], [80, "Rosine had a sound constitution as any young woman in France."], [82, "She smiled through her tears, laid her pale cheek against her lover's breast, and had dark eyes."], [83, "She is a girl of the people"], [86, "Rosine, not without many blushes and some te and more than one self-conscious smile"], [88, "now recovered from his wounds, fixed his eyes on Her Majesty, and sang the following lines in his mellow young voice"]]}
