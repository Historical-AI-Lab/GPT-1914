The main influence will be that due to the difference of moment of inertia about the longitudinal and lateral axes, and that will be fully discussed in Art. 53. 47. Summary of forces and moments. — We have to consider in connection with the lateral stability and control of a machine, (l) the lateral component of weight, WQ, (2) the lateral component of drift, DQ, (3) the horizontal component of engine thrust, H, (4) the lateral gyroscopic couple, YQ, due to yawing, (5) the rolling moment, Lp, due to rolling, (6) the yawing moment, Np, due to rolling, and (7) the moment due to difference of inertia. Let us imagine a machine flying steadily and levelly at a speed slightly above that for steady equilibrium. We then have a slight excess of thrust over drift, which we shall denote by E, and a slight excess of weight over lift, which we shall denote by Q. Any disturbance in the direction of rolling will then meet with the following resistance, (1) A yawing moment due to the lateral component of the excess of thrust H, which will be denoted by G; and (2) A rolling moment due to the lateral component of the excess of lift, which will be denoted by R. The disturbance will, therefore, be resisted by a couple of moment QG; and the restoring couple will be of moment QH.	1912	1961.8188
In order to make a good window or frame, it is necessary to see to it that the edges or walls of the window do not cut the subject in such a way as to produce a violent or disagreeable effect. If the subject be a person, the walls of the frame should not sever a hand, an arm, a leg, the head, or perhaps the body itself, though sometimes the cutting through the body is permissible in the case of animals because of the associated action involved. If the subject is a building, the walls should not cut into doors, windows, or architectural accessories that may be material in that particular building. This applies not only to photographs of homes, churches, public buildings, etc., but also to photographs of monolithic buildings like the Woolworth Building, cathedrals, and other huge structures, 21  where minor features can be completely lost if the whole or their reflection in the foreground pool is cut off.	1912	1952.2639
"It was like the door of the church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, which the order of the Knights of St. John kept so long in their keeping that they could never find the key to it themselves. The ancient door of the Winchester Cathedral was not immured, but it was locked; and if if had been opened, the pilgrims fancied that they should have found the shrine of the Blessed King and the ancient tomb of the sweet singer of ""In Memoriam"" unspeakably beautiful and affecting. The afternoon was not too hot, and they sought the great Cedar of Lebanon that spreads its shade in the close, and which they instinctively knew from Mr. Bough's description in ""The English Church in the Middle Ages."" They were quite alone there, and they sat down on the soft grass in a nook of the roots, and took off their hats, and breathed in the peace and freshness. The pigeons were strutting about and cooing at the foot of the tree. They were plump and white, and the pilgrim said, ""Those must have been purchased for the cathedral by the Emperor Louis Napoleon."" The other pilgrim said, ""No, they were not, my dear, those were the pigeons that Sir John Millais painted. The others are in the Luxembourg."" The first pilgrim said, ""Ah, yes, I remember, the last time I was here I was told that."""	1913	1883.4164
This can be done by giving the plant proper care and attention. The following general rules should be observed: 1. Do not allow wild grapes or other plants to grow near the vineyard, as they harbour the spores of the fungi. 2. Prune the vines properly so as to keep the centre open for circulation of air and light. 3. Cultivate the soil to prevent the roots from rotting. 4. Spray as recommended above. Insects Injurious to Grapes. The Grape Leaf Hopper (Erythroneura comes). This leaf hopper is a small (one eighth inch long) greenish white insect, which sucks the juice from the leaves of the grape. The first perceptible effect of its work is a yellowing of the leaves, which later curl and dry up. The young insects (the adult appears in June) suck the juice from the under side of the leaves, which is the cause of the yellowing and curling. They are very active and hop away at the slightest disturbance, which makes them difficult to catch. Remedies. Spray the vines with kerosene emulsion or with whale oil soap. The grape leaf folder (Desmia funeralis). This is a small, yellowish white worm, which curls up and hides in a fold of the grape leaf. The first perceptible effect of its work is a skeletonising of the leaf, which later turns brown.	1914	1928.6078
"The youngsters do; but us old blokes sit around and chip the old stone and yarn. This is our place, down here."" And a pity it is that no more conclusive statement of the attraction could be obtained. Sometimes they are not quite alone. Once in a long while, from some far town, one of their kind may arrive to announce that it is all over with them, that the last good claim is gone, and only the shallow ones are left, and that he has come down on a serious errand. His fellow mates receive him, ask no question, but with a steady eye withdraw a little to give his business its chance. When the hour is ripe, with one accord they jostle round him. ""Well, mate, what is it?"" ""Why — er — you see — "" and the newcomer hesitates, glances at the unyielding group, draws a long breath, and plunges in."	1913	1872.8746

THE NEW TWO FOOT CHANNEL. By A. F. S. 1. INTRODUCTION. In May, 1911, a contract was let to the Turner Construction Company for the building of a new two foot channel. The design of the channel was by the Hydraulic Laboratory staff and was based on the following specifications: 1. The channel was to have a uniform rectangular cross section of 2 X 2 feet. 2. The channel was to be straight and level for a distance of 60 feet from the inlet. 3. A contraction of the cross section to 1 X 1 feet was to be made over a distance of 10 feet, the contraction to be made by sloping the floor and the side walls of the channel in plan, the contraction being symmetrical with respect to the long axis of the channel.	1912	1887.2328
The photometric intensity is then approximately proportional to the square of the distance between the two lamps. In the experiments on the transmission and absorption of the various glasses we took the following colours of the spectrum : — 4.47 ana 4.31 (blue), 5-3 (green), 5-6 (yellow green), 6-6 (red), 7-4 (deep red). The first three colours are represented with a special intensity in our comparison lamp. With the aid of a prism it is easy to isolate the narrow band of the spectrum required, and the transmission of glasses for these wave lengths is specially important for the case of arc lamps in which blue and green are the colours which suffer most absorption. The following method of procedure was adopted : The intensity of the light transmitted through the glass was measured for different distances between the two lamps, and then the glass was removed and the intensity of the light from the comparison lamp alone measured. The thickness of the glass was then calculated from the two results. The thickness is taken to be that which transmits half the light, but obviously this is only approximate, since we cannot measure very small intensities. The thickness is calculated from the formula : d = - log 2 where I is the intensity of the light transmitted through the glass, and A the intensity of the light from the comparison lamp alone.	1912	1961.1029

"The place isn't ready yet — far from it, in fact — but the air and the sea are there just the same. Page, you're a dear for taking us in so promptly!"" "" The first of many times, I trust, "" said Page, as he bowed the gracious hostess up the hotel steps. Great Neck proved enchanting, although the Dolliver house there was bare and comfortless. Mrs. Manning and Marjorie, who chattered like blue jays, sat on the pine floor of the drawing room and made plans for the future, while Mrs. Manning's maid bustled in and out, unpacking the few things that had been brought from Newport. "" But, "" Marjorie exclaimed, "" is it really true that your husband isn't going to the Fall shoot at all?"" "" Quite true, "" said Mrs. Manning. "" His friend, Major Ferguson, who is running the place this year, telegraphed that they were all going to be very short of shooting hands, and Dan wired back that the doctor had forbidden him to shoot at all this autumn. The same thing happened last autumn, and he was broken up all winter and most of the spring. But now he's just splendid, and we think it was the foreign travel and the nursing and the change that did it. "" The way Marjorie's eyes shone told her hostess that she was happy."	1913	1899.2179

What Diderot thought of these novels he lets us know in a letter dated October 10, 1765. "" Madame Biccoboni,"" he writes, "" has at last sent me her works to read. I am now able to judge of her talent. It is something like that of Monsieur Biccoboni, the author of Le return de la montagne, a good clever fellow, who used to write with distinction, and whose sheets I corrected. Tell Madame Biccoboni that I will not translate her works, and that if she wishes to see them translated, she must write better."" One trifling work alone pleased Garrick, and that he undertook to have translated; this was the "" Dedicatory Epistle "" to Madame de Sancerre, in which Madame Biccoboni laments her fallen fortunes, the neglect of the world, her poverty, and the loneliness of her life in a foreign land. This appeal touched Garrick's heart, moved him to compassion, and inspired him with a feeling of gratitude, because, he declares, "" the celebrated Racine's daughter has not forgotten the humble player of the provinces."""	1912	1895.2112
"CHAPTER VII THE AMERICAN COLLEGE AND THE SCHOOL The American College and the School. — The relation of the college to the secondary school constitutes one of the problems of higher education which has received at times more attention than it deserves. I am convinced that the real difficulty is with the conception of the school rather than with the college. In some parts of the country, the secondary school is at present doing its work well, and the relation is at once natural and unembarrassed. In other sections, there is still much to be desired in the school, 61 62 and the result is strained relations or, at least, a lack of complete co-operation. This condition, however, is not peculiar to the American college. It is pointedly commented on by Dr. Harrison in his admirable book on the ""University of Berlin,"" where he says that from the first the University felt that it was not performing its whole duty to the State or to the science which it represented. The young men who underwent the instruction had indeed learned to regard the University as the proper centre of their professional training, and felt a pride in having been able to conquer the obstacles which lay in the way of their admission. But the University had not been able to make its influence felt in the Gymnasia, and where it did so it was by exciting the animosity of that arm of the educational system."	1911	1913.0704
"""The light from below fell full on the ice. It was not quite clear and transparent; there was a strange ruddiness in it, as of dawn light, as of the earthlight seen from the summit of Ben Lomond. He had seen that light in the sky when he was coming down from the Ben on morning of the day that was now far away and long ago.... And there, straight before him, as on that day far away and long ago, was the figure in the old grey tartan, the head bare, the long hair tumbled, and beside it, as that day far away and long ago, the figure of the girl in the cloutie. She turned her head slowly round, and she smiled with wide lips, and her eyes shone in the ruddiness of the earthlight. And she held out her hand."" The everything of the old tale is recognised in this appendix to it; and yet the atmosphere of the story, the imagination of the writer, do not rob it of appropriateness. But of Mr. Sharp's attitude towards mankind the two volumes of his posthumous stories give a very clear idea. For he was, to use a somewhat mixed metaphor, an artist born with all the instincts of his kind. Observance of the technical rules he laid down for himself was as unshakable as his observance of the laws of the unchanging ideal was lax. Each short story or tale had its own particular form; and if the author was at any time tempted to ease himself by putting two together, he was quickly stopped by the voice that from his heart, as I have said, never slumbered: a voice of awe, a voice of dread."	1913	1921.1045

"R. A. S. I. BURN OK. (May 3, 1910.) * The author begins by defining ""monolithic rudder"" as one made of some single piece of material, like wood, while that made up of several pieces, like steel, will be called ""composite."" In the ease of monolithic rudder, the moment of resistance to lateral bending is ■ VI  where Z is the moment of inertia of the rudder section about the x' axis through its centre of gravity. The distance R is the distance from the centre of gravity of the immersed part of the rudder to the line of action of the resultant of the lateral rudder force due to the drift. Then, if the rudder is to be one of constant designed efficiency, that is, one which will give the same lateral moment for unit drift at any angle of change of direction, we have It is customary to use a constant K, called the ""coefficient of direction,"" which varies with the design of the vessel, and to write the moment of resistance to lateral bending as M = KU2R. It is claimed that monolithic rudder will — (1) give a direct and uniform relation between the moment of lateral resistance and the square of the velocity ; (2) give a greater steering power with less deflection ; (3) reduce the tendency to "" flutter "" ; (4) give greater strength for the same weight. * Engineering, Lxxxi, B. 25."	1912	1969.0062
"In the Mesabi Range, as in the Vermilion, the chief mineral is haematite, or red oxide of iron, but as this substance is comparatively poor ore, containing only about fifty per cent of iron, there is an immense percentage of waste material to be removed. 1  i 84.  i  i i i The process of mining in the Mesabi is more simple than in the Vermilion, where the ore occurs in the form of lodes. There, the ore is found in pockets and in irregular lodes, while in the Mesabi it is in compact tabular masses, lying parallel to the slanting beds of the iron formation, the topographic features of the region. These tabular bodies of ore, called ""deposits, "" occur in the form of long, thin, horizontal sheets. The average thickness of a sheet is about thirty feet, while its length, where not interrupted by faults, is about a mile, and its width, taken at right angles to its length, is about two miles. The main deposit, the ""Taconite, "" has been traced for a distance of more than fifty miles. It does not dip, like the Vermilion deposits, but lies nearly horizontal. The mining operations and processes are, therefore, somewhat different from those on the Vermilion Range. The ore is exposed at the surface, and, as it has very little or no overburden, the strippings are small. The ore is mined by ""open pit "" methods, after removal of the overburden. A typical open pit mine consists of a series of benches, formed by removing strips of ore, one above the other, until the pit reaches an average depth of three hundred feet."	1911	1871.8938
And this, too, is a part of the meaning of tolerance — that we should not shrink from the recognition of the fact that our own present ideas of reality may be as far from the truth as those of the twelfth century. In a word, we must go back to the principle of the nineteenth chapter of the Gospels — the principle of the tolerance which is based on the recognition of the fact that we are all struggling towards the same ideal, even though our methods of attaining it may seem to be directly opposed. And it is here that the recognition of the unity of the human mind becomes a most important factor. The mind of the present generation is not the same as that of the generation that is passing away.	1913	1937.504
"Gradually he changed his tactic. He appealed to the emotions, to the pride of the Westerners, to the fact that the very life of the West depended on water, and that the East had a right to be up in arms over the water that was being daily wasted, in order to save a few scores of dollars a month. Some of the listeners said they meant to go away hating the Forest Service; but when they did go, their hearts were with Pinchot. He was actually a Western man, as a Texan told him afterwards, ""under the skin."" He had been heartened by letters from Roosevelt, and from other former members of his administration, which he read to them. Pinchot, however, was not more than a year out of the government service. He had been dismissed from the Forestry Bureau in 1910 because of his outspoken opposition to Republican policies in Congress in regard to conservation. The first of the three lectures I heard him deliver was in a small church on Nob Hill. The only other time I ever saw a man thus heartened and glad, was in Denver in the early days of the World War when Wilson was the speaker. Pinchot's is a singular gift of inspiring confidence. And that quality is of the very first importance in a leader, for it gives courage to other men, it helps them to make up their minds, it makes them willing to act, to take chances."	1911	1929.2318
The matted row system is the one generally adopted by commercial growers and by many home gardeners. The plants are set out in rows two and one half to three feet apart, and about one foot apart in the row. Where strong growing varieties are used, two feet apart in the row will give better results. Thefirstyear the rows are kept clear of runners as much as possible, so that a space of about one foot between the plants may be kept open. As the plants grow and send out runners, these are encouraged to root down by covering them lightly with soil, and as the runners root down and make new plants, the space between the plants closes. By the end of the season the rows are compact masses of plants six to twelve inches wide.	1914	1925.4208

"Now for the plate. I took a plate from the box and wrote on the back of it in a pencil, ""Metre stop f-32 equals thirty seconds at f 8."" Then I put it in the slide and rushed it into the dark room and put it into a light tight box. Out to the subject again and made ready for the exposure. First I placed a piece of black cloth over the paper ball, then I placed a piece of white cloth over the paper ball. The white cloth was shaded by a piece of green glass. Now I was ready, with shutter opened one second, to expose the plate for thirty seconds. I counted thirty seconds aloud, then, one second before closing up the shutter, I took away the black cloth and placed it over the green glass shading the white cloth. Now I was ready to expose the plate for another thirty seconds, counting thirty seconds aloud."	1912	1927.9602
The Exhibition had, perhaps, the same effect to a certain extent, but on a far inferior scale. One great fault of shop windows generally was, that the lamps were not reflected as they ought to be. If a lamp was visible in a window, it was generally too weakly placed, and one lamp was hardly sufficient to give a glow over the window as well as its own reflection. The general effect in the Exhibition was that of a patch, so that it should be remembered that a shop window was not a picture. A window to be artistic must have depth, and to be well lighted it could not be shallow. For that reason he did not think the mode of lighting shop windows introduced in the American Exhibition would be particularly pleasing.	1912	1881.3156

But in so far as the tendencies to be described are not directly implied in the social organism of the community in which they are presented, but are derived from more general and more permanent arrangements of the social mind, it will be necessary for the branch of Comparative Religion under consideration to avail itself of the laboratory methods of Social Psychology, in so far as such methods allow of the experimental isolation of those tendencies of the social mind which are especially religious. We may note in closing that the problems set by the method of Social Psychology will in practice be found to be either more or less complicated, according to the stage of the development of the cultural phenomena with which we are dealing. At the lower stages, the social organisation is for the most part relatively simple, and the direct or indirect action of religion on other departments of life can be easily observed.	1908	1901.4849
"The subject is a terrible one — the rape of a girl with a child afterwards — but Mr {John) Glendinning's treatment of it is so powerful, and yet so restrained, that one emerges from the experience with a vivid picture of the horrors of the thing without any sense of having been shocked unnecessarily. The poses are excellent, and the whole composition is based on a harrowing realism, which is so convincing that after looking at it one almost seems to hear the cries of the victim. This is a picture to be studied seriously, and it is a rare thing nowadays to find a painter who can be relied on to put a strong subject boldly before us, and yet remain within the bounds of good taste.

As already explained, the difference between the readings of the two thermometers is due to the cooling effect of the evaporation of the moisture from the wet bulb and the amount of this cooling is a measure of the humidity. The psychrometer is a very simple and useful instrument and should be in every greenhouse or hot bed. In case it is not possible to have a thermometer with the degrees marked in the centre, the glass should be read from the level of the eye and not from the top of the mercury column. The Thermograph. — For purposes of record the maximum and minimum thermometers are often replaced by the thermograph or self registering thermometer. This consists of a very delicate thermometer so attached to a clock work arrangement that as the mercury expands or contracts it moves a pencil which is tracing a line on a sheet of paper. The sheet of paper is turned by the clock work once in twenty-four hours, so that a continuous record is made. The sheet of paper is ruled with a number of horizontal lines, each one of which represents one degree. The thermograph is sometimes made so that it records the variation in humidity as well as temperature. The Hygrometer. — The hygrometer is an instrument for measuring the relative humidity of the air, or the amount of moisture present in the air compared with that which the air can hold when saturated.	1914	1938.1207
The Council of State is the executive body (Exekutive) and as such is the 39  highest military authority in the canton. It supervises the administration of the justice system, the finances and the public schools of the canton, as well as the police and the sanitary condition of the cities, and has the power to grant pardons. One member of the Council of State acts as president of the Grand Council and presides over the sessions of both councils. It is . the duty of each member of the Council of State to supervise two or three departments of the executive office, although, except for the general supervision, the President of the Grand Council takes no part in the work of the Council of State. The Council of State has far-reaching powers in the administration of the canton and is really the most important of the three branches of the government, particularly since the introduction of the referendum and the popular initiative. The president and vice president of the Council of State are elected by the Grand Council from among the members of the Council of State. The officers elected by the Grand Council also include the members of the Council of States. This council consists of four members elected by the Grand Council, and it is the duty of the members of this council to represent Aargau in the national affairs of the Swiss Confederation. The three branches of the government are elected for terms of four years.	1911	1893.3896
They were determined to sell their lives dearly, and, if necessary, to perish in the flaming ruins of the structures they were sworn to defend. At the same time the question of food was becoming serious, and on that account alone it was desirable to bring about a speedy conclusion to the struggle. A council of war was held at the War Office, and it was there decided that a further and final supreme effort should be made to regain the passage of the river, and to deliver the area of London from the invader. On the morning of the 26th September the Germans were in force at all the bridges — at Chelsea, Battersea, Wandsworth, Putney, and Hammersmith. The line of defence was held by the few regulars remaining, the Metropolitan Police, and certain City reserves.	1906	1871.1061

"" asked the Squire, rising to his feet. "" I mean that you are a mean, low — "" she was going to say "" scoundrel, "" but she stopped herself just in time — "" a mean, low man."" "" You forget yourself, "" said the Squire, "" I will not allow you to address me in this manner."""	1908	1889.764
The service adopted the principle of voluntary registration. No one was sent, but all were given a chance to choose a place. The government made no discrimination, but took workers from the classes which the employers preferred to have. As the result of the twelve months trial, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Federation of Labour, and the United States Employment Service have come to an agreement to work together, because all have been convinced that the system of voluntary registration, without charge, is for the best interests of the employer and the worker. This agreement has been reached at a time when the voluntary service is being transformed into a permanent service.  CHAPTER II THE TRANSITION TO A PERMANENT SERVICE THE FIRST MOVE The first step in the transformation of the voluntary service into a permanent service was made by the Secretary of Labour, following the provisions of the act of Congress. This act created the United States Employment Service as part of the Department of Labour. The Secretary of Labour has issued an order setting forth the principles which are to govern the work of the new service. These principles, as set forth in the order, are as follows: l. The service is to be a service to the worker, to the employer, and to the community. 2. It is to be the service of the United States, and not of any State, municipality, or other political division. 3. It is to be administered in accordance with the principle of home rule. 4. The service in each local district is to be under the control of a local board created in accordance with the laws and the rules of the State in which the district is situated.	1913	1920.0657
"In the United States the Socialist party is rapidly growing in numbers and power, and many cities and some states are electing Socialist officials. There are numerous Socialist papers, magazines, clubs, and many books by Socialists, that are widely read. Land, natural resources, and production are being socialised, or at least partially so, in various countries and cities. In our own country the annexation of the Philippines, with the land there, and the socialisation of the water power in a few of our states, have been accomplished. The great corporations, having absorbed our railroads and most of our manufactures, are socialising the production and distribution of the supplies of food and clothes for workingmen. The many corporations that have combined have socialised transportation and the production of iron and steel, cotton, oil, gas, copper and many other products. Socialism is already here, and the movement for more, and for more intensive socialised production, is rapidly spreading. It is not part of the general movement or spirit of Socialism, but merely a by product of our land monopoly, that this pres Socialist land grabbing movement is being rapidly developed. King says, in the last quotation that will be made from him, that ""adjoining farmers living in peopled parts of the country have a hard fight to hold their farms. Tourist associations are boosting the prices till they sell to summer boarders at a good premium. 'We live in a cottage."	1911	1891.5922
"As they walked through the darkening streets it was 13  near eleven. Marcia's spirits danced anew. When they reached the Burlington Arcade, she bade him good night, with a touch of the lover's gaiety which was very pretty. She watched him spring down the steps and disappear into the throng of the Haymarket. ""Will you go again tomorrow?"" he said, looking back to her as she stood in the waning light. And her heart was singing — ""Yes, and the day after and the day after!"" ""Luncheon?"" she answered with an elfish laugh. ""Then I will escort you to your grave!"" But his face had changed as he said the words. ""To my grave? Why?"" There was no elfishness now. He was intensely troubled. She assured him, however, that there was no ""grave"" — that her wretched hours were over; but that he must not ask her any more questions about her life. She had been foolish, poor, proud, and a little ferocious. Now she was going to live and enjoy, like everyone else. He acquiesced, though he was by no means convinced. He saw she was hiding something. Who was the shadow that had passed and repassed through these rooms? who was the person whose memory she had just enshrined with that fresh, that startling Phaedra-like touch? And why, in the books, had she written ""Mr."	1913	1950.2606
Then, under escort, they were taken to the north side of the Serpentine, where a machine gun was mounted and a deep trench had been dug. There they were shot down in batches of ten, the bodies being hastily covered with earth. Then, the work accomplished, Von Kleppen returned to Dorchester House, where he entertained a number of officers at dinner. There is no doubt that this is a violation of the usages of civilised warfare, and in the event of the Germans being driven out of London, Von Kleppen will have to answer for his actions at the bar of the law. The English, however, are not in a position to complain of barbarities at the hands of the enemy. The conduct of our troops in Ireland has been little short of savage, and the reports that reach us from the west of England are even more disquieting.	1906	1922.3246
"In it he said : "" The Indian Exchequer has been balanced since the mutiny, and there has been a steady and a large surplus every year. That surplus has been applied partly to reducing the public debt, partly to increasing the military and civil establishment, and partly to reducing the rates of taxation. The total reduction of taxation since 1858 comes to £7,000,000 a year. The most important item is the abolition of the salt tax, which cost nearly £4,000,000 a year."" A more recent statement, however, is to the effect that, notwithstanding the large surplus, the present Indian Government is being forced to raise the income tax, and to charge salt with a tax of Id. per lb. The salt tax is a tax on the poor, and its imposition means that the poor are being called upon to bear a heavier burden than they have hitherto done. Mr. John Morley went on to say in the Budget Speech quoted above : "" The Government of India, after considering the whole question, and after consulting the most competent advisers, military and financial, have come to the conclusion that, without any increase of burden, and without any dislocation of the civil or military machinery, the Indian army may be reduced by a total of 50,000 men. I do not say that that is the last word on the subject, but it is a considerable first step in the right direction."" The question of Indian re armament is one which is attracting a great deal of attention at the present moment."	1907	1906.889
"he shouted. "" Yes, it is our duty as Englishmen — it is the duty of every single man in England, to the last of us, to do his best at this crisis, and not to slacken effort until the last German has been driven from English soil. And when we have done this, we will concern ourselves no more with the German who is in England. Ah, but there are plenty of good Germans as well as good Englishmen in England. Good Germans ! What is a good German ? A good German is a man who fights for Germany. There is no distinction among Germans. The German people have done what their Emperor has told them. We have to do what ours tells us. (Loud cheers.) All this talk about the good Germans in England is absurd. Let them go to Germany ! We don 't want them here ! (Loud and prolonged cheers.) The only question before us is how to drive out the invader, and to see that he doesn 't get in again ! (Loud cheers.) Let those who are not able to take the field in the fighting line, but still are able to handle a rifle, go to their club or to the volunteer corps once every week, and let every Englishman who can hold a rifle help to teach the others. Let every man go and enlist to-day and not put it off any longer. """	1906	1908.3853
To indicate still further the difference between Syndicalism and Socialism, we might say that while Socialism aims at a co operative system within the nation, Syndicalism aims at a co operative world. If we believe that ownership of the world must ultimately be social ownership, how can we remain satisfied with a social system in the nation, and a competitive system in the world? If we must have national organisation of sovereign owners for the purpose of preserving ourselves as a sovereign nation, how can we remain satisfied with such a national organisation if the world is organised on a competitive basis? Therefore, Syndicalism aims at a co operative world. And the only way to build a co operative world is to proceed as the Syndicalist proposes. That is, each industrial organisation in the world must refuse to enter into competition, and must, in such a way as to be effective, refuse to enter into competition with the industrial organisations in its own nation and the industrial organisations in other nations. The only way, as far as we can see, for the world to become organised on a co operative basis is for every industrial organisation to refuse to enter into competition with other industrial organisations in its own nation and with the industrial organisations in other nations. This refusal to compete must be general, and, if it is to be effective, it must be almost universal. And this is exactly what the Syndicalist proposes that the workers shall do in every industry.	1911	1963.4606
"One of the Members of the House of Commons was sent out by the Liberal group to see what was the state of feeling there; and to his astonishment every single leader of the Labour Party said, "" Of course the Indians will not be allowed to settle among us, "" and the Liberal leaders had to agree. But they based their refusal on economic grounds. They said, ""There is not room for your people, as we want all our labouring population to be white, "" and they did not base their refusal on racial grounds. And what is the difference? The difference is this. A refusal on economic grounds means that any time in the future Australia may have too small a labour market and will not be able to protect white labour to such an extent, and then they may be willing for your people to go, whereas a refusal on racial grounds would be final — it would mean that because you were of a particular race you would be kept out; and if you were coming on a mission to Australia, you would be getting your things ready for a very long voyage."	1914	1923.3348
In a typical case of general illumination the light source is a lamp, chandelier, or other fixture mounted in such manner as to be out of the way of interference with normal activity. The lamp may, although this is not essential to general illumination, be provided with a reflector, which may, however, in addition to increasing the intensity of illumination in the direction of the beam, cause a sharp limitation of the direction of illumination, such limitation producing an effect which is intermediate between general and localized illumination. The surface of the room is in many cases treated as a reflector, which, while in no way aided by mechanical means in its function of redistributing the light, makes up by its area for the relatively small intensity of the source or sources.	1912	1885.2992
I was introduced to her by a certain man and woman who, though extremely amiable, never do anything of any account. The actress was very agreeable, and her beauty delighted me. She is tall, very slim, and has the loveliest neck I ever saw. Her brown hair is not too abundant; her complexion is freshness itself; her eyes are not very large, but her mouth is superb, full of charm and vivacity. I made her a little present through my secretary, who went to see her play. In the evening I wanted to go and see that famous man, General Sherman. He is the chief of the army and is generally very reserved, but when one knows how to manage him he can be made to talk by the hour, because the more you draw him out the more interesting he becomes.	1913	1893.1432
Second, society should be so well advanced in political organisation as to have at command the necessary resources for supporting institutions of learning and for securing the members of the learned professions and scientific investigators against the burden of a struggle for existence. These resources are usually supplied by the governing class. Third, the intellectual interests of society should be so well advanced that the members of the governing and of the wealthy classes will be sufficiently aroused to appreciate the importance of the advancement of learning and of science, and will be willing to devote part of their time and part of their means to the securing of that advancement. This interest is usually the result of the activity of the learned professions. It has already been indicated that the influence of the learned professions in the advancement of learning and of science is exerted in two ways. They exert a direct influence in investigating, collecting, and preserving knowledge. They exert an indirect influence by exciting the interest of the wealthy and of the governing classes through the appreciation they themselves show for the advantages derived from the advancement of learning and of science. Of course the degree of interest aroused varies with the particular profession and the degree of activity in the profession. The results of this influence are more striking in the advancement of learning than in the advancement of science, because the learned professions, as a whole, are more closely allied to the professions of learning than to the professions of science. This is particularly true in the case of the legal profession. The lawyer has a more intimate and more constant relation to the work of literary and historical investigations than to that of scientific investigation and research.	1911	1903.1831
General Characteristics. Mica is found in a number of places in Norway, especially in the southern and central parts of the country; but the output is of little importance. The occurrence is principally in pegmatitic veins, but some of the deposits are in amphibolite gneiss, syenite, and granite. The larger portion of the mica obtained comes from the pegmatitic veins in gneiss. The mines are situated at an altitude of from 1,640 to 3,280 feet. The veins are usually tabular and vary in dip from forty to eighty degrees. The pegmatite varies in thickness from one to ten feet, but becomes much wider at places, and it is over one hundred feet in thickness at the largest development. The deposit usually forms a wedge, gradually decreasing in thickness and pinching out at both ends.	1905	1909.0367
"Behind the little house, and almost touching the fence, was a small pigpen in which John Henry raised two or three pigs. His wife fed the pigs and the chickens and milked the cow. Sometimes, however, he was so busy that he forgot to provide feed, and the pigs and the chickens and the cow went hungry. That was not very often, though, for he was careful in regard to the feeding of the animals. A man cannot run a garden and raise animals at the same time unless he is very careful indeed. When the fence was completed John Henry stepped back to look at it, and as he looked he smiled. ""Now I am safe, "" he said to himself. ""Now I can work at my garden, and no one will see me."" He had some seed potatoes and some flower bulbs that he wished to plant, and after a moment he turned and went into his little house and got a spade and a hoe and began to dig in the earth just inside the fence. The work was hard, for the ground was rough and full of stones, and the fence had to be set deep in the earth to keep out the wild animals. For a long time he worked, digging and hoeing and grunting, and finally, when he was only a little way along the fence, he stopped and straightened up and wiped the perspiration from his head."	1913	1929.1069
"My readers should understand that this statement in no way militates against my earlier reports, which stated our forces to be comparatively weak, but is merely based on the most trustworthy detailed information which has been placed at my disposal. "" Meanwhile an even more important event has occurred, which, while solving the immediate problem before us, appears to place the future of the country definitely beyond all doubt. On Wednesday evening, immediately after I had concluded my report for that issue, telegrams were received from Lord Kitchener, announcing that he had landed in England, after having returned at the head of some twenty thousand veteran troops and an immense force of artillery. "" In addition to this, the bulk of the Indian Army has been mobilised and is on its way to Egypt, whither it is to be conveyed in transports supplied by our Ally Japan, and there awaited by a large number of British battalions already stationed at Cairo."	1906	1877.3738
The minimal group of three, as we have seen, is not only the minimal group of three; it is also the minimal group of four. It is the minimal group of three plus the minimal unit of the city. As the family sentiment is the sentiment of the minimal group of three, so the civic sentiment is the sentiment of the minimal group of four. The minimal group of four, like the minimal group of three, has its own special problems. The problems of the city, like the problems of the family, are not the problems of the individual. They are the problems of the minimal group. The problems of the city are the problems of the minimal group of four. In the city, as in the family, the individual is not the unit. The individual is the unit of the market; the minimal group is the unit of the city. The minimal group of four, like the minimal group of three, has its own special possibilities. The possibilities of the city, like the possibilities of the family, are not the possibilities of the individual. They are the possibilities of the minimal group. The possibilities of the city are the possibilities of the minimal group of four. In the city, as in the family, the individual is not the hero. The individual is the hero of the market; the minimal group is the hero of the city. The minimal group of four, like the minimal group of three, has its own special sentiment. The sentiment of the city, like the sentiment of the family, is not the sentiment of the individual.	1908	1953.2808
"The author is evidently a doyen of biographers. The work is a model of literary craftsmanship. The style is clear, concise, vigorous, and adorned with none of the dusty and lifeless gewgaws of literary ornamentation. It is a book for busy men and women. No two pages are taken up with the same fact, and there is absolutely no uninteresting matter in the whole volume. The illustrations are good and appropriate. The book is well printed, the binding handsome, and it is altogether a volume to be admired, not only for what it contains, but for what it is. Anti Superstition. By Rev. G. B. Thomas, M.A. Cloth. Pp. 292. Price $2.00 net. New York: Dresden Publishing Company. The author of this volume is a great admirer of Colonel Ingersoll, and he has dedicated the book to his memory. The title of the book indicates the broad scope of its contents. While the first part of the work is taken up with the discussion of the supernatural and the ""miracles"" of the Bible, the second part is devoted to a study of modern ""inspired"" literature. The author examines with much care and with the utmost severity the pretentious writings of the numerous ""prophets"" of today. The book is a powerful indictment of modern superstition and a most effective refutation of modern ""revelations."""	1911	1886.7509
Fig. 6 is a good example of a large panel sign. The design is not very artistic, but the effect is good. It is in the Strand, London. Fig. 7 shows a pictorial sign in the Strand. The colours are well chosen, and the effect is pleasing. The sign is a large one, but the panel is not so large as that in the preceding illustration. It will be noted that the artist has taken advantage of the fact that the design is illuminated only on one side, and has made the figure of the man look as if he were stepping out of the sign. Fig. 8 is a panel sign in Piccadilly, London. It is interesting because of the artistic arrangement of the colours. The design is a little too elaborate, but the effect is good. In all these signs the lamps are white, and the colours are painted on the back of the glass. The lamps are set in grooves cut in the woodwork (see Fig. 9). The grooves are painted white, so that they reflect the light. Fig. 9 is a close view of the same sign as Fig. 8. It shows the grooves in which the lamps are set, and the circular ends of the tubes of glass. The tubes are not fixed in the grooves, but are held in their places by metal rings, which are painted white to match the grooves.	1912	1909.1488
"To the same effect writes his wife: "" You tell me that it is not easy to get rid of Mr. Lacy. My dear friend, I beg you to believe that he is still more awkward to keep. I have been obliged to renew my season, for fear he should let the door close on his own nose, and to give my orders not to let him in till I call him; for, since he has been in my house, he has caused me more uneasiness than all the gouty patients I have had for the last thirty-five years."" In truth, "" Mr. Lacy "" seems to have been an exacting, as well as a persistent lover. To all the feminine reproaches and grievances set forth by his lady, Garrick replied with the utmost good humour. ""Lacy, "" he wrote to Noverre, ""is sorry for any trouble he has given Mad. Noverre, and says the beauty of the dances he has seen at Paris, and the great honour of seeing the Noverres at the Haymarket, and that the one was not half so pleasing as the other, makes him wish that he could see the Noverres both better and oftener. . . . Noverre, the father, will wait your arrival at Paris, and my wife and I will be impatient till we see you both, and we hope the coldness which you say has possessed my countrymen will give way to warmth and esteem."	1912	1885.9277

Love had been there, And left its aching sweetness in the breath Of flowers that opened wide their souls to him. The moonlight fell like whispered words of Love On the white lilies, who, with drooping heads And fragrant sighs of sorrow, told the tale Of Love's desertion. The tall hollyhocks, In crimson and white and yellow, burned with shame To see the lilies thus dishonoured, And Were glad when the soft wind blew them away To distant parts of the garden, where Love Had never been, or, having been, had left, Not that soft ache of sweetness in the heart, But the sharp stings of hatred, anger, revenge. The air was filled with murmurs of reproach, Of jealousy, of passion, of despair. The jasmine, hung against the walls like pearls Upon the neck of some proud queen, was sad As one who manifestly must endure Another's shame, yet had no power to help. The roses, with their myriad faces, mocked The lilies, and made merry with their grief, Until at last the lilies, shamed to death, Drooped all their heads and wept as one, and were Gone swiftly from the garden, where Love had Not been, or, having been, had left the sweet Ache of regret alone. The violets, Who had not known the presence of the god, Were glad, and sang like birds that have escaped Some danger, and were free to soar again.	1911	1884.4462
"That is my last word."" CHAPTER VIII THE JUDGE INTERVENES A GOOD deal of childish bitterness finds vent in that simple little four-line rhyme, "" Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, Eating her curds and whey, When down came a spider, who sat down beside her, "" and frightened Miss Muffet away. Anthony and Olive sat together on a tuffet of their own the next day after the Judge's curt sentence — a tuffet made of old boards, on a little patch of grass and moss, shaded by a box bush — and each was eating a slice of bread, without curds or whey. They were waiting for the Judge to keep his word and let them see their mother. Neither spoke until the sun began to set crimson across the river, when Anthony exclaimed impatiently : "" I wonder what he's waiting for? I'd rather do anything than see her in his presence. He won't let us speak to her, I suppose. Just the same, I can't sit still any longer. I'm going to find him."" Anthony started up, but before he had taken two steps he came to a dead halt, petrified with astonishment. Coming slowly up the river path, between the two white tents, with the droop of a light cane at her side, a yellow silk parasol in her hand, and her beautiful face partly shaded by a picture hat of pale brown straw, was exactly the image of Olive's mother that they had seen day after day in the Judge's study."	1913	1886.6012
The author advocates a modification of the flicker photometer, which has the advantage of requiring no adjustment of the distance of the standard lamp. He also calls attention to the fact that the colour of the standard lamp should be that of the light under which the object to be compared is usually seen. In this way the question of colour temperature of the standard lamp is important, and the author finds that the best results are obtained when the standard is a Welsbach incandescent mantle. The paper is illustrated by a number of good photographs. The articles noticed above are but a few of those which have appeared during the past year on the subject of Electric Lighting. It is evident that progress is being made in the direction of securing the best distribution and effect from the electric light, and we may hope to see much advance in this branch of engineering in the near future. 4. A new form of incandescent lamp, designed to give a uniform distribution of light, has been put on the market by the General Electric Company of America. The filament is of peculiar form, and is enclosed in a bulb of special shape. The lamp is said to give a light equivalent to that of a flat reflector lamp of 30 to 40 watts, while only 25 watts are used. 5.	1912	1921.3013
In 1749 he published his Novels, then a volume of Poems, 1751, and in 1752 two Letters to Zachariadseum. He came to Paris in the autumn of 1753 and entered the service of the British Ambassador, Sir Edward Thorn ton. Finally he became attached to the service of the dukes of Ancaster. See D. L. R., vi. 433-36. 1 lt may be well to point out here that John Cleland is quite distinct from the Cleland mentioned in the Lettres de Cachet (Letters of a Rayonnant Philosopher in the ivth part), and to whom reference has been made above (p. 40 and n. 1). He was a certain Robert Cleland, whose infatuation for Diderot's daughter served Patu as an adventure in his novel of Le Philosophe de la cour (p. 33 n. 1). 55 he awaits Garrick's order to allow him to act as his prompter. By means of Cleland, who was his introducer to Lord Melcombe, and through Lord Melcombe, who was his patron and protector, he finds a room in his house. There he devotes himself to the study of English literature, and especially that great poet, who was then proclaimed by Johnson's work to be the greatest of poets, 'who has penetrated the darkest recesses of the human heart, revealed its most secret workings, exposed all its follies, and displayed its best virtues in the most captivating light.'	1912	1890.3969
"It is like a game, and we are at the most interesting point in the play. And those are the most beautiful trees I have ever seen."" "" You ought to see them in the fall, "" said the American. "" You ought to see the apples they bear."" "" Apples, "" said Lieutenant Schmidt, with a slight shudder. "" I have had enough of apples. I have no desire to see any more apples. Apples are the one fruit which I cannot endure. I would rather go without fruit than eat apples. You have no idea how many apples I have eaten in the past two weeks."" "" And yet you are still alive, "" said the American, gravely. "" Yes, "" said Lieutenant Schmidt, "" I am still alive, but I am very unhappy. The apple is the one fruit which I cannot endure."" "" How about doughnuts?"" asked the American. "" Doughnuts?"" Lieutenant Schmidt's face brightened. "" Ah, that is different. I adore doughnuts. I could live on them. I could eat a dozen at one sitting."" "" I will try to arrange it, "" said the American, who was always ready to welcome an opportunity to make himself agreeable. "" But here are some of our own men, "" he added, as he caught sight of the two troopers who were riding toward them from the village. "" They will tell us what is happening."""	1913	1898.6278
In the British Museum the name of Lyell is inseparably connected with the geological collections, those of Owen with the fossil vertebrates, and a whole group of names with the invertebrate series. In the Natural History Museum the collections are first associated with the name of Huxley and then with the names of the men who worked under him. The collections of the Peabody Museum at Yale are intimately connected with the names of Marsh and Cope, and so on. The collections of the American Museum of Natural History are associated with those of Professor Osborn, Dr. Allen, Dr. Buller, Dr. Robinson, Dr. Gilder, Dr. Peters, Dr. Duerst, Dr. Bartsch, Dr. Stejneger, Dr. Merriam, Dr. Miller, and many others. It is in this way that the institution is judged. The public does not separate the names of the curators from those of the collections, and it is right that it should not do so. It is not a question of the number of specimens, but of the quality of the work represented by them. With the names of the men whose work is represented in a collection, the institution stands or falls in the eyes of the world.  9 The collections of the United States National Museum are in the mind of the public inseparably associated with the names of Professor Leland, Professor Marsh, Professor Cope, Professor Langley, Dr. Duerst, Dr. Gilder, Dr. Peters, Dr. Bartsch, Dr. Stejneger, Dr. Merriam, Dr. Miller, and many others. It is in this way that the institution is judged. The public does not separate the names of	1911	1938.0164
In Italy I was fortunate enough to be received by Signor C. Giordani, chief Inspector of Mines, and to visit the Exhibition, where I was met by Prof. Capello, Professor of Mineralogy and Geology at the University of Turin, and Inspector of Mines. I had previously received from Inspector Giordani a letter of introduction to my future colleague, the Professor of Mechanics. Through the kindness of President Alberto Beneduce, of the Royal Committee of the Exhibition, I was allowed to visit the Exhibition before it was formally opened. The Italian Exhibition was not confined to mining machinery, but presented a complete survey of the industrial progress of the Italian nation. Italy is one of the youngest of the industrial nations of Europe, and the efforts which she has made to bridge over the interval which separated her from older nations are well illustrated by the contents of this Exhibition.	1912	1890.8755
". . . The growth of a language in the sense of complexity is one sign of a lower culture. . . . When we compare the simplicity of the Greek and Latin sentence with the unwieldy structure in which an English thought is left to struggle for existence, we perceive how much chaos in comparison with the initial chaos from which the Greek and Latin sentence sprang we have introduced into our own tongues in the name of progress. . . . But it would be a serious mistake to suppose that in the reorganisation of English there has been no evolution. . . . We have withdrawn from the use of a large number of words which served a temporary need. When a process has been established by the use of a simple word, the derivative has been laid aside. Thus, instead of the Latin derived ""convene, "" we use the Anglo-Saxon word ""meet."" When, from long use, a process becomes familiar, we do not try to express it with a circumlocution, but use the simple word which came down to us from the days when such processes were unknown, though now they"	1911	1950.9708
"The former shows the sign by day, and the latter shows the appearance by night when illuminated. The sign is made in the form of a metal box, the outside surface of which is painted some pleasing colour. The inside is whitened, and the letters are cut out of the front panel, thus exposing the whitened interior. The letters are made up of a number of small incandescent lamps, the filaments of which are arranged to form the letters. The effect of this arrangement is that when the sign is lighted the letters appear to glow, and the whitened interior reflects the light, thus adding to the beauty of the sign. The back of the box is made of glass, and the sign is mounted on a wall or other support by means of brackets, or it may be suspended from the ceiling. The sign is enclosed in a metal box, and is thus protected from the weather, and is therefore suitable for either indoor or outdoor use. It is made in a number of standard sizes, and is wired for 100 volt current, but other voltages may be had if desired. The Illuminating Engineering Society, in their pamphlet on "" Signs and Sign Lighting, "" published in July, 1910, say: "" The use of incandescent lamps as a means of forming letters is still common, and is probably the best method for certain classes of work."	1912	1880.3842
They are, however, well worth trying in the southern parts of the middle and northern states, as some of the varieties are quite hardy. The trees are not large growers and the branches are rather brittle. The trees come into bearing when quite young and the fruit is usually of fine quality. The fruit is usually seedless, and the seeds are not viable. The fruit is not astringent, as a rule, when fully ripe and is very delicious. They are usually eaten raw and are very pleasant and healthful. They are also dried for winter use. All the Japanese persimmons are dioecious and it is necessary to plant a number of trees if one wishes to have fruit. The trees are easily propagated by budding and grafting and also by planting seeds, but the latter are not viable. The best method of propagation is by grafting on the common persimmon. The American persimmon is very hardy and will thrive in any good agricultural soil. It is easily propagated by planting seeds or by budding and grafting. The trees are not very large growers, but come into bearing when quite young. The fruit is usually astringent and its quality is variable. It is not as good, as a rule, as the Japanese persimmon and is usually eaten dried. The trees are very ornamental and the fruit will be used more and more in the future.	1914	1908.4175

A willful failure to observe the requirements of a statute made for the protection of the public will not be permitted to invalidate a contract. The courts will not permit the breach of duty to be set up as a defence. The statute is designed for the benefit of the public, and, if the public is not injured, the contractor cannot take advantage of the neglect of the officers to do their duty. The authority of the officers to enter into the contract is not affected by their failure to observe statutory requirements. The statute will not be permitted to be used as a shield for the protection of the officers, or as a sword for the destruction of the rights of the contractor. 3. The validity of the contract cannot be questioned by an officer whose duty it was to make the required certificate, but who deliberately failed to do so in order to escape liability on the contract.	1913	1901.8778

We had lost heavily; the Guards brigade and the 7th brigade had each lost over a third of their strength, and the lst and 2nd lines of the rifle regiments had each been reduced to a rear line, which could not be further drawn upon without disbanding the regiment. During the night I received a report from Colonel Von Kluck, commanding the Guard corps, stating that as a result of his afternoon bombardment of the fort at Monkham's Hall, and the fire of the corps on the British right, the fort appeared to be practically dismantled, and that the British centre was evidently weakening. He proposed therefore to commence an attack on the British right, to be supported by my advance at day break. I immediately sent him word to ask General Von Bock to give way to his proposal, and that I would open an attack shortly after daybreak on the British left, thus completing the envelopement of the British army, which was already beginning to waver. My move would force them to turn the principal attention of their left towards their right, and would at any rate give the appearance of a wide turning movement. I knew that if this was accomplished Von Kluck's corps would sweep through the British rear, and their left would completely dissolve, while mine would sweep into the city of London. This move was slow in maturing, and it was not until 8 a.m. on the following morning that I received confirmation from General Von Bock, who had been obliged to call a Council of War, which was dictated by the German constitution.	1906	1879.7775
In consequence of the manner in which the overstraining was done, and the fact that no considerable stress had been left on the specimen during the interval of unloading, the increase in yield point was very marked and the strain hardening resulted was very noticeable. It is evident that the application of this method for increasing the yield point is limited, it being necessary that the increase of load should be effected without the imposition of much stress during the interval of unloading and the reloading. There are, however, other methods for raising the yield point, two of which are: (a) The application of shock loads, as produced by hammering, rolling, or sudden impact of falling weights; and (b) The use of very high temperatures. (a) Shock Loads. — The effects of hammering and rolling are well known to raise the yield point, but the precise action is not at all understood. In the case of wrought iron the effect is well marked. This is illustrated by the following results obtained by Professor Ewing (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1890): Fig. 36 represents the planing tool used for removing 3/16 inch from the surface of the 12 inches x 1 inch shaft. Fig. 37 represents the planing tool used for removing 1/8 inch from the surface of the 5/8 inches diameter shaft and also for the 1 inch square bolt.	1908	1906.9395

Or does it whisper that in the matter of teaching nature, as in that of teaching languages, the method has been more important than the subject? I am by no means one of those who are ready to decry the results of the laboratory method in the teaching of biology. I have no doubt that the average pupil in the average school is better informed in the anatomy and physiology of his own body than he was twenty years ago. But I am sufficiently in touch with the world to know that few of this better informed average are any the better for the knowledge thus acquired. They have not been taught to connect it with the daily life in which the body plays so large a part.	1911	1928.515
It is only when there is a rough equality of power that the principle of self government can function and the ethical relationship be established. The subject race is then no longer a mere object for action, but an agent of action. Its will, not merely its welfare, is considered; and so long as it is loyal to the common interests its rights are recognised with as much care as is needed by the superior race. The good done is mutual. Not only is the subject race protected, but the superior race is protected from the deterioration which comes of doing everything for others, and of claiming from them and receiving no service in return. The development of the subject race is speedily matched by a development of the superior race, which, in respect of moral qualities, is even surer.	1908	1874.8339
And such a Pageant as that of London, repeating in a new form the story of the development of the metropolis and its neighbourhood, appeals powerfully not only to local but also to regional sentiment and interest. A study of such a Pageant, and of the social and civic influences which it has been shown to exercise, would form an appropriate introduction to an inquiry into the relations between local and regional sentiment. But the subject lies altogether outside the writer's immediate purpose and competence. That purpose, which is that of the present paper, is to survey the influence which the conception — or the reality — of regionalism has exercised upon some of the more prominent of our English provincial cities in their development during the last thirty years.	1908	1896.7596
"Finding that Stannard was in England, the judges took upon themselves the responsibility of summoning him, and he was condemned in default to pay a modest sum for so serious a charge as that of ""falsely accusing the Commandant M. Hagstrom."" The scissors and paste method of journalism is a very simple affair compared with that of the Congo ""authorities "" in connexion with this case. One or two anecdotes may be related which illustrate the way in which the native population is treated and the meaning of ""laws "" which are ""justly applied to all, without distinction of rank or race."" A party of six white hunters started from Boma in 1908, bound for the interior. Their object was large game, partly for sport and partly for the future use of the starving labour population. Before they had gone very far their path struck that of M. Stannard and his son and friend. This party had made an unsuccessful attempt to cross the Congo, and had turned back and followed the river bank northward. Father and sons travelled together for a time, and the white hunters and their retinue took up camp not far from the Stannard camp. By night some of the Congo porters stole into the white men's camp and stole various odds and ends, among them the Bible and hymn book of young W. Stannard."	1907	1906.4911
The decisions just referred to are not only shocking examples of judicial legislation, but they are also shocking examples of judicial partisanship. They give the lie to the boast of the law that all men are equal before it; for it is abundantly evident that if the defendants in these cases had been poor men, instead of the richest and most powerful corporations in the world, the penalties imposed would have been much more severe than those imposed on the corporations. These decisions are also shocking examples of judicial hypocrisy. They are in flagrant violation of that well established principle of constitutional law which forbids a court to pass upon the constitutionality of a law unless it is absolutely necessary to do so in order to dispose of the case before it.	1911	1927.0929
"On others, one is inclined to ask, •• Which truth ? "" I have enjoyed the articles, and I have been interested in the correspondence. I was particularly interested in the letter signed by •• A. W.1 Did you ever notice how different the views of people who are married and those of people who are not married ? I don't mean those who are ' ' engaged.' That is a state of mind by itself, and for the time being one that usually implies a certain amount of insanity. I mean people who are married. They seem to have come to the end of their tether. They have learned one truth — that they can't go back. They are hobbed minds. They have lost their individuality. They are parts of a machine, and they seem to expect, if they don't exactly wish, everybody else to be ground to the same pattern. If one of them dies, the other is like a broken cog. It is not that they cannot go forward. It is that they cannot go anywhere. They have lost all sense of direction. They were not made to be parts of a machine, and they know it. And yet they don't care to revert to the state of mind which preceded their marriage. They are not happy, but they are not unhappy. They are like the patient in the hospital who has been operated on for appendicitis, and who lies on his back staring at the ceiling. He is not enjoying life, but he is not unhappy."	1911	1881.1368
CHAPTER II. CHRISTIANITY AMONG THE ANGLO SAXONS. 1. THE CROSS IN THE WORK OF EARLY MISSIONARIES. The England to which Christian missionaries first came was inhabited by a people of Teutonic origin. Their history previous to the fifth century is of little concern to us, as it does not give us the background necessary for an understanding of their civilization after they had settled in Britain. It is enough to know that they were heathens, worshipping the Teutonic gods; that they had no literature, properly speaking, no written language, and no written code of law; that their government was in the hands of kings and chiefs, who ruled by power and might, and that their social structure was composed of a series of clans or tribes, each having its own chief, and bound together by ties of blood and loyalty. From time to time these tribes were united into larger divisions, or confederacies, by some strong ruler, and thus were formed the seven kingdoms into which England was divided at the time of the advent of Christianity, and which	1904	1883.496
(e) Persian or Indian group. This is a large group of smooth freestone peaches. The trees are hardy, of good vigorous growth. The fruit is large, fine quality, ripens early and is not subject to rot at the stone. Such peaches as Early Crawford, Late Crawford, Smock, Early Rose, Late Rose and Triumph belong to this group. 18  (f) Northern or Wisconsin group. This includes a few, hardy, cling peaches. The tree has small, narrow leaves and is of low growth. The peaches are small and of low quality. A few varieties of this group have been introduced into the Lake states and to some extent into the Northern part of the Central States. Several attempts have been made to classify peaches according to their season of ripening; but as there is much difference in the earliness and lateness of varieties according to locality, such classification has little permanent value and will not be attempted here. ORIGIN OF NEW VARIETIES. All varieties of peaches, as has been said, have originated either from seed or bud. New varieties have been produced by the natural crossing of the pollen from one tree with the pistil of another. These new combinations may be produced by planting seeds from such fruit. Most of our new varieties are produced, however, by artificial cross pollination, or by the selection of one branch for budding, or by the selection of one tree on which the fruit is allowed to mature.	1914	1927.382
"As much as what you say, "" answered Mrs. Peppercorn, with her little giggle.

"8–30 mm. long. (Fletcher.) A small frog of very unfroglike appearance, that at once suggests mccoy's Homophrynus. In fact its position here is a little doubtful, and it may eventually have to be placed near the rather remarkable genus Limnodynastes, of which we have at present but one representative (L. ornatus). So far I have been able to find but one specimen of this little frog, and that was collected by the Rev. J. D. Milligan, near Mount Gambier, in the south east of the Province. Mr. Merrin, however, informs me that the species is not uncommon in that district. I have also received from Mr. Milligan a few specimens of another small frog, which, judging from his description, appears to be referable to the same form. "" A small frog, 8–30 mm. long, with the subgular vocal sacs in the male, and the peculiar skull structure."" (Fletcher.)

"The need of the guards indicates the weakness of the cause they are supposed to sustain. A few weeks later, when the cotton season opened, it was discovered that the labourers on this estate were demanding one dollar a day and their meals. For many years they have received but forty cents a day and ""found."" The owner and his heirs have had, of course, to suffer the loss of a large number of tenants and a very large portion of their cotton crop. Other estates in the same neighbourhood have also suffered, but a number of the smaller ones, where the need of continual supervision is less, and where the old relation has not been so entirely broken, have prospered. Many of the larger estates, where the management has been most arbitrary and harsh, have not yet realised that the days when the negro was simply a field hand are over. They are still trying to force conditions by the use of the weapon which has been so effective in the past. The strike, which was quite general over the entire South, took place because the cotton crop was eight weeks late. Rain in May, when the cotton was ready to be ploughed, made it impossible to prepare the ground for planting. The owners of most of the larger estates are still ignorant of cotton growing and farming in general. They do not know that the most important factor in the labour problem is the labourer's knowledge of the value of his work, or of what he ought to receive for it, and the knowledge which comes from organisation. They will learn, as the owners of the small plantations have had to learn, that the labourer is not a mere animal, but a man."	1913	1893.7418
For instance, the blue of the sky, the blue of the sea, and similar blues, are recorded as grey; a cerise red, however, is recorded as cerise. The blue is omitted as being difficult of reproduction in the motion pictures themselves, and the other shades of blue are recorded as grey. Kinemacolor pictures are, as a rule, more pleasing than other coloured pictures, and the process has many advantages over the ordinary coloured pictures. While colour photography has been known for many years, it was not until the last few years that it has been practicable to produce moving pictures in colours, and it is only during the past year or so that the Kinemacolor motion pictures have come into popular favour. The Kinemacolor motion pictures are made up of a series of pictures, each one of which, though it may be only a fraction of a second in duration, is photographed separately.	1912	1900.4677
"She had no idea that her son was in any way interested in the young lady. She had attributed his late restlessness to the absence of the rest of the family, and to the fact that, as he had told her, he had nothing to do. And she had been happy to see him again. He was always so cheerful and so good tempered. A little too cheerful, perhaps. She had a vague idea that he was taking too much exercise and too much fresh air, now that he was convalescent. He had ridden every day, and had taken long walks. She had noticed, too, that he was out late at night, and that he had begun to smoke cigarettes again. These things, however, she passed over. She was glad to see him looking so well, and so much himself. They were at sea near Scarborough, when Marcia's fate was sealed. Lady Coryston had her son to herself on deck, and she broached the subject of the young lady. The young lady's name, as she had expected, was known to him.

With the majority of plates used by amateurs, and with almost every camera outfit on the market, this is the one thing to be avoided. The amateur should never develop by time, but by inspection. Use a weak developer at first, and increase the strength as the subject requires. If you see the shadows coming out too strong, stop the development by putting the plate in the fixing bath, and, after it is fixed, immerse it in an acid hypo bath (see formula) for ten minutes. This will clear the shadows, and the negative will be all right. Negatives that are too dense can be cleared by giving just a short immersion in the above bath, but not too long, or the plate will be spotty.  In taking portraits use a stop of at least 1/8 to 1/4 second. Anything less will give a tendency to lack of definition. If desired, you can use a small stop. WHITISH SULPHUR SPRINGS. 12 Of course, at this speed you will have the subject hold the head perfectly still, or use a head rest. If you have a good camera and good rapid plates, you can get good results in the simplest kind of a studio, using an ordinary gas jet or incandescent lamp. In making a single portrait you can put the subject in any position or attitude desired if the head is held still, or a rest is used.	1912	1910.2921
If a steel rod 1 cm. in diameter and 100 cm. long is stretched 1 mm. in length by a pulling force, what is the intensity of the stress?

"Massarelli, in his admirable course of lectures on the ""Technical Side of Lighting"" delivered at the School of Engineering and Navigation in Salerno, devotes no fewer than four volumes to the subject. The possibilities of light are still far from being exhausted. We are all familiar with the remarkable discoveries of the last few years in connection with incandescent and fluorescent lamps, with the new ""carbide lamps, "" and with the ""Swan lamps"" which, I understand, are now being manufactured in Italy. The invention of sending forth a beam of light in a concentrated form from an ordinary incandescent lamp by the use of a parabolic reflector is also quite a recent innovation, and it is no exaggeration to say that in the near future we shall have lamps of every conceivable colour, and lamps of all degrees of intensity, and capable of being focussed or diffused at will."	1912	1899.1105
"The sage, without changing his expression, calls for a chariot to be brought in. As soon as it appears he points out that it is made up of separate parts — the wheels, the body, the pole, etc. — and asks the Greek whether he would say that the chariot is the wheels, or the body, or any of the other parts. ""No, bhante, "" he answers, ""the chariot is none of these."" ""And yet, "" says the sage, ""the chariot is not more than the Nagasena, the man, is these parts of his body."" The Greek is still not satisfied, and insists that, as the chariot is not less than the wheels, so the man cannot be less than the parts of which he is composed. The sage then has the wheels and other parts taken apart and placed on the floor, and asks the Greek what that is which is in the chariot. The Greek admits that it is the parts of which the chariot is made. ""And yet, "" says the sage, ""the chariot is not more than the Nagasena, the man, is these parts of his body."" The Greek is still not satisfied, and insists that, as the chariot is not less than the wheels, so the man cannot be less than the parts of which he is composed.

And in this face, as in that of the Abbe, the light is a light of the sky, not the light of the lamp. It is the light of the inner sun, of the sun that does not set. It is the light which has its own quality, which you may find in the eyes of many a poor old woman in the slums of London, who has lived for God and for her neighbour, and has never heard of Cardinal Newman. In the portrait, too, the eyes are the most significant feature. They are the eyes of a seer, eyes that seem to have been opened after blindness, to have looked on the Eternal and returned to earth only to see the Eternal in all earthly things.	1913	1889.7773
But the game is a splendid one, and he revels in it. Besides, his fellow players are kind to him and help him all they can. They know that he is out for sport, and not for pay, and they respect him for that. They feel that his heart is in it, and they like to have him in their midst. 353 The Rugby Football Club at Victoria West, Cape Colony. Of course, our hero has gone through the mill in a preliminary initiation, and most of the rites of that ceremony have been of a nature to make him feel both sore and sorry. But all that is over now, and he is a member of the club and one of its most valued players. His captain, who is a good fellow, and to whom he has taken a great fancy, is continually telling him that he is already one of the best players in the team, and that if he only had the same luck in the matter of size and pounds avoirdupois as he has in the matter of skill and cleverness, he would be a second William Milton. But then, of course, he is only five feet five and a bit in his shoes, and weighs but nine stone or thereabout. Hence he is classed as a forward, and the biggest in the pack, too, for in this respect, as in most others, he is a veritable 'little go' among 'big goes.' He is not the only one of his kind in the club, however, for there are three or four others who are as light and as short as he is, and who are known as the 'little forwards' of the team.	1908	1901.1622
"You should know what that means. It means that many farmers will be ruined, and a number of shopkeepers also. A number of the farmers near here were shareholders in the bank. I have just received a letter from my brother-in-law, Johannes Steyn, imploring me to go immediately to the city and return with some one who has influence and can induce Herr Von Luttwitz to consent to a compromise.

In so far as the taxing authority should be enabled to distinguish between the present and the future increases in values, it would be applying the single tax principle only to the present increases. The future increases would be left untouched by the application of the single tax principle. All taxes on the future increases would be deferred until the time of the increase, and, as a matter of fact, the future increases would be likely to be taxed only in part, and perhaps not at all. For, if the taxing authority should be able to apply the principle of taxation to the future increases, it would be able, too, to exempt from taxation certain future increases, the ones that were most likely to be large, and could discriminate against others of less likelihood of being large.	1911	1941.0011
"The gardener's face was that of a man who has been listening to an elaborate and absurd jest. His eyes were narrowed, his lips were pursed. ""I don't believe a word of it!"" he said curtly. ""Then you are a fool!"" replied Dr. Farquhar. ""And I am a fool for wasting my time and breath on you!"" ""What is it you say you found?"" asked the gardener. ""I told you — a scrap of paper."" ""And you say it was hidden away in the Bible?"" ""Yes."" ""And you say it was written by my wife?"" ""Yes."" ""And you say it was written before she married me?"" ""Yes."" ""And you say it is a confession of — of — "" ""Of her infatuation for another man."" The gardener's face was still that of a man who did not believe, but who was beginning to be impressed. ""What does it say?"" he asked. ""It says that she loved him — that she married you to save her honour — that she never loved you and never could love you."" ""And you believe it?"" ""I do not believe it; I know it."" ""How do you know it?"" ""I found it."" ""Where?"" ""In the Bible."" ""And you brought it here to me?"" ""No."" ""Then where is it?"" ""I burnt it."" The gardener rose. ""I don't believe a word of your yarn!"" he said. ""The woman I married never had anything to do with another man!"	1913	1933.7103
"His face was convulsed, his lips moved, his eyes rolled in their orbits; it was evident that his last thought was the consciousness of his crimes, and that he felt himself overwhelmed by their weight. Then his features resumed their tranquillity; his limbs were no longer agitated; his eyes closed, and the soul, escaping from the body, doubtless went to seek its expiation in the infernal regions. As soon as the tyrant was dead, the people hastened to deliver the virtuous and unfortunate Olympe. They ran to the prison, broke down the doors, and carried her in triumph to the Temple. She was received there with every mark of love and veneration. The next day she made her entrance into the Convention, seated in a chair of state, and surrounded by her friends. The President, in a loud voice, proclaimed her the Goddess of Liberty, and the Convention rose up to do her honour. The people, to celebrate the fall of the tyrant, made a grand festival, which lasted three days. They erected a monument to Liberty, on which was inscribed: ""Liberty, the daughter of Nature, was born in the forests of Germany, and was nourished in France in the bosom of the laws. The tyrant who wished to stifle her in her cradle was chastised by Heaven. The people restored to her the rights of which she had been robbed."""	1912	1871.6799
"They found it possible to dispense with a rudder, the lateral control being effected entirely by the wing warping. 2. Winter, ""' Fighter "" Type R.E.P.

This type is particularly intended for fighting and observation purposes, where an ability to manoeuvre rapidly and effectively is of paramount importance. The speed, though not notably high, is sufficient for all ordinary purposes, and the aeroplane is particularly easy to fly. 68. Construction. — The wings are built up entirely of Ash and spruce. For the leading edge an elliptical outline is adopted. The ribs are also of this shape; they have a depth of 5 in. at mid span, tapering to 3 in. at the tips. The wing spars are made stronger towards the centre of the span than at the ends. The rear spar is made slightly thicker than the front spar; both are made of two pieces of spruce 1 in. x 3 in. No. i wing has six main ribs and five half ribs. The half ribs are placed at 1| and 2| ft. from the leading edge, and are below a stainless steel tube, which serves as an extra spar. The gap is of course supported by similar ribs, and the rear spars of both wings are joined by i in. x 2 in."	1912	1917.362
The life hardships which urban trees bear are, in most cases, avoidable. If the space allowed the trees for roots and the care given them when young were but doubled, the trees would be healthier and much less expensive to the city. But money is not the main consideration. A tree is a priceless possession. In the park of every industrial city and in every city of fair size should be established arboreta in which our native and foreign trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, in their various forms, should grow side by side for the instruction of the people and the pleasure of the artist and photographer. Such a collection of trees and shrubs is the Arnold Arboretum, located in a part of Boston called Jamaica Plain. This consists of about 260 acres of land, owned by the city of Boston, but used by Harvard University as an experimental garden and arboretum. Its founder, Mr. Arnold, began the collection with a few trees, and it has been enlarged mainly through the generosity of many men and women who enjoy trees, shrubs, and flowers. The specimens are grouped according to their botanical classification, and a label attached to each one gives its name, its native country, and the name of the donor, or the name of the man or woman in whose memory it was planted. The Arnold Arboretum is a collection typical of the best arboretum in the world, for there are many such collections in England and in Germany, but in the United States there are only three or four worthy of the name.	1911	1923.619
"The greatest difficulty was found in keeping the planet in the field of the telescope, which is so small that only one star can be seen in it at a time, and the planet moves away in a few seconds as the Earth rotates. ""At the time of opposition, Mars is about 140 million miles away, and an image of the planet on a plate 12 inches by 10 inches is about the size of a pinhead. "" These photographs are sure to be ridiculed, but I can't help it. I am bound to say that so far I have not noticed any lines of the character which Mr. Wells mentions, nor have I been told of any by Mr. Percival Lowell, who has examined them very carefully."	1911	1898.5919
Elliott's own vessel, the Niagra, was in line and supported the Lawrence until the first of the Lawrence's guns were silenced; but after that, without Perry's order, she drew out of the line, and, making a long detour, was brought up on the starboard side of the Lawrence, and, in that position, Perry himself, with one of his men, hoisted the flag of the Niagra, and Perry's own flag, on the poop deck, out of the reach of the enemy's fire. This act was not done until after Perry had taken the flag from the Lawrence and had gone on board the Niagra. It is not known that any one on the Niagara, except her commander, knew that the commodore had transferred his flag from the Lawrence to the Niagra.	1913	1887.8142
But the project for a railway to the Jura failed, and Berne saw itself forced to accept a concession to the independent construction of a narrow gauge railway from the Emmental to Olten, running through the Jura, and to relinquish all hope of a direct connection with the Aare. The new line, built by private enterprise, was opened to Wichtrach in 1875. The last years of Stockmar's active life were spent in securing for the city the construction, through a railroad of the Federal system, of a route, going around the ridges of the Emmental, to the Aare at Wichtrach. On March 6, 1893, he passed away, just as the ultimate solution of the long sought for problem, to which he had devoted so much energy and devotion, seemed about to be realized. The new line, which in 1895 connected the Aare and the Emme, was provided with a station for the goods traffic at Wichtrach, and thus his ideal was realized that every city of the canton should possess a station of the Federal railroads. When the Franco Prussian war broke out in 1870, and the Kingdom of Prussia, which had fought long and bravely for freedom and unity in Germany, now sought to bring about the unification of Germany under the hegemony of Prussia, it was felt by many Swiss that under certain circumstances their own country might be forced to take sides in a struggle between the great Teutonic powers.	1911	1892.275

The story of such a canal is in its peace. Its very immobility is its charm. It suggests, in this hurry - ing age of railways and electric cars, an eternal, if leisurely, life. Rushing man seems to have left it to its own contemplative existence ; he seems to have in some fit of abstraction forgotten its very existence, and to have gone hurrying on to his own destruction. It has a delightfully monastic air. The wind may ruffle its surface ; the rain may pelt it ; clouds may scud and storm about it ; the sun may go down in a rage ; yet there is something unconquerably placid in its attitude and demeanour. It is unapproachable by any of the emotions that effect the human landscape.	1913	1893.6138
"""I approached the door. The drover bowed to me. I bowed in return. The drover then addressed me, saying, 'Sir, I have had the honour to wait upon you.' I bowed again. 'I am a sheep dealer, ' continued the drover, and hearing that you required a supply of mutton I hastened to place a small sample before you.' 'Sample?' I groaned. 'Why, there is no sampler in the world who would presume to offer for sale a sheep with a broken leg. Remove the animal at once!' ""The drover did not appear to be in the least disconcerted by my outburst. He raised his stick and pointed it towards the sheep. 'Rufus, ' said he, 'remove yourself.' ""The sheep, which had been gazing vacantly at me during the whole of this idiotic conversation, turned slowly about and waddled away down the street."	1913	1920.9806
The rapid decrease in the number of indentured servants after 1715, together with the growing demand for labour in the Southern colonies, led to the importation of negro slaves on a large scale, and thus began the course of economic development which culminated in the almost complete disappearance of white servitude and the establishment of the system of negro slavery. At the close of the colonial period, the institution of slavery was the only one existing in America. The white servant had disappeared. The negro slave was the only person in the New World who performed service under conditions of compulsory labour. The present system of free labour developed from this foundation of compulsory labour. We have already pointed out that the colonial period had produced no classes.	1913	1924.8678
"How can the rejected men, especially those with a permanent disability like amputation, be reeducated to useful civilian life? How can the standard of fitness, both physical and mental, be raised? How, in short, can the slogan of the National Physical Culture Association, "" Fit to fight, fit to work, fit to live,"" be made to ring through the land? Woman's share in the answer to this problem is both important and complicated. Of course the first thought of many is that the fight has been won, and that it is now man's turn to fit himself. This is true, but only in a limited sense. The Woman's Committee of the Council of National Defence, which is the War Work Council of the YVomen of the United States, has taken over from the United States Public Health Service the work of raising the standard of health and fitness in the homes of America."	1908	1982.0707
"Plate i i i . any plate as no two are ever alike. I began doing this with plate No. 1, and now, after many years, at No. 3822. When I make a print from a plate, I set the number in the lower right hand corner of the print, so that it can be seen through the window of an album, and then catalog the print in the record book. I have several such books, each devoted to a different size of negative. The record for each print contains the following items: Size of print; date printed; number of positive; date negative was made; number of negative; subject; and remarks. Under remarks I note such information as printing frame used, exposure, developer, any special treatment, if I take a second print, and so on. This is a record I advise every amateur to keep; it usually involves only a few minutes' work on every print, and is often invaluable to one who desires to duplicate a print or obtain information as to how this or that result was accomplished. I review the record book, now and then, and make remarks on my technique, such as ""add 30 grains of metol to 10 ounces of developer, "" or "" increase time of immersion in water before development to four minutes."" I have mentioned before that I never hesitate to use a negative more than once, or, at times, to make two or more prints at a time from a single negative. I sometimes think of a good subject for a stereo print after the plate has been used for a 5x7 negative or a 4xo print, and with the clear area on the plate, all around the semi-transparent subject, as a guide, it is a simple matter to"	1912	1884.5137
On our way to the Lake', he writes, ' we passed a very sickly looking young elephant, which was being driven by three others. The poor creature evidently could not keep up to the rest, and every now and then was roughly pushed on from behind. It fell over, and lay for some time, panting; then it got up again, and went through the same performance, the three maintaining their cruel conduct. I could not stand this, and asked the chief why they did not help the poor thing, or drive it away from the herd. He said they had no power over it, and that the strong ones were doing their duty in trying to help it; but I was not satisfied, and ordered one of my men to shoot it, which he did.' 1 Later on, the chief explained that the elephant was sick and going to die, and that, in spite of the cruel action of the younger ones, it would be better for the herd to leave it alone, as if	1908	1873.0902
I would give the Syndicalists my blessing if I had any to spare, but I have none. I would make them a present of a cigaret if I were not a Teetotaler. But I think they are utterly mistaken in their tactics. If they were to go on strike, and if by going on strike they could bring about a great calamity, and if the calamity were to result in the restoration of the old regime of individualism, I should be with them in spirit. But, as a matter of fact, the strike is a weapon which is losing its terror, and it is a weapon which is being used too much. It is like the lion's roar in the nursery tale. At first it terrifies the children, and then they grow used to it, and at last they laugh at it.	1911	1894.7113
It is the modern industrial conditions that make the heritage of the race a burden instead of a blessing. The artists and the poets in their several degrees are the men and women who come into touch with their elementary nature, who respond to the call of the beautiful in the world. But even the artist is not always free from the blight of the industrial routine. To the man who is sensitive to the beauty of Nature, to the beauty of the arts, the modern industrial life of the West is a sad spectacle. The artist is often a mere unit in the machine, and his sensibility is dulled by its grind. The poet is sometimes a drudge, and the thing that he writes is a product, not of the Muse, but of the market.	1913	1931.0375
And this way lies through humility, through idealism, through patience, through effort, through moral earnestness, through self abandonment, through love. We are aided or hindered on this way by things external and by ourselves. In our external environment there are guiding stars and walling mountains, and in ourselves there are spirit and flesh; and all these are forces. The path is straight and short; but to the wayfarers it seems, through ignorance of the direct influence of the forces, long and perilous. For the way is beset by doubts, discouragements, mistakes, and errors. But when we have reached the reality, the return to the path of  the wayfarer is easy; for we have the gold standard, by which to distinguish, as values in the same universal currency, the smaller experiences, the less valuable but necessary attainments.	1913	1882.7281
The crowd was not large, the street was not particularly dirty, and it was a Saturday afternoon, when the population of the more respectable portion of the community were enjoying a holiday in the parks. The figure, whether man or woman, did not seem to be going anywhere in particular, except straight ahead, and the crowd followed it, keeping a respectful distance, and watching it with that mixture of curiosity and contempt with which a London crowd always regards drunkenness. It was not until this figure had turned the corner, and faced the westering sun, that the looser portions of the garments, which swayed with every unsteady movement of the wearer, fell away from the features concealed in the dingy, torn upturned collar of the overcoat, revealing the pale, delicate face of a girl.	1911	1865.341
"This concentration is made possible by the completion of the Emden Canal, which connects the Elbe with the Jade, and thus shortens the route from Hamburg to Wilhelmshaven. The German Fleet consists of 36 ""Dreadnought"" and ""Dreadnought"" type battleships, 17 armoured cruisers, 36 protected cruisers, 43 torpedo boat destroyers, and 138 torpedo boats. This year, however, the German naval authorities have been pleading for an increase in the number of ""Dreadnoughts"" to be built. They claim that the present programme of 41 ""Dreadnoughts"" by 1917 is insufficient, and that the number should be increased to 49. The German ""Dreadnoughts"" are all built at the Imperial Dockyards. The ""Dreadnought"" type battleships are built at Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, while the older types are built at Danzig and Cuxhaven. The armoured cruisers are built at Danzig and Cuxhaven. The protected cruisers are built at Danzig, Cuxhaven, and Stettin. Torpedo boat destroyers are built at Stettin, Kiel, Cuxhaven, and Danzig, while the torpedo boats are built at Stettin, Cuxhaven, Danzig, and Wilhelmshaven. The German naval authorities have recently been pleading for the establishment of a dockyard at Bremen, which would be of great advantage, as it would be near the works of the Bremen Steel Company, the largest in Germany, and the one which produces the greatest quantity of steel suitable for naval purposes."	1907	1940.7238
"But when she started for her own apartment, he leaped up and rushed to the door. ""My love, it is the Barracks, "" he cried, ""and the soldiers must carry thee. I cannot, I cannot!"" She looked back at him from the stairs. ""With a dozen soldiers, my Paul?"" she asked. ""Then go!"" he called, and she fled. The morning light had come, but Paul, lying back among the pillows, saw it not. He was conscious only of one thing — his happiness was now complete! His wife was with him. He smiled through his tears when he thought of the old fear that had tortured him. Perry's letter had fallen into the water and been lost, and he had not read it, nor even seen it! And because of that She had not blamed him! Oh, this was bliss! His heart was singing a song of its own, just as it had sung in the old, old days of the early love. It broke the stillness with soft murmurs of joy, and when his loved one entered he smothered her with kisses. The haunting sadness that had hung over his wife during all the morning seemed utterly to have vanished now. She began to talk with vivacity, and to laugh with the lightness of heart that had once charmed him. Paul laughed with her, but in his recesses he was just a little worried by the rapidity with which she was changing from a mood of deep melancholy to one of wild gaiety. He remembered, with a smile, the way she had changed after she had heard the news of her uncle's death."	1909	1925.7028
And he, Von Kronhelm, would carry them out to the letter. Dawn broke, and the little army, sullen and angry, threaded its way through the narrow streets. The column had progressed only a little way when it met with a defence that surprised even the hardened Prussians. The people, at first uncertain, had suddenly realised their plight, and women, old men, and boys opposed their advancing foe. The women flung scalding water from the windows. Hot pitch and red hot coal from the fires were thrown down. Fierce and grim, the sullen civilians fought for their homes and their children. They had no weapons but their fists and their courage, and so long as they had these they would be true to their trust. But, in spite of their bravery, it was a forlorn hope. The sturdy citizen could not stand against the armed soldier. Onward the troops pressed, trampling down the defenders of the homes. Many of the soldiers were sickened by the sight, and cursed the orders that had driven them thus through the streets of London, so they beat down the fans of resistance by force of superior numbers. But the road, strewn with the bodies of men, women, and children, bore witness to the ferocity of the soldiers. Such orders had never been given in the advance through Belgium, and the Empress Ludovica turned pale as she watched the melancholy procession from her balcony.	1906	1914.9879
"— J. B. de L."" (See Ch. Lair, Le Musee de Chantilly, i. 133.) 60 in the spirit of the picture to be seen in the Warwickshire Museum. It has been pointed out that this picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1767, and that Walpole in his catalogue notes that it was a copy by the artist himself, "" done in a more careful manner, as M. Carmontelle said, than the original."" 1 We need not linger over the small collection of Garrick's portraits, which, even to the present day, is so singularly wanting in interest. It would have been something had the famous picture by Reynolds been included in it, yet, strange to say, the most famous of all Garrick's portraits was painted after his likeness had passed from Reynolds's memory."	1912	1870.9374
I was sorely tempted to strike him, for I felt he had betrayed me ; but I could see he was acting in my best interests, so I calmed myself, and told the men I would go with them, but it was under protest. They assured me I should be treated with every consideration, and that I should be given a room to myself, and every possible comfort. The man who had been sent to me, and who had only been waiting in the hall, now took charge of me, and the other two went away. I was put into a closed cab, and the man sat beside me. We drove for about a mile, and then stopped at a large house, standing in the middle of a park. 	1911	1882.2928
This route later became of great moment, for by the mouth of the Adur entered many of those fleets which under the successive monarchs of Denmark ravaged southern Britain. It was to this mouth that Harold sent a message to the Norwegian king upon the eve of Hastings. Further history changed the character of the coastwise traffic, for in the twelfth century pirates began to issue from the mouths of the Seine, and Southampton, in consequence of its proximity to the Norman ports, became the principal station in which were collected the ships to guard the southern coast, 11 and in whose haven were many of the vessels which Joan of Arc had seen and designed to capture. But although this “ Port of Hampten ” was well fitted to command the passage of the Solent and to guard the western gap in the chalk ramparts of the Downs, the great gap in this rampart, with its base at the triple jaws of the Adur, was little guarded, for Hastings, from its mud bottom, was no good harbour for the shipping then in use. The one port on the southern coast which might have been expected to take this duty upon itself is the little haven of Shoreham, which, lying three miles above the sea, now has behind it a town of 6,000 inhabitants, but in the fourteenth century was a place of considerable traffic. It appears somewhat strangely in the list of the Cinque Ports, a grouping whose original object was the guarding of the coast, but which, when the character of the traffic changed, had become one of justice and privilege. To this group Shoreham belongs under the name of its member “ Falaise.”	1912	1881.542
"As Miss Maud Arnott said at a meeting in the King's Hall, Covent Garden, on March 18th, 1912, in reply to a man who had asked her, "" What would they do with the vote ? "" ""They would vote for a better world, or at least a better England, and leave the rest to the men!"" The idea seems to be that women, being by nature more benevolent and humanitarian than men, will by their votes lead their more selfish brothers to become benevolent and humanitarian also, and that the world will then be all that could be desired. This is a very pretty theory, but it is not very logical, and as a matter of fact women have never yet used any power they have had to make laws or enforce penalties to improve the world, or even their own country."	1911	1902.7845
Some men might prefer the incandescent lighting effect, but, as a whole, the men did not. They got much better diffused lighting effect with the inverted arc lamp. Mr. J. M. Stainer, Greaves, England, asked if the author was still using Bleriot lamps for arc diffused lighting. He knew that in some factories Bleriot lamps had been discarded for other makes. Mr. Swinburne replied that he was still using Bleriot lamps as well as other lamps, and he had found no difference in the duration of the lamp and the carbon rods making the same number of hours. With regard to the new form of lamp to which the author referred, it had been stated that the new 404 form of lamp was handier than the Bleriot lamp.	1912	1921.1102

BOOK AND PAMPHLET The law has been from the beginning that a book may consist of a single sheet, and this, according to the latest decisions, includes broadsides and circulars, as well as leaflets and printed slips. The law does not require that a book contain more than one sheet or leaf of paper, but there must be printed matter on both sides, and if the one sheet consists of two leaves or sheets, they must be attached so as to constitute one continuous sheet. As the law does not require more than one sheet or leaf of paper, it is obvious that printed forms are as much entitled to protection as any other leaflet or circular. This was clearly spelled out in the case of The Chicago Iconograph Co. v. Heller, decided in 1891. The complainant published and sold chromatic forms, and claimed to have registered them as a book. The defendant used a form precisely like it, and the complainant asked for an injunction. The defendant did not deny the infringement of the complainant's form, but he claimed that it was not copyrightable, as a matter of law, and therefore no infringement was possible. The court held in favour of the complainant and said: “But it is urged that this form was not a copyrightable book.	1913	1904.7816
"It is somewhat carnivorous, and feeds not only on vegetable matter, bul also on small fish, mollusca, and aquatic insects; in fact, ""anything that comes between its jaws."" Even other Catfish are devoured, the young of the species falling victims to the larger one. Mr. D. O'Connor has kept it along with Goldfish, and reports that it was quite peaceable towards them, while the Goldfish in their turn behaved most inhospitably towards the Catfish, constantly irritating it by their inquisitive movements. (Fig. 20.) Fishes of the Carp Kind. — These are represented in the Nile by several species of Barbus, which belong to the genus of Carp or Cyprinoid fishes most widespread over the earth. They are met with not only in Europe and Western Asia, but also in Africa and India. They have usually an elongated, spindle-shaped body, the scales are large and hard, the fins pointed, the mouth small and provided with four whisker like feelers. The number of rays in the anal fin is usually greater than that in the dorsal fin. Most species are of lively and restless habits, and they mostly live in shoals. The Nile contains a number of species belonging to the genus of Carps, but most of them have not yet been satisfactorily described. The best known arc the B. niloticus, c npsephus, and bynni, while F. lugubris is also sometimes classed with them."	1909	1911.3523
"The hunter's sense of distance is sometimes at fault, and he misses his aim. The rifle is the weapon most in use, because the eye of the Opossum is not well adapted for throwing back light, and very often the hunter is simply guided by the movement of the animal's ear, and fires, and often misses, at the head. It is also necessary for the hunter to be very careful not to shoot his dog, which would be a great calamity, for an Opossum would hardly be worth the wasting of a good dog."" The following description of the Opossum hunt, and a Southern gentleman's letter in regard to it (both taken from a charming little book called ""Wild Animals I have Known""), are so graphic that we take great pleasure in introducing them into our chapter: ""An Opossum hunt, with the hounds baying below the huge tree in which the frightened animal is crouched, and the moon throwing a silvery light over the scene, is a very pretty picture, although perhaps not as thrilling as the actual pursuit of a deer,"	1909	1873.7926

It is only a question of a few details for the publication of the works of the Baron d'Holbach. We must be careful to keep the names of the authors secret. See that no letters remain in the works, and so on. But I am glad of one thing, and that is that you have finished your portrait of the Abbe Raynal. I am delighted with it, and I hope that you will be completely satisfied with it too. There is a great deal of difference between the portrait of the Abbe Raynal, and that of the Marquis de Condorcet ; but the two paintings are equally good. To tell the truth, I do not think that Raynal has had much happiness in his life. He has had to fight with many enemies. He has lost his friend and protector d'Holbach, who died in January of this year (1789).	1912	1859.8563
"The English position was magnificent, and it was a matter of deep regret to me that the brave fellows should be compelled to sacrifice themselves in such a hopeless cause. "" The 7th and 8th Divisions, which had made such a glorious advance the day before, were now completely exhausted by the previous day's fighting and by the terrible heat, and they were entirely unable to make any further attack. I saw General von Kluck about this time. He was in an extraordinary state of excitement, and rushed about from group to group of his Generals and Colonels, and from battery to battery, shouting for fresh attacks. He ordered all the reserve artillery to be brought up, and the howitzers were put into action with a terrible effect. """	1906	1869.6241
"In Germany archceological and philological study have received a powerful impetus from the discovery that ancient monuments of language, society, law and custom which were long dismissed as illusory, sub fect to easy disproof in the study of ancient literature, survive in the modern folkways. Carlyle and Muirhead have shown us how much we can learn about the Teutonic home, about Scandinavian Norway, and about the Germanic peoples in middle and later ages from survivals in our own folkways, and how by the method of comparison, adequate because of the archseological finds, we may establish the reconstruction of thought and theory in an imaginary age. Hitherto Germanic, Teutonic or primitive Eng lish studies have proceeded along independent lines, and have made little or no attempt to correlate their results with facts established in the study of Old Celtic languages and customs. Professor G. P. Gooch, in a short and scholarly essay, "" The Origin of the English Language,"" has been the first, so far as I know, to correlate the results of Germanic and Celtic studies. His paper is a worthy introduction to the study of Celtic influences on English, but it is too short to do more than outline a wide and complex subject. Mr. Chadwick's disquisition on "" The National Life in Early English Literature "" should be read in connexion with Professor Gooch's essay."	1908	1928.5669

It is not the home that is lacking in organisation; it is the home that is lacking in co — operation. We have all the organisation that we need. We have the home; we have the family; we have the time. The only thing that we lack is the spirit of co — operation. Co — operation is the great need of the home. It is the spirit of co — operation that makes the home a unit, that gives it solidarity, that makes it a real organisation. Co — operation is the heart of all organisation. It is the thing that gives life to the organisation. It is the thing that makes the organisation a unit. Without co — operation there is no organisation. With co — operation there is organisation, and all that is needed is the spirit of co — operation to make that organisation a perfect unit. The home is the model organisation for the world. It is the organisation that is nearest to the ideal. It is the organisation that has the greatest possibility of development. It is the organisation that has the greatest opportunity for the exercise of the spirit of co — operation. The home is the best school for the teaching of the spirit of co — operation. It is the only organisation in which we are born into the spirit of co — operation. It is the only organisation that is not artificial. It is the only organisation that is natural. It is the only organisation that has been instituted by the Creator. It is the only organisation that has been instituted by the Creator for the teaching of the spirit of co — operation.	1911	1930.5609
"The first chapter opens with a quotation from Smith's "" Theory of Moral Sentiments "" to the effect that the man who is not distressed by the misfortunes of his neighbours has not yet reached the full measure of humanity. In the second chapter the author shows that the first duty of the sovereign is to enable the people to maintain themselves by the cultivation of the soil. The third chapter treats of the laws of the sovereign which are designed to protect the poor against the oppression of the rich. The fourth chapter deals with the duty of the state to furnish the people with the means of education. The fifth chapter shows that the real aim of the industrial system is to increase the productive power of labour, which is simply another name for the power to work, and that the aim of the worker is to increase his power to enjoy."	1908	1911.9263
The new powder is put up in the familiar Victor red and gold cartons and is sold in the same sizes as the old powder. A word to the wise is sufficient. A New All Black, Opaque, and Light Tight Developing Tank A developing tank in which both daylight and artificial light can be used has long been desired by both amateur and professional workers. The new tank — No. 2 — just placed on the market by the Imperial Tank Company, 425 West 39th street, New York, is made in one piece and is absolutely light tight. No changing of the films is required and the tank will hold any number of films, no matter how large. The films are held in position by means of a spiral, and so that the films may be easily slipped on or off the spiral, there is a little lever on the side of the tank which, when pressed down, automatically releases the spiral. The tank is made of heavy metal, and on this account, all chemical solutions can be used in it without danger of injuring the tank. It can be had for either 4 x5 or 5 x7 films, and costs but $4.50. The tank is shown in the illustration on this page. For further particulars see advertisement on another page. A New Light Tight Developing Tank	1912	1943.3331
A C M 's A 222  While I expressed some doubt as to whether their innate self respect would prove a sufficient safeguard against their being misled into such acts, I could not help feeling that there was a good deal of truth in her observation, and that the majority of Earth women, though blessed with some self respect, would be less likely to indulge in a process from which they were certain to be excluded, if they belonged to a planet where the right to vote was accorded them as a matter of course. It is natural that in passing a Martian abode, I should feel an intense desire to know more regarding the social and political customs of the race; yet I am sometimes almost afraid to indulge this desire by asking questions, lest I should be educated up to ideas which must afterward prove unsatisfactory.	1911	1903.1351
In order to be steerable, some instabilities of the control forces must be deliberately made, and the problem of achieving success consists in balancing the desirable movements due to the control by the forces due to the I instability. In this connection it is to be noted that the instabilities or lack of stability desirable are of two kinds. They are chiefly those which are necessary in order that the control surface should act, the very small forces necessary to overcome friction, inertia of the mechanism, etc. Secondly, when the control surface is acting, certain instabilities are required in order that the surface may cause a change of attitude. The desirable instabilities are usually those which make the control easier. The undesirable instabilities are those which result in a machine which is not easily steerable, or which requires a constant nervous strain on the part of the pilot to prevent the machine getting out of control.	1912	1929.0118
"In each case the angle of ""pitch"" was 0°. The drag on the strut was measured by finding the difference between the weights required to balance the strut with the wind blowing on it in the various positions of ""yaw"" and the weight of the strut with the wind blowing from behind. The lift was measured by finding the difference between the weights required to balance the strut with the wind blowing on it and the weight of the strut with the wind blowing from behind. The angle of ""pitch "" was varied from 0° to 90° by intervals of 10°. In each case the angle of "" yaw "" was 0°. The results are given in the form of tables in Appendix I, the values of the coefficients of lift and drag being computed on the assumption that the frontal area of the strut is equal to the product of the width and the depth. 3. Theory. — The method of calculation is the same as that adopted in the previous tests. The co6fficients of lift and drag are given by the formulae 2m 2N 2D where C L is the coefficient of lift, C D the coefficient of drag, N the lift in pounds, D the drag in pounds, A the frontal area in square inches, and V the wind speed in f t./sec."	1912	1957.7397
In his factory at Parma he had various rooms illuminated with rays perpendicular to the plane of work, and rays forming an angle of 45° with the same. The two sets of rooms were otherwise alike with respect to the nature of the work done, and contained operators of the same age and physical condition. The perpendicular rays rooms had from 60 to 80 per cent. J50 of good work done, as compared with 40 per cent, in the rooms provided with oblique rays; and the percentage of absentees was considerably lower in the perpendicular rays rooms. A similar experiment was also tried in a Belgian factory, with the same results. Dr. Ciallenga insists on the importance of good illumination in increasing the output of a factory and lessening the number of accidents.	1912	1874.3619
In the case of a very intimate friend, in the case of a person with whom I can actually sympathise in all his feelings and thoughts, I need not resort to psychological analysis. That would indeed be an impertinence. In the second case I must take the other person as a stranger, as an individual of a race, of a nation, with whom I have no sympathy at all, with whose general characteristics I am acquainted. Instead of understanding him by the imitative entering into his inner life, I must take the psychological standpoint and try to discover the general laws which govern the life of that special kind of persons. In such cases, the case of the foreigner, the person of a different social class, the psychological understanding is indispensable.	1909	1874.13
At the line of discontinuity clouds will be noticed, especially cumulus and cumulostratus clouds, as well as increased humidity and occasional showers. These clouds are formed by the lifting and cooling of hot continental air due to the inflow of sea breeze air. [67] [68] [69] [70] It will be noticed from a study of the general features of a sea breeze why the wind change so often heralds the approach of a thunderstorm and of cooler weather. Such a change is a positive evidence of an advancing cool air mass and the inflow of cool air into the areas previously occupied by hot air is almost a positive indication of thunderstorms. AIR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY IN A SEA BREEZE. — The transition from warm to cool air occurs as a sea breeze moves inland. The wind shift and the onset or increase in the humidity occurs at almost the same time. These two changes therefore do not serve to differentiate between a sea and a land breeze. It is possible to measure the temperature and humidity during a sea or land breeze. The records shown in Figures 2 and 3 are taken from Abbe's Measurements at Siuslaw Bar. There occurred a very distinct sea breeze on the 22d of June 1889. The wind direction shifted from 16 degrees to 224 degrees at 3 p. m. The wind velocity increased from 5.5 miles per hour and decreased to 5.4 miles per hour. The temperature at 7 a. m. was 60.4°F. At 3 p. m. it was 55.9°F. The relative humidity at 7 a. m. was 84.2 percent.	1913	1950.0751
The following extracts from a lecture delivered before the men of the Electrical Engineering Department by Mr. J. D. Mclaren, Inspector of Factories, are published by the permission of the Lecturer. HOSE who are familiar with the working of the Electricity Supply Act, and who have read the various reports of the Chief Inspectors of Factories and Workshops, will no doubt have noticed that in many of the important factories and workshops where a large number of persons are employed, the use of electrical power is becoming more and more general, and that the drive of machinery by means of electric motors is increasing at a very rapid rate. Thus, in the cotton manufacture alone, the number of motors in use has increased from 25,000 in 1895 to 65,000 in 1907, and the horse power from 70,000 to 450,000.	1912	1903.9
"But he had a burning love for the Church of England, and a passionate desire for her revival. He became the teeth of the movement. He cast himself upon it, and flung himself into it — heart and soul, and mind, and strength, and energy. What he lacked in coolness of judgment he made good in fiery zeal. He had little of the mind of a theologian, but that only made him the more the minds of a prophet. As that wild and powerful poet, Coventry Patmore, has said of him — "" A poet of no common kind, He was a soldier and a seer; A poet of the heart and mind, A poet of the blood and the brain, Whose eyes were always open here, Who knew his country as the land Where Moses and the prophets trod, And heard, where England stood, the thunder of the Al God."""	1913	1870.3864
The statute does not undertake to define what it means by a promise to answer for the debt, default, or misdoing of another; but the courts have uniformly held that it means a promise to be secondarily liable, or to answer over, or to pay if the principal debtor does not pay, or to be liable only after the creditor has pursued his remedy against the principal debtor. 1' This is what is called a collateral or guaranty promise. If, however, the promise is one to pay primarily, or to be primarily liable, then it does not come within the statute, and a verbal promise will bind the promisor.‘ Thus, a promise to pay for goods which are to be delivered to another party, or to pay for work and labour which are to be done for another party, is a primary promise, and no writing is necessary to bind the promisor.	1913	1885.0795
"But in the north of Italy, especially in the valley of the Po, the collectivist spirit is strong. One sees it in the co-operative dairies, in the associations for the making of cheese, in the sugar beet societies, in the societies for the joint purchase of fuel, in the joint purchase of machinery, in the joint ownership of the irrigation canals. The whole region is dotted with the homes of these societies, where the manager lives, where the office is, where the big barn is, where the factory is. The co-operative cheese factory is usually to be found in the village, but even there it is sometimes in the centre of a courtyard, and it is always the largest building in the village. In the valley of the Po the collectivist spirit is alive, and it is a spirit of mutual aid, of mutual help, of mutual service, of mutual protection, of mutual defence against the big capitalist, the big dealer, the big buyer, the big seller, the big employer. The spirit of mutual aid is strong in the valley of the Po. It is a spirit of brotherhood, of fraternity, of solidarity. The Italians call it ""cooperazione, "" but it is not the mere utilitarianism which that word implies in America. It is not the mere ""getting together"" to buy a little cheaper, to sell a little dearer, to produce a little more."	1913	1909.7928
Whether she was the 'Derfflinger' I do not know, but I do know that the information I have given you is absolutely correct. That same Tuesday morning, but much earlier, the German Government had issued an official statement, from which it became clear that they were under the impression that they had been able to sink or disable almost all our armoured cruisers, and that they had nothing to fear from those vessels, the 'Exeter' among others, which had given them so much trouble in the Pacific. That same morning in the papers of neutral countries appeared a German statement, to the effect that three British armoured cruisers had been sunk by the 'Goeben' and 'Breslau.' That statement was absolutely untrue, but it showed the discomfort and worry that was beginning to penetrate even into German naval circles. The 'Goeben' and 'Breslau,' you will remember, arrived on the scene of action on the 4th of August. The 'Goeben,' her full power was said to be 30,000 horse power, weighed about 22,000 tons, and her guns were of a calibre of 28 cm., or about 11 inches. She was said to be able to maintain a speed of 26 knots under full steam. The 'Breslau' is a light cruiser which, when the war broke out, was stationed at Tsing-Tao.	1906	1906.2986

First off, it's hell for us to have to watch you being pulled out of a bog, or fished out of a river, or dragged into the stable by your bootheels, with the rest of your person still firmly attached to your horse.""

For example, the laboratories for embryology are provided with a large number of sinks with glass and porcelain surfaces, besides a water table for the use of the microtome, while the rooms for histology are fitted with the least possible number of sinks and surfaces that cannot be easily cleaned. A great deal of study by the various instructors goes into the plans for their laboratories and classrooms, and the effort is made to provide the necessary appliances and to avoid the unnecessary. The departments in this building are those of Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, Invertebrate Zoology, Comparative Vertebrate Zoology, Entomology, and Parasitology. The Anthropology department is located in the building which is also used by the departments of Mineralogy, Geology, and Paleontology. For the latter departments, as well as for Chemistry, Physics, and Psychology, excellent buildings have been erected, all connected by corridors. In the basement of the Zoological Laboratory is the museum of the department, which is being steadily increased. While the museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences is in many respects the best in the city, that of the University of Pennsylvania is particularly rich in preparations used in teaching, such as mounted insects, wax models of embryos, and other objects of study. Besides these, there are many interesting specimens, such as the mounted skeletons of the hippopotamus, manatee, owl, and rattlesnake, and the mummies of a hawk and a cat.	1911	1948.974
"Consequently, it is theoretically possible to soar to an infinite altitude without ever reaching a limit to the air. Actually, however, the atmosphere does become so thin that it cannot support life and jet propulsion, and sufficiently large increments of change are lacking to provide a normal flying condition. Above the so-called ""dead space"" (170-300 miles) there are traces of atomic particles. Mars, the most earth like of the planets, has an atmosphere which is thin enough to make an adequate shielding against cosmic rays impractical. On the assumption that cosmic rays inflict injury similar to that of strong x rays, a safety limit of 25,000 feet has been established for flying on Mars. Theoretically, the Martian atmosphere would support a type of dirigible comparable to those of Earth, but extra heavy shielding against cosmic rays would be needed. PARTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. — The atmosphere is composed of several distinct layers, or parts, differing in chemical composition and in electrical properties. These are: (1) Troposphere. The lowest layer, or troposphere, extends from the surface of the earth to an average height of 11 miles. There are 10 considerable variations in this altitude, being about 4 miles at the poles and 16 miles at the equator. Clouds are formed in this layer, and here occur all weather phenomena. The troposphere is about 75 percent of the total atmosphere. (2) Stratosphere. The stratosphere extends from the tropopause (the upper limit of the troposphere) to an altitude of about 50 miles. Temperature is constant and high, approximately 56° F."	1913	1984.1322
CHAPTER XIII. One day, in a small town in the Punjab, he was idling in the bazaar, when his eye was caught by a picture of the Madonna and Child. He had never seen a picture of the Madonna before, but he had heard of it — of the idea of the picture of the Queen of Heaven with the little Child in her arms.

"It is curious to read now the reviews of Huxley's lectures in the journals of the time. The names of Spencer, Tyndall, Huxley, Darwin, were then just beginning to be famous. As I have said, there had been no such impulse to thought as in Keats's time. The English people were growing rich. They were absorbed in money making. And Huxley appeared with the glad news that materialism is after all a rational, not a calamitous, view of existence. That there is no design in creation, that we are simply the product of mechanical development, was a proposition on which men had not been able to get into agreement. But science, it seemed, was now convinced ; and that a materialistic view of life is simply the truth, and that the implications of that truth are not at all dreadful, but on the contrary are pregnant with enormous moral possibilities, was the doctrine of Huxley. Here, for example, is a bit of the review of his lecture on ""Evolution and Ethics, "" which he delivered in 1874. "" The implications of the Evolution hypothesis are so momentous that we cannot wonder at the enthusiasm with which the exposition of it is welcomed by educated laymen. If man and all other organisms are the result of a process of evolution, then the old mechanical and materialistic view of nature, which made its advance as rapidly as the advance of exact science would permit, is justified."	1913	1928.887
The ground colour is grey, brown, or reddish brown, with a series of dark bands, which are often reduced to spots. The head is plainly marked with dark greyish brown. It is the most terrestrial of the genus, and is fond of lying out in the sun. It is also the most variable in colour. The third species is T. unicolor, which is uniformly greenish or brown above, and occurs in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It is more arboreal in its habits than either of the other two, and is fond of basking on the branches of low trees. Family Scincidae. Skinks. The Skinks are very easily recognised by the fact that they have little or no neck, the head being set directly on to the body. They are usually provided with smooth overlapping scales, and have the body more or less cylindrical, tapering towards the tail. The limbs, when present, are very small, and the tail is generally long and slender and does not break off easily. The mouth usually contains small teeth, and the tongue is not extensile. The ear openings are present. The majority of the skinks are terrestrial in their habits, and lead a very slug gish life, but there are many which are arboreal and even some which are aquatic in their habits.	1909	1880.9913
But the ultimate ideal is not the immediate ideal — and the immediate ideal is still undefined. The British control, which is the essence of the British occupation, has never been defined. It is a control exercised by British ministers in this country and in Egypt, and by the British resident in Cairo, who is assisted in his duties by a staff of British officials. The Egyptian ministers have been for some years chosen from among the most competent members of the Egyptian Parliament; and the control of the British resident is exercised, as a rule, through the British ministers of the Egyptian Cabinet. When Sir Edward Grey's attention was called to the case of an Egyptian minister who went to jail rather than submit to the orders of the British resident, he said that the minister's view was not the view which the British authorities take of their position.	1908	1895.9214
245 The story of the revival of the Persian Constitution is a thrilling one. For some years past, the Shah had been trying to contract foreign loans, but they depended on the construction of a railway from Teheran to Enzeli. The English Government was favourably inclined towards the scheme, but the Russians were opposed to it, and fomented discontent among the Persians. The question of the railway was the immediate cause of the second Persian revolution, which broke out in November, 1911. The first outbreak took place in 1906, and the Young Turks, some of whom were living in Persia, were the instigators. Later on, the Shah was forced to summon a Parliament, called the Medjliss. In 1908, however, the Shah, aided by the Russians, dissolved the Medjliss, and from that time the Constitution was practically a dead letter. The Young Persians endeavoured to revive it in vain. They had to fight against Russia and England, who were determined to uphold the absolutist regime of the Shah. Finally, in October, 1911, the Shah, relying on Russian support, again violently dissolved the Medjliss. This time, however, the revolt had to be against the Russians. The Young Persians, with the help of an Englishman, Captain Campbell, and some English officers, organised the revolt, and the Persian Constitution was revived after a battle of two days against the forces of the Shah and the Russians at Kasvin, the Russians finally joining the constitutionalists.	1907	1901.9855
She had a thin, pinched little face, and coarse, straight hair of a dirty yellow. She had the air of being a person who would never grow old. A little girl of seven or eight, with a pair of spectacles on her flat little nose, and a tight little braid down her back, she was not a person to make you think of the years. She had the air of being a person to whom nothing ever happened. She was Billy's wife, and I suppose that was something. But she had no life at all, outside of Billy. She lived in a little world of her own, which was made up of Billy and his interests. She had no other friends, no other amusements, no other thoughts. And she was happy. She was a little, thin, flat, grey figure of a woman, with no colour in her cheeks, no softness in her eyes, and no light in her hair, and she was happy. She was Billy's wife. And she was happy. For a long time, I could not make it out. I could not see why Billy Atheling's wife, of all wives, should be happy. I could not see what there was in Billy to make a person happy. For a long time, I could not see why Billy Atheling's wife, of all wives, should be happy.	1913	1925.1266
A discussion on the above subject was held on Wednesday, November 27th, and was introduced by Mr. F. H. W. P. Caster. The chair was taken by Mr. T. H. Caster, who opened the proceedings with a few remarks on the increasing importance of the question of lighting. Mr. F. H. W. P. Caster, in introducing the subject, said that the value of direct lighting depended entirely on the way the light was used, whether it was used in a more or less scattered manner or concentrated on a definite task. He considered that a direct light could be made to give good results, and he instanced the case of a drawing office where he had recently seen a very satisfactory arrangement of direct lighting, the lamps being set in the ceiling and arranged to throw the light downwards on the drawing boards.	1912	1876.2625

The extreme overruns found were 1'2, 1'1 and O'8 m.p.b. respectively, and the average of the three outstanding gusts was 1*0 m.p.b. These figures are very gratifying as showing the utility of the instrument. The fact that in so many cases the overrun was so much smaller than the artificial maximum is probably due to there not being a sudden dropping of the head after the application of the pressure. The work done has been very encouraging, but the author has not yet been able to complete a satisfactory calibration of the instrument. A few runs have been made in the reverse direction, and the author is glad to be able to report that the same overrun is obtained with the same gust, a fact which goes far towards proving the absolute independence of the instrument of pressure.	1912	1909.846
"Miss Rawson's peculiar talent for the portrayal of well bred, witty and charmingly human people is nowhere more delightfully displayed than in "" The Three Anarchists."" The story opens with the arrival in London of three young men, each of whom has recently inherited a large fortune. Each is determined not to be enslaved by wealth, and all three are agreed upon the plan of living in the most modest way, and making the best of the world as it is. They take a small house in a shabby street, and set about their various occupations. Their lives are soon complicated by the entrance of three very charming and unconventional young women, and the ensuing love stories are most entertaining. The book is full of wit and wisdom, and is sure to be very popular. The Sea Lady. H. G. WELLS Author of "" The New Machiavelli, "" "" The History of Mr. Polly, "" "" Love and Mr. Lewisham, "" "" Kipps, "" etc. A new romance by Mr. Wells is always an event of more than ordinary importance, for he is without doubt the most distinguished and original novelist of the day. In "" The Sea Lady "" he tells the story of the coming to land of a mermaid, who, in order to gain experience of human life, exchanges places with a young English girl."	1912	1895.584
So Claude felt. But on the evening of the tenth day after Mr. Forester's return, he was sitting outside the hall door, dreaming and wishing, as usual, under the soft October moonlight, when suddenly something cold and wet was thrust into his face, and, looking up, he found that Sophie was standing before him holding out a white envelope, which she had just taken from the side of her nose. The evening air had cooled her radiant front, and she had taken the precaution to rub it on the grass. 'What is it ?' asked her master, smiling for the first time that week. ' A letter for you, sir, from Mr. Winters, the vagabond. He put it under my orange leaves, ' replied Sophie, condescending to abandon her favourite game. Claude took the letter and opened it. It was written in pencil on half a sheet of note paper, and ran as follows : — ' Dear Sir, ' Mrs. Plimsoll has given a legacies (fifteen shillings) to the missions, and twenty-one shillings to the vagabonds. I am just off to Latrigg; come at once ! — Yours truly, ' James Winters. P.S. — The old lady's gone (poor thing !) ; but there's half a crown for you, too.	1908	1928.9098
— The discretion given to the engineer must be exercised in good faith, and in accordance with the purpose for which it was given. The discretion of the engineer, however, is not so restricted as that of the ofﬁcer who is without discretion and is liable for an erroneous judgment, and an honest mistake made by an engineer acting within the scope of his powers, is not ground of liability.3 1 Benton v.

These graphs are plotted on rectangular coordinates with temperature in degrees C. or F. as the ordinate and altitude as the abscissa. Since the main advantage of the pseudo adiabatic chart over the ordinary temperature altitude graph is that of the scale of pressure, some improvement in accuracy can be obtained in qualitative work by selecting a pressure base of 1000 mb or 850 mb and reducing values of temperature pressure and humidity from the radiosonde to this pressure. Such scaling is not necessary if the charts are used only for qualitative work. CHAPTER VIII PROBLEMS FOR THE STUDENT PROBLEM I. Using a pseudo adiabatic chart, construct the temperature humidity profile shown by the following data: 5.6 mb, 23.5C, 8.0 pph. 3.1 mb, 22.0 10.5 1.5 mb, 21.0 13.0 1.0 mb, 20.0 15.0 2.9 mb, 18.0 20.0 3.4 mb	1913	1962.388
Nay. Weep not! Kneel not! Hark! The Voice Of Christ rejecting sacrifice — Your manhood, and your Godhead, too — For prayers and tears, is calling you! Upon your feet! Your God is here — The Christ of Freedom on His Cross! Your tears are blood; and, lo! I hear The groans of slaves. Accounting loss And gain as God accounts, ye stand Presenting Him, not with the hand Of labour, but the idle palm Of prayer, that takes — not gives! To calm The tempest, teach the blind to see, And heal the leper, is my task; 143 And I must do it, not with thee, But through thee, if thou wilt not ask: To be my prayer — my living deed!

But I shall not anticipate. The day will come when I must say farewell to my work, when, like a father, I shall have to give my child away to another. Perhaps the moment will be one of pain, perhaps of joy. I do not know. I shall be calm, in any case. For I shall know that my work is ready, that it is finished, and that it is good. I shall know that it has been no mere illusion, that it has not been conceived and brought forth in the infinite Illusion, and that it will endure in the bosom of the Real. I shall know that it will be of service to men, that it will help them, that it is one of those works which serve to build a little the edifice of Truth.	1913	1880.4237
— The shafting of many machines is so constructed that the hd. ends of a shaft are free to move in a plane transverse to their axes. Such is the case, for instance, with a long line shaft supported on hangers, or with a locomotive driving axle, the motions of which are controlled in a transverse direction by the cranks. If, however, the motions of the shaft ends in this transverse direction are restrained by external forces, the problem of finding these restraining forces is one of mechanics of variable or changing systems, and hence is not included in the scope of this work. The natural transverse vibrations of a uniform rotating shaft of length /, radius of gyration /, and rotating harmonically with angular velocity œ are those of the unrotating shaft, the natural frequency being reduced by multiplying by the square root of 155 — the square of the angular velocity.	1908	1910.8158
They have been tried by every nation and by every race on the face of the globe. The Romans, with their advanced civilization, their high culture, and their superior knowledge of the laws of hygiene and sanitation, tried them, and failed. The Teutonic races have tried them, and they have failed. The Asiatics have tried them, and they have failed. In modern Europe we have tried them, and they have failed. The results of the persecution of women who have gone astray, and of the punishment of men who have visited such women, have always been the same. The women have been driven into the darker and more dangerous haunts, and the men have been deprived of the only protection which the social regulation of this traffic can afford.	1911	1888.0375
But it is only lately that we have become acquainted with the fact that a bath of alkaline polysulphide will sulphise and tone at one operation. It is supposed that the sulphide is more or less precipitated in the bath, and that it is this precipitate, whatever it is, that does the work. Now, this bath is very simple to prepare, and it tones very rapidly, so much so that one has to be careful, or else the prints become too dark. 1 have had some excellent results by sulphising and toning at one operation, the prints coming out fine sepia. I believe the bath is a little too strong at present, but that can easily be remedied. The following is the formula I have used: Take twenty-five grammes of liver of sulphur, dissolve in one litre of hot water; then add fifty grammes of carbonate of soda, and again dissolve completely. The bath is then ready. If prints are left too long, they become of a muddy black or brown. I have had no staining of paper as yet, and the prints are very much more permanent than those toned after fixing in the ordinary way. Yours truly, A. F. Tilley. Gentlemen: I enclose a print which has been sulphised and toned at one operation in the bath which Mr. Tilley describes in his letter to you.	1912	1889.318
"Not, then, against democracy, but against humanitarianism, is his warning. ""War,"" said he, ""is the parent of all great things""; and ""to me, "" he exclaims, ""the worst state is that which most skilfully organises and proclaims peace."" It is the spirit of peace he thus condemns, that spirit which ""wills the happiness of all men, "" and so in time generates the impotent rage for sharing happiness that very strong men feel when they have lost their greatness, and which makes the supreme art of living — the heroic acceptance of the inevitable — seem a crime. What is funereal about Nietzsche died with him. But the spirit which burns in his diatribes, the courage to revolt against the tyranny of indifference to greatness as a virtue, will live on. In the very heart of our comfortable humanitarisms, and, it may be, partly because of them, the quest of the ideal in the world of the unideal is going on ceaselessly. Individualism is rearing her head again, and the spiritual aristocracy basing itself on Dionysian instincts is being established by a few whom he called his disciples, by many unknown, in all the ranks of contemporaries. The coming generation, in revolt against materialism, will seize upon some of the more exalted aspects of this movement and reject its Mesquin side."	1913	1866.318
"Edward the Fourth! Even the Lord Mayor, Sir John Crosby, who had been one of Warwick's warmest supporters, went to the Tower, fetched the crown from there, and carried it on his own shoulders to Westminster Abbey. Edward was twenty-one years of age, and the youngest man ever to wear the crown of England. He was a fine soldier and a patron of men of action, big game, and athletic sports. The first act of his reign was to issue a proclamation which reads like a warning to his own discontented subjects, and a challenge to those who might oppose him. ""We, being moved with the tender and natural love that we bear to our subjects, and greatly lamenting the discord and mortal war raised and begun among them, to the utter destruction of our realm and the great impoverishing of our people, and to the high displeasure of Almighty God, and the peril of their souls that be therein, — ! to the intent to stay the said discord and mortal war, for the preservation of our people, and saving of their souls, have sent our gracious"	1912	1879.7451
"Claude spoke with the air of one who — if he did not actually go so far as to say it — felt that he was taking a far higher moral view than his companion. "" I don't think so. But we'd better change the subject. There's the train. Let's go and get our tickets."" "" Oh, there's time enough for that, "" Miss de Weel replied carelessly. "" And, anyway, I don't want any ticket."" "" Don't want any ticket ? "" Claude cried in astonishment. "" No; I want to go on the footboard."" "" Why, you silly little girl, you couldn't possibly go on the footboard. You know that as well as I. It's against the rules, and I should think you'd be the last person in the world to want to break the rules."" "" Oh, I don't want to go on the footboard in order to break the rules, "" she answered him, laughing. "" I want to go on the footboard in order to see the country properly, and feel that I'm really travelling. I've read of people going on the footboard, and I've always wanted to do it. But then, of course, I never thought of travelling with you."" She ended with a mischievous little laugh. ""And now you want to go on the footboard in order to tease me, "" Claude said, looking very much annoyed. "" I want to go on the footboard in order to satisfy a wish of a long time — as I told you."""	1908	1945.188
During the period mentioned, the average daily number of mothers in the Home was 9; the average duration of stay was 10.9 days; the longest was 206 days, the shortest 1 day. The weekly average cost of each mother was about 30d. The reasons for leaving the Home were as follows: Admitted to the Poor Law Infants' Home, 67; entered workhouse, 17; in which cases the home was made with great difficulty; certified to lunatic asylum, 6; returned home, 4; persuaded to enter the workhouse, 6; left without permission, 9; left voluntarily, 30; removed to another district, 1; transferred to another home, 1; one case died. The census of the 29 districts in London, compiled by the Women's League on December 31st, 1909, shows that there are at least 2,400 mothers in our capital city who are not in receipt of separate allowances, and who are known to be deserted or divorced by their husbands. 10,969 families are known to be living under these conditions in the whole of the United Kingdom. The direct influence of the Women's League on legislation has been slight, but it has been recent and its field is a very large one. It is impossible to sum up the results of its less direct action. The subject has been brought before the people, and local workers have been organised and have made many useful contacts. It is impossible to over estimate the value of this work. FOOTNOTES: 1.

The first step in preparing the land is to remove any old sod if the area is now in grass. This is usually done by ploughing in the fall and again in the spring, and then marking the land off for the rows. If the area is to be ploughed only once before the trees are set, it is better to do the ploughing in the spring when the soil is moist and mellow. If the area is now in corn or garden truck, the land should be kept as clean as possible so as to destroy weeds and to get the soil in good condition by the time the trees are to be set. (6) The method of marking the land off for the rows depends on the kind of fruit to be planted and the method of cultivation to be used.	1914	1945.784
"On the first Sunday in April I was awakened from a morning nap by the voicing of the mournful chant, and immediately took my place in the parade. Three perfect photographs resulted, and they are shown, reduced on Plate 39. To the right, the central figure is that of Rev. Mr. Merriman, whose picture, readers will remember, is used on the cover of this number. The other two figures are those of members of his congregation, on their way to the river. The two negro women to the right are each bearing a striped, straw-covered ""shouting"" basket, filled with ""shouting"" clothes in which the newly born ones are to be clad after immersion. The two men to the left are members of the congregation of Rev. Mr. Williams, whose ceremony is shown in the other two photographs on the plate. The woman in the white dress on Mr. Merriman's left is preparing to beat the tambourine, while the stout black lady to the left is posing with her ""shouting"" basket. The two pictures to the left represent the ceremony as it was conducted by Rev. Mr. Williams, an animated and little man, who is shown in the first photograph as he was preparing to dip the first of his converts in the water. Immediately he had dipped the woman, a member of the congregation, he called for another, and during the time he was baptising the second, the first was led back to the river's edge, where the well known ""shouting"" was performed."	1912	1888.5684
"If, therefore, an unoffending citizen is maltreated, or the property of a peaceful inhabitant is destroyed, it will be necessary for us to inflict punishment upon the district or the community in which such an occurrence has found place. We have no desire to punish the innocent for the guilty, but we are compelled to have this power in order to protect our soldiers, and we are forced to regard as i8 guilty those communities in which such occurrences take place, since it is impossible for us to ascertain the real authors of the offences. I have the honour to be, your Excellency, your most obedient servant, von Buelow. *» (4) The German Red Cross Society. — In this connection the following is of interest. On August 31, 1914, the German Red Cross Society published the following appeal in the Berlin daily press: — "" We appeal to you, who are still in Berlin, to assist us with the means which will enable us to carry on our work. You know that the German Red Cross Society takes no part in the collecting of funds for the support of the families of soldiers, and that our work is entirely separate. We devote ourselves alone to the care of the sick and wounded. At this moment we are particularly in need of linen, bed linen, and clothes, because we want to equip our military hospitals, which are being established in large numbers."	1906	1861.7755
The Red Bellied Black Snake is not to be feared, as it is very mild in disposition, and never aggressive. The Death Adder, or Acanthophis antarctica, is the most deadly of all. A bite will kill a man in from two to six hours, and the victim will die in horrible agony. It is a small snake, measuring from 3½ to 4½ ft. long. Its colour is variable, but it is usually a dark brown or grey, with cross bands of lighter colour. The head is broad and flat, and the tail terminates in a curious little process, which has been mistaken for a worm by birds and lizards, and so is often the means of luring them to their death. The Death Adder is not aggressive, and its method of attack is peculiar. It lies perfectly still, and appears to be asleep, with its head raised, and the tail waving from side to side. If the intruder does not come within striking distance it increases the movement of the tail, which is then taken to be a worm, and so it is lured on to within distance of the head, which then strikes with lightning rapidity. The bite is not followed by any immediate symptoms of injury, and the victim has time to get help. The snake is common in the eastern half of the continent, and is often seen in the suburbs of Melbourne.	1909	1877.0399

The infantry fought like lions, but the German soldiers were reckless, and the slaughter was terrible. Of the defenders, a few only were armed with modern weapons, but the majority had the old Martini Henry rifles, and the fire was deadly. It was a repetition of the defence of the Plevna redoubts. The Russians fought like devils, and the streets were a sea of mud and blood. The Germans were unable to advance, and the slaughter was terrible.

Greek music, architecture, sculpture, philosophy, and science were thus developed. The situation, of course, was favourable, but it was the form of society — militarj^ and not theocratic — that made this possible. In Ireland, the same condition prevailed. The physical features made great empires impossible. The contests between the number of small states separated by mountains and bogs kept the best intellect free for intellectual pursuits. Abstract thought was not absorbed in the discussion of material questions, for all material interests centred in the local chieftains, and the struggles to keep their tribal power. Liberty existed, for kingship was elective. Theocracy was absent. The impulses were strong for intellectual development, and this was possible. The community was well organised for its purpose, and it fulfilled that purpose well. The culture — music, architecture, sculpture and so on — was developed beyond expectation.	1908	1871.6422
light in a studio so conveniently placed as to be equidistant from the camera and the subject, and even rarer is an arrangement of lights which will be at the same distance from all parts of the subject. Therefore, to rely on candlepower to give an idea of the light-producing advantages of various illuminants is utterly misleading. What the photographer needs to know is the comparative efficiency of different light producing bodies, and this can be best learned by comparing their luminance. This is the subject factor to which reference has been made. It is defined as the relative brightness of a surface, at an equal distance, under equal illuminations from different sources of light. To illustrate, let us consider that the standard candle, the incandescent electric light, and the magnesium ribbon are all placed at a distance of four feet from the same surface. The quantity of light emitted by each is found to be as follows: • Candle. Incandescent Light. Magnesium Ribbon. 1 16 90 Then, the subject factor for the incandescent light is sixteen, and for the magnesium ribbon, ninety, the subject factor for the candle being obviously unity. These subject factors enable the photographer to directly compare the efficiency of different light producing bodies in illuminating a given surface. They also furnish the means for determining the time of exposure necessary under different conditions, and under different methods of exposure.	1912	1925.4644
This is placed in a cylinder covered by a quartz plate and blackened on the inside, and the response obtained is compared with that given by a standard source of light. The sources examined were carbon and metallic filament lamps, ordinary and special arclamps, gasflame and vapour lamps. The result of the examination is shown in the accompanying table, which values are seen to agree well with those determined by previous observers. Editor.] * Trans.

""" I think it was the steering gear, "" said Garth, following him; and I was just on the point of doing so when I became aware of a most peculiar whistling sound, which was rapidly increasing in volume, and which seemed to come from the side of the Areonal nearest the stern. I accordingly ran to the door of the air chamber and opened it, and was at once blown into the apartment by a violent blast of air, which, as I subsequently learned, had been rushing in through the gash in the hull created by the breaking of the propeller and steering gear, and was now escaping through the door, which M'Allister had failed to close. I found the two boys standing close together, gazing in the direction of the stern, and as the door swung open I caught a glimpse of the cause of the disaster. The propeller and rudder had been broken off, leaving a large gap in the stern of the vessel, which was already beginning to fill with water, and through which the air was rushing in a torrent. The Areonal was now lying at an angle of about 45°, and was fast settling down by the stern. I had just time to close the door before the water came pouring in through the gap, and was driven back into the main compartment, which was already half full of water, by the force of the current. "" We must get out the lifeboat, "" shouted M'Allister, "" and be quick about it, too, or we shall all be drowned."	1911	1877.3121

Our artillery has made short work of the enemy's redoubts in the belt of woodland, and our infantry has easily driven the English out of it. It was a difficult task, for the woods are dense, and the bridle and footpaths narrow. The English had barricaded these, and by using machine guns and rifles with great determination, had made our progress slow and costly. Once we got into the woods, however, our superiority in numbers told. We overwhelmed the enemy, and drove them out of the woods and back to the line of the railway, which they now hold. We have also set Epping on fire, and it is now burning in several places. I hear that the English are now in very great straits, their food supplies have been cut off, and their troops are in a very exhausted condition.	1906	1888.4149
Judge Carpenter holds that, while the act itself does not create a crime, violation of its provisions is made criminal by other statutes. April 19 — Judge Carpenter denies a motion to quash the indictments on the ground that the grand jury was not properly impanelled, and also denies a motion to strike out certain surplusage in one of the indictments. April 28 — Judge Carpenter overrules the packers' plea that they cannot be prosecuted for acts committed prior to July 1, 1909, and also their plea that the indictments are void because they charge the crime was committed in Chicago, whereas the anti trust statute covers the whole United States. May 1 — Judge Carpenter overrules a plea of the packers that the indictments charge an impossible crime. July 28 — Judge Carpenter overrules motions of the packers to dismiss the indictments, to quash the venire, and to discharge the marshal as a juror. The packers then ask for an immediate appeal to the circuit court of appeals. Judge Carpenter refuses to delay the trial for this purpose. Aug. 28 — The packers again appeal to the circuit court of appeals. This time they ask for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Carpenter from proceeding further in the case.

"In spite of all this he is lonely. One day he accidentally sees a girl who is gathering roses in her father's garden, and then the second half of the poem is taken up with his pursuit of her, for this, after all, is the indispensable adventure of every Oriental tale. ""At the sight of her he became as pale as death and trembled violently. All the faculties of his soul were absorbed in a passion which had no name in his language, and to which he had till that moment been a stranger."" So violent is his infatuation that he forgets to make her a courtesy before driving away in his golden chariot, and the rose she has dropped becomes ""a source of inexplicable pleasure and unhappiness."""	1913	1895.5564
"In December, 1910, an order was issued by the Department, signed by Postmaster General Hitchcock, limiting the weight of second class (periodical) mail matter to four pounds, effective February ist, following. It will be recalled that the American Magazine, at great expense, conducted an investigation of the effect of this order. As a result, the matter was postponed, and, on April ioth, following, an order was issued, signed by Postmaster General Hitchcock, limiting the weight of second class (periodical) mail matter to as follows: 1. 8 ounces, effective February 15, 1912. 2. 4 pounds, effective August 15, 1912. The injustice of this order will be apparent to any thoughtful person. It penalizes The Country Gentleman, and The National Geographic Magazine, published monthly, has issued a pamphlet appealing to the American people for assistance. The Southern Railway has issued a pamphlet showing the results of the loss of their patronage. The American Magazine, in its appeal to the American people, quotes the following from The Independent: ""One is forced to the conclusion that this attack upon the magazines arises from hostility to the honest opinion of the magazines respecting public affairs."" The campaign of the Post Office Department against the magazines is merely a part of the campaign of the reactionaries against all reform, and because the magazines are the organs of reform, they are especially obnoxious to the reactionaries."	1911	1921.3026
There are, therefore, certain rules established whereby the terms may be ascertained in a more rational way. 99. Necessary to Reduce to Writing. — Some contracts are required by law to be in writing. And, therefore, as to these the question of proof of terms does not arise. Were oral proof admitted the very evil which the law aims to correct would ensue; namely, the frauds and perjuries which would be practised. The law does not assume that men are dishonest or that they cannot be believed under oath; but it is deemed best by the law to make use of the honest and reliable memory of a third person who will perpetuate the transaction in such form that there will be no dispute as to what was agreed to and no failure of proof by the death, failure to remember or disappear ance of the principal actors in the transaction.	1913	1888.5471
"e., with the intention of being bound immediately if his offer is accepted, his offer is accepted by the other party, and that party by his acceptance evidences a similar intention to be bound."" Of course, the acceptance to be effectual must be of every essential element in the offer. There must be a mutual assent to the same thing, and, as it is usually stated, ""an acceptance to be binding must be absolute and unqualiﬁed, uniform and ﬂat, leaving no room for any qualilication, alteration or contradiction.""“ 93. Unilateral Contracts and Bilateral Contracts. — It is perhaps at this point that we should notice the distinction between what are termed unilateral and bilateral contracts. A bilateral contract is one in which the obligation or duty on the part of both parties constitutes the consideration each has for the promise of the other; 1. e., in which there is a mutual exchange of promises. A unilateral contract is one where only one of the parties to the contract is bound."" It is sometimes said that with the making and acceptance of a unilateral contract the mind of the promissor is not stayed; that is to say, the one party is not bound to make a promise or perform an act. A contract of sale, by example, is a bilateral contract, while a reward offered for the return of lost property is a unilateral contract, as the one party makes but one promise, while the other, in order to make the contract bilateral, must comply with the condition and claim the reward."" 94. Method of Forming Contracts. — We have already said that an agreement may be formed by words, either spoken or written, or by conduct."	1913	1869.3148
Germany has about 90,000 miles more than England in the matter of length of wire, the totals being 352,477 miles for Germany and 262,677 miles for England. These totals are natural enough when one remembers that all of the European countries, except England, have a state monopoly of the telegraph business. In England the telegraph lines are owned by private corporations. Many statistics of interest in this connection are given in the work published by the international bureau. Thus, for example, it is shown that on the continent of Europe about ^ne half of the wire employed is of copper. 1 he countries which employ the least copper wire are Norway and Sweden, with about one eighth of copper wire in their lines, Austria, one eighth, and Russia, one ninth.	1907	1929.0089
"The true experimental method, as we see, cannot be applied to ""infantile paralysis."" In the first place, the disease cannot be reproduced in animals. In the second place, the material from a case of the disease, that is to say, the ""virus, "" is not constant, but variable. It has been found in the secretions of the respiratory tract and in the urine, and it has been passed through the alimentary canal of monkeys without losing its infectivity, so that it is probably not in the faeces that we shall find it. The virus has been shown to be filterable, and to be destroyed by heat (80 degrees C. for five minutes), but not by boiling. It is not inactivated by exposure to sunlight, nor by the use of strong disinfectants. The virus has been found to retain its activity for a year at least, when dried, and for months when kept in a moist condition. It is probable that the ""virus"" is not a bacillus or microbe, but some kind of a filterable virus, a minute parasite, perhaps a protozoon, perhaps something even more minute and more subtle. The name ""virus"" is commonly used to denote anything of that kind, whether it be a microbe or not. What is meant by a ""filterable virus"" will be understood by a reference to the accompanying cuts. (Figs. 18 and 19.) The first is a diagrammatic representation of a filter, such as is used for the separation of the filterable virus of yellow fever or of rabies."	1911	1936.057
Make no enlargement of the prints, as it is too much trouble. A good quality of printing paper will give a print that is quite acceptable to the average person. The only enlargements that I make are to please myself. The first thing to consider is the arrangement of the group. It is best to have the camera so placed that the centre of the group will be about two-thirds of the distance from the bottom of the picture to the top. In other words, the centre of the group should be on the vertical line that divides the picture into thirds. If the camera is at a distance of ten feet from the group, it is a simple matter to measure off seven feet from the bottom of the camera on the vertical line and place two or three persons there, the others being arranged around them.	1912	1946.0951
The ornamental posts were finished in pale green, and the lamps contain mineralized carbons burning a light azure blue. The posts were painted a light green, and the electric wires were grouped or concealed wherever possible. The centre of Copley Square is occupied by the well known statue of the late President McKinley. This was surrounded by a circular hedge, and the shrubbery was illuminated by incandescent lamps burning a pale rose pink, fixed at various altitudes in the foliage and concealed as much as possible. On the south side of Copley Square is the Boston Public Library, whose front and terrace were decorated with incandescent lamps burning light orange. The terrace was treated with 16 lamps, arranged in pairs between each pair of the balustrade posts, 8 ft. apart. The front of the building was treated with 14 lamps arranged in pairs between the windows of the second floor balustrade, 10 ft. apart. The lamps were fixed, as much as possible, in the shadow of the posts and balustrade. The effect was to give the appearance of a glowing outline to the terrace and the front of the building. The lamps were finished in dull grey. The Boston Art Museum, which occupies the next position on the west front of the square, was treated in a like manner, but with incandescent lamps burning a light azure blue.	1912	1897.3951
Geoffrey's heart swelled with pride, and yet a little with resentment, when he saw the sketch, pinned on a board, surrounded by a collection of the rarest things in the room. He rose in the night and went to it, and touched it, and saw that none of the pins had rusted. But all this glory left Alma quite untouched. She gazed at the sketch indifferent, and Geoffrey found her in a very deep slumber, one afternoon when he had coaxed her to his apartment. He had carried her to the great armchair and covered her with his coat; and, standing before her, he had looked down into her face, with its pale, blue, half-defiant eyes, half-closed in sleep. He had seen the lips that had spoken so many childish things, that had laughed so much, that had cried so little, pressed together in a straight, grim line. There was no bloom of innocence or of unthinking youth on that face. It was the face of a woman who had suffered — and who had not forgotten. Geoffrey remembered that experience of the afternoon as he stood on the pier. He had heard all the old, familiar, half- contemptuous comments about him as he had walked beside the statue of the poet — one of the many statues of the poet — that stands in Washington Square, and that had been draped for the summer with a great green parasol of the trees.	1913	1890.8583
The discovery of a comet by a meteor train would be a remarkable event. The first comet to be discovered by a telescope, that of 1811, was seen by the aid of a meteor train. It is a common experience that a meteor is seen to burst into two or more pieces, and that these fragments move for a time in parallel paths, but almost always at different speeds. Sometimes the separation is so sudden that the fragment or fragments are seen to move away from the principal body, and the paths of the two parts of the system are then at once divergent. Sometimes, on the other hand, the separation is by no means so abrupt, and the paths of the two parts are for a considerable time parallel and very nearly coincident.	1911	1912.747
"Dalzell said to the House: ""Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Cleveland has made a very extraordinary speech. He has said his steel works are running at a loss; that he is almost on the verge of bankruptcy, and yet, as a final appeal to our sympathy, he has moved to put steel rails on the free list. I ask the House to consider whether that is the language of a sane man."" And Tom Johnson, rising in his seat, answered: ""Yes; but it is the language of a free man."" There he stood, typical of the American citizen who is not afraid to speak his convictions; who is willing to take the chance of having a majority vote against him; who is not afraid of being licked; who will not sell himself for a mess of pottage; who will not be put down or barred out; who will not be stampeded; who has conscience in his vote; who is a hero, a Theodore Roosevelt, a Tom Johnson, and who, when the time comes for him to die, can look forward with the joy of Edward A"	1911	1927.7892

He has never been a rich man, and there have been years in his life when he received less actual money for all his professional services than many a prosperous Boston merchant receives in a week. He has not only been ready to give his time, experience and knowledge gratuitously to all who needed it and could not pay for it, but frequently he has not only treated the sick free of charge himself but has furnished the means and medicine necessary for the cure of his patients. He has been in the habit of donating regularly to the free dispensaries, and no institution of a charitable nature in which he could render a service, has been ever turned from his door, even to the giving of money to assist in the relief of some suffering family.	1911	1887.25
"It was not, however, until the Germans had suffered heavily that the defenders were forced to retire, and then only after a last stand in the churchyard of St. Leonard's. Many of the brave band escaped by a network of underground passages, and are now carrying on the fight in the East End of London. The Germans claim to have lost over four hundred men in this desperate affair."" After this the fighting in London became more and more desultory for a time, but the German forces, even with reinforcements, were not numerous enough to occupy the vast city, and it was soon made apparent by the British that they were not going to submit to any prolonged occupation. On the night of the 29th a great fire broke out in the South of the Metropolis, apparently in the neighbourhood of the Crystal Palace. Many German aeroplanes were seen hovering over London that night, and it is believed that the conflagration was due to the dropping of incendiary bombs from them. Barricades were hastily thrown up in various places, and about the same time came news of a great uprising of the citizens of Birmingham, Nottingham, and other towns of the Midlands. On the 30th the Germans endeavoured to advance from King's Cross towards Finsbury Park, but were met by a determined resistance from a band of Territorials and citizens, and driven back. The Central London Railway was, however, working, and the Germans, taking possession of the underground station at Moorgate Street, succeeded that night in bringing up a large quantity of guns and ammunition."	1906	1900.8055

For there, John Howard, the philanthropist, was taught to read and write, and from that humble beginning he grew to be one of the greatest of Englishmen. But there is no need to dwell on Chelsea's literary associations. They are as familiar as they are numerous, from the poet Cowley to the poets of to-day. Moore, Shelley, Tennyson, Carlyle, Froude, Thackeray, Swinburne, Burne-Jones, Rossetti, and a host of minor writers and artists, are all bound up in its memories. But the interest of these associations is not merely local. They form a part of the great literary history of the world, and are as significant as they are varied. Moore's house, for example, is a landmark in the history of the Irish national movement, and Thackeray's in that of English social reform. The Chelsea of to-day is a Chelsea of contrasts. It is at once the residence of the rich, the poor, and the struggling. It is a place of retreat for the invalid, the artist, and the man of letters. It is a centre for antiquarians, and a favourite haunt for the pleasure seeker. In its parks and gardens, its river walks and shady nooks, its art galleries and museums, its old churches and historic houses, it offers a thousand resources to the busy man and the idle. 1 It is the Chelsea of to-day, but it is also the Chelsea of yesterday. It is alive with the spirit of the past, and yet it is not a place of mere antiquarian interest.	1908	1908.514
Another method of giving a matt surface to a print is to dip it in a solution of gelatine and water, 1 part of gelatine to 10 or 20 of water, and while the gelatine is still wet to dust on some fine talc powder, and so give a surface of talc. The powder is then dusted off, and the print is dried. The talc may be coloured by using coloured powders. The surface may be varnished by using a solution of 1 part of shellac in 3 or 4 of alcohol. If this is used, the print must be mounted before the varnish is applied. If the varnished print is to be unmounted, the varnish should be applied only to the back of the print, not to the front, as by varnishing the front the surface of the print is altered, and it cannot then be satisfactorily toned. If the print is to be mounted the varnish should be applied to the back, as that will hold the print more firmly to the mount. The varnish should be applied with a brush, and care should be taken that it is not applied too thickly, as it is liable to run. If it does run, it can be cleared away with a rag dipped in alcohol.	1912	1924.4594
The void was due to the fact that no cloister had opened its doors and received her within its sanctuary. But of that Amelia was wholly ignorant. And so, partly at the instigation of her mother and partly because she herself believed it, she went off to service with a family of the name of Blenkinson — a well-to-do family — and the mistress of this family was a Mrs. Blenkinson — a woman of the world who took a good deal of pleasure in her position. Now, the only thing that the qualities and accomplishments Amelia had fitted her for, were the making and washing of bed linen, the cleaning and the cooking. But she was obedient, and did these things well. Mrs. Blenkinson, being a woman of the world, had a less exalted idea of her own and her family’s dignity than many a woman of no world at all has. She had no idea whatever that it was degrading to her to make her own bed and wash her own napkins. If you are a lady, your social position must be above your servant’s, and it is gratifying to know that in this country the class of people who have the best claim to call themselves ladies is the most numerous class of all. But, on the other hand, Mrs. Blenkinson never let Amelia, or any of the other young women who served her in the capacity of lady’s maids and house maids, forget for a moment that they were her servants.	1908	1929.9989
The author looks on the bright side of human nature and human affairs, and the hopefulness and optimism that characterise his book will appeal to many readers. An unusual number of the characters are admirably drawn, and the book is full of good things. One might read it for the sake of the delightful conversations that are recorded in it, even if he were not interested in the thoughtful and important questions to which the conversations are a means of introducing. The book is sure to awaken attention, and should be read, not only by Unitarians, but by all thoughtful Christians. As a means of understanding the forces that are at work to make the world a better place to live in, it is well worth reading. A HISTORY OF THE NEW ENGLISH CHURCH MOVEMENT. By Simon C. Gilbert. 12mo, pp. 239. Price $1.25 net. Boston : George H. Ellis Company. Mr. Gilbert presents in this volume a lucid account of the origin and growth of the New English Church Movement from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present time. He also gives an account of the present condition of the movement and of its leading representatives. The book is intended primarily for the clergy and laity of the American Episcopal Church, to whom it appeals for sympathy and support in behalf of the great movement which it describes.	1911	1900.0721
"The force on the rudder is, by the third principle of dynamics, numerically equal and of sign opposed to the force required to deflect the dirigible in the horizontal plane, when the dirigible is abandoning the control. If FO is the force (weight, buoyancy, and horizontal resistance) required to deflect the dirigible, then Ff = FO where f = 9 by (11), and f, is the resultant of all the forces on the rudder. The angle 3, called the angle of control, is that between the resultant f, and the plane of the rudder. Hence Sine / = 1^ Cosine (3 = IfOJ f where 19 is the angle between the line of action of the total force 9 and the plane of the rudder. For example, if 9 is zero, 9 and 3 are parallel and 19 is 0, then the angle of control is 90° and the force on the rudder is at maximum possible value. Hence the angle of control is given in a very simple manner by the relation 1 A A A Sine 2 $ Cosine 19 3 = / Cosine 3 where A is the area of the rudder, ""is the aspect of the rudder, and Is a constant depending on the nature of the surface of the rudder. 19 The positive and negative signs in the value of fa correspond to the two possible senses of rotation of the dirigible."	1912	1919.6597
"And yet, whatever may have been his annoyance-.he must have experienced also his moments of satisfaction, for during his lifetime his efforts contributed more than those of any other individual to the revival of the poetic and dramatic genius of his country. As an actor, he shone in many of Shakespeare's plays, and his performances made them better appreciated; as a manager he brought forward anew several of the old works, others he modernised, rewriting or interpolating as he thought best, while in 1769, through his energy, the Shakespeare Jubilee was celebrated at Stratford-on-Avon — an event which did not pass unnoticed by the poet's contemporaries, but which is now only remembered in connection with Garrick's well known lines in honour of the bard : — "" What needs my Shakespeare for his honour'd bones, The labor of an age in piled stones ? 1 Desnoire, ibid., p. 75."	1912	1894.6567
"723) describes a case in which Wright's method of inoculation against cholera was tried and was followed by violent symptoms which had to be treated by large doses of opium. The great German authority, Koch, issuing a general warning against the inoculation of animals and humans for the prevention of disease, says : ""Those who suffer from the inoculation of living microbes remain permanently invalided with a variety of chronic diseases."" The most interesting and important subject of how to get on without food was hardly touched upon in the first volume of this work. No doubt, however, partly owing to the fact that it has been dealt with in other books, and partly to the publication of the report of the experiment with Mr. Horace Fletcher (Chapter XIV.) and the letters on the subject, the question is becoming less of an enigma to the average reader."	1911	1947.5399
They were used to a military force composed of their own fellow citizens, and they were not ready to accept as a part of the King s army any portion of the strangers who had come over with him. The result of the rebellion was that the Conqueror's sheriff was killed, and a garrison of the King's men was slain to the last man. The march from London is described in the chronicles as slow and almost funereal, the King being unable to hasten it, because he had to bring with him from the capital the whole treasure in his coffers, which was enormous. The march was of course through winter weather. The result was the complete subjugation of a city which had not been subjugated at the time of the Conquest, and which had enjoyed for three generations the privileges of a city of the Empire.	1912	1882.3024
"Hence there are only two axes of rotation, the fixed one (Z) about the vertical through the CG., and the axis (Y) about the lateral axis through the CG. The moments about the fixed vertical axis are called the ""yaw moment"" and the moments about the lateral axis are called the ""pitch moment."" The forces and moments are defined in the usual way. The zero angle of yaw is defined as that angle at which the line fixed in the body is parallel to the relative wind. The angles of yaw are positive when the relative wind is to starboard of the line fixed in the body. The curves (Figs. 13-16) are drawn in accordance with these definitions. It will be seen that the curves of the yaw moment are very similar for the two positions of the rudder, and that the effect of the rudder is to decrease the yaw moment in the direction of the rudder. The curves of the pitch moment on the other hand are very different for the two positions of the rudder. In the case with the rudder at 20° the pitch moment is positive at all angles of yaw, while with the rudder at 0° the pitch moment is negative at large angles of yaw. The reason for this difference is not clear. The nature of the forces and moments is more easily understood when the planes of symmetry of the bodies are taken as the planes of reference."	1912	1953.6699
"He was again warned by the War Office to be very careful, and to make no statements which, if it were discovered that they were exaggerated or untrue, might be used against the Government. He was told that the military authorities quite recognised his patriotism in endeavouring to secure the safety of his country, and that his information would be most carefully sifted before being given to the Press. Bourne, of the Daily Banner, who was present at this interview, gave the following report of it : — "" You must remember, Colonel Macdonald, "" said the official, "" that a great deal of what you state is somewhat vague, and some of it borders on the incredible. You say that the Germans have landed at Weybourne Hoop, and you give the figures; but why, in the name of all that is reasonable, did you not go to the nearest military authorities instead of starting off on that mad cross country ride which you made, and which, according to our reports, was a very near thing ? "" "" Because, "" said Colonel Macdonald, "" I knew I should not be believed. I should have been told that the Germans had no ships, that they could never have crossed the North Sea, and other equally stupid arguments. I knew that if I had the good fortune to get through their lines I should be believed and have time to warn the country."	1906	1872.3071
At 4.32, after a fierce engagement in which the destroyers had lost two of their number, and the Kincardineshire had been set on fire and was sinking, the Deutschland was seen to be alone to the south east with the Lion and the two cruisers. The position was as follows : — The Lion and the two cruisers were engaging the Deutschland in the centre of the gap ; the Kincardineshire was on fire, and sinking with her head to the north ; two destroyers were steaming slowly in the direction of the Kincardineshire, and the other eight were heading towards the Deutschland, who had been driven to the south east by the Lion and the two cruisers. The whole of the German liners had been sighted and chased by the destroyers, but the Kronprinz Wilhelm and the Kaiser Wilhelm II. had escaped. The Deutschland had been forced to surrender, and the Lion and the two cruisers were in pursuit of the other two German liners. The loss to the British was two destroyers and the Kincardineshire, but the Kincardineshire had been practically destroyed. The loss to the Germans must have been enormous. The action lasted from 3.55 to 4.32, a period of thirty-seven minutes. The distance over which it extended was about fifteen miles. The time taken by the Deutschland to cover the seven miles from the Lion to the Kincardineshire was four minutes.	1906	1898.12
“I was present at the hearing, ” said the bishop, “and I had the satisfaction of hearing you described by your legal counsel as a ‘young man of most exemplary character and piety.’ Of course, under the circumstances, the opinion of the court was that the right of presentation was vested in you. I have taken a house in the village, ” he continued, “and I hope that you will not let any legal scruples interfere with the acceptance of your father’s living. And I trust that you will do your duty by the people. There are some, I fear, who have scarcely realised the change which has taken place in their condition, and who still think of themselves as under the pastoral care of my dear predecessor.	1908	1893.5675
The following extract from a letter written by a member of a surveying party to his mother, gives a particularly vivid idea of the difficulties which the mice caused. He wrote: 'Well, dear, I am glad you got that parcel, but I am sorry that you had to open the canteen. I had put in the bottom a lot of fancy biscuits which I thought you would like, and above them some others. But the mice have been so bad with us, that I had to put some strychnine in a canteen to poison them, and I guess the strychnine got to the bottom of the canteen. I left it there for a few days, and then took it out and poured some water in, and the same water ran through the biscuits. I am sorry you had the bottom ones, but it could not be helped. Well, about the mice. They got into my pack bag the other night and gnawed a hole in the top of my water bag, and got down and chewed right through my best revolver case. I woke up about midnight feeling something pulling at my nose. I shoved my hand up under the mosquito netting, and caught one by the tail. I pulled it down and tried to smash it under my pillow, but it slipped out of my hand.	1909	1894.9749
When I pointed out that they did exist, the Foreign Secretary was unable to deny the fact, but stated that we could not judge of their value unless we had read them. He knew better, for he was a man of learning and experience, but he was not prepared to admit that the evidence was conclusive. The truth is that the English officials are not really aware of the progress which has been made in Egypt during the last twenty years. The general impression is that the Khedive Abbas II. put a stop to the reforms initiated by the late Khedive, and that since the British occupation the educational movement has been entirely in the direction of English instruction, and that Arabic instruction is confined to the Koran schools.	1908	1910.3679
As was pointed out in the Report of the Committee on Railway Lighting, the lighting of goods sheds is a matter of great importance, and one which does not receive the amount of attention it deserves. The lighting of a goods shed is not a matter of providing a certain number of lamps, but of well distributing those lamps, and I am glad to say that the majority of the sheds I visited showed that this was being realised. It is, however, a matter for regret that there are still some railways which do not seem to appreciate the importance of well distributed light in their goods sheds. It is a mistaken economy to provide insufficient lighting in these sheds, as it is sure to lead to damage to goods and to accidents to shunters and others. Time is wasted by shunting operations being carried out in a slow and uncertain manner owing to the inability of the workers to see clearly, and this is a matter which ought to appeal to railway managers.	1912	1886.2102
"Conversely, low winter sun, together with low land and water surface temperatures, creates poor sources of convection currents; and inversions are left undisturbed. Such Winter inversions in the northern temperate zone are pronounced in cities because of locally contaminated air. Therefore, inversions in cities are higher in Summer than in Winter. 810 59. 59  AIRCRAFT OPERATION. — The flight of seacraft through the atmosphere does not depend on atmospheric dirt; but aircraft may be forced to descend below an inversion because of a decrease in power or to increase their speed below it. Thereby they enter a dirty layer, and are impaired in performance by dirt which increases drag, dirt which clogs radiators and dirt which impairs vision. Depending on the extension of the inversion, a pilot may not be able to land or dock his craft. Moreover, the operation of his craft is impaired physically by dirt-filled air and by dirt-caused failure. DATA ON AIRCRAFT OPERATION. — Data on the effect of air impurity on the operation of ships lighter than air is not readily available. However, data from the Tomlinson Experiments on the effect of particle laden air on the operation of heavier than air craft, is summarised in the following paragraphs.

It is in this twang that he bids you Flee, and adds, ' pray come soon y', for I shall never be well till I see you.' I have made Dapar write me this letter; for I am so weak (and have been so since my last to you) that I cannot hold a pen, and am in much pain: but I shall not lose any opportunity of writing to you, and I hope to be able to come and see you in a few months. God bless you, my dear child. Your affectionate father, J. Johnson. [To Mrs. Johnson, at Lichfield.]  SIR, [London, Jany. i, 1740-41.] I am at last, by the blessing of God, got safe to town, where I was on Tuesday last, after a journey which, for slowness of motion and severity of weather, was, perhaps, never equalled. I was on the road four days, and had a night for refreshment at Stourbridge, where I had no sooner got into bed than the inn was surrounded by robbers, who broke open the coach of Mr. Giffard, manager of the theatre at Birmingham, and took from him, as I am informed, about a hundred pounds.	1912	1865.4977
The result was that, when one came into the station from outside, the roof appeared black, and the whole effect was that of a cave, which was very depressing. He was not at all sure that it was not better to have a larger expenditure on a roof illumination than on that of the floor. Mr. Harrison had spoken of the lighting of the booking and waiting rooms. He was glad to hear it, for he had always maintained that the lighting of these places was most important, as they were the rooms in which the public spent the greatest time, and during which they were most susceptible to the influence of good or bad lighting. He had always thought that the illumination of a railway station was a very difficult problem, and that it was a problem which could only be solved by very intimate co-operation between the electrical engineer and the architect.	1912	1887.0729
"The doctor listened to me with the closest attention, and the expression of his face was to me decidedly annoying. He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his hands together, as if to dry them. His eyes shone with a peculiar light, and his face had a curious expression, which I can only compare to that of a cat which is watching a mouse. I glanced at Mr. Googery, and saw that he was eyeing me with a look of the most intense curiosity. My cousin, who had been observing the effect which my account had produced upon the two men, at this juncture said, "" I think it would be better for you to tell your story in full, David, for these gentlemen seem to be deeply interested in your adventures."" "" Yes, "" said Mr."	1911	1875.0006
"It is said that Professor Very is not yet satisfied with his conclusions, and will continue his Mars observations this season, employing the great Lick telescope. The astronomers at the Lick Observatory at Mount Hamilton, California, have been equipped with a telescope larger than any other in the world. It was completed in 1888, and is 36 feet long and 57 inches in diameter. It is mounted so that it can be turned in every direction, and is placed in a building which revolves around the telescope, keeping the observer in the shade. ""The building is 140 feet in diameter, and is so high that one might almost imagine oneself inside of a cathedral. The floor is divided into two platforms, each of which is 24 feet above the ground, and both of which may be moved up and down. The great telescope itself stands upon the lower platform. The upper platform is fitted with instruments which are used for various purposes, and the building revolves around the telescope at such a rate that the observer on the upper platform may keep his instruments in the shade, so that they can be used for all purposes without being interfered with by the heat of the sun."" As Mr. Lockyer thinks that life exists upon Mars, so he is also inclined to believe that there are living beings upon the planet Venus."	1911	1880.192
"As I looked up at one of the windows, a lady in a white dress and blue sash passed behind the blind. I could see her profile. She was looking at a man who was speaking to her, a man who had come into the room from the door behind her. I could see the smile in her attitude, her hands, her hair, her very dress. She was listening, and the man who was speaking to her was smiling too. I felt the dry shivering of the wolf who sees the sheepfold in the distance. I turned my head away from the light. I should have turned my head away from that smile if I d been within reach of it. I stooped, and picked up a stone. I was going to throw it through the window. I felt that I must do something, do anything, to get rid of that smiling pair. But just as I raised my hand a big motor drove past the house, and the light in the window went out. A moment afterwards the door opened, and the lady came out on to the dark street, followed by the man who had been talking to her. My hand fell. "" By Jove, "" I said to myself, "" she looks like a lady ! "" The lady climbed into the motor, and the man got up on the box beside the fat chauffeur."	1906	1966.4697
"1912. — There is an abundance of wit and humour in this book, but its characterisation is not its strongest feature. The type of the protagonist is very familiar and there is little that is new in the manner of presenting it, although the particular man chosen to represent it is an unusual one. Professor S. Morton Sloane, a precociously gifted botanist, is at once the butt and the life of a university. He is so absorbed in his work that he has no time to be either a ""sport"" or a professor in the ordinary meaning of the term. Yet his eccentricities and his unintentional but unerring ability to make people ridicule themselves do not keep him from being worshipped by the young women students. The story begins with the professor's accident in a cab. He is carried to the hospital, delirious, where, in a series of amusing incidents, he becomes involved in the trial of a murder case. When he recovers, he refuses to go to the police station to identify the real criminal, a forlorn yellow dog, because he is too busy studying the effects of delirium tremens upon plants. He is rescued from his self imposed task by his friends, who take him to a quiet country place, where, after many amusing adventures, he finds the time to straighten out the mystery and to save the girl, who, of course, he loves. The book is not a detective story, although it contains many elements of one, and it is a pleasant bit of light reading, enlivened by the introduction of a very human dog."	1911	1926.2599
The Club House is the resort of the best society, and the ladies who drive out to the matches in their smart dog carts are a sight worth seeing. Very few of the ladies play cricket. Football is a winter pastime in which the British element indulge with great spirit. Racing is also a British passion, and the racecourse lies in the direction of Newlands, at a place called Kenilworth, which is also very beautiful, and contains the Kenilworth Hotel, where you have a fine view of the Mountain, and can see the running of the horses after a short walk. The races are a great event in the society calendar, and there are races of various kinds at different times in the year, but the Cape Derby and Cape Grand National are the chief.	1908	1887.4152
"Bay City, Michigan The Socialists elected the mayor and four out of six members of the council at the spring election in 1911. The victory was made possible by fusion of the Socialists with the prohibitionists and with a big part of the labor vote. The party programme is very sensible. It promises: ""To bring about a cordial relation between the citizens and the city officials, and to root out the feeling that the officials are only 'out for what they can get.' "" The council meets every Tuesday evening and is open to the public. In line with its platform the city has started a public market. The public ownership of utilities is being tried out at Bay City. A municipal gas plant is in process of construction. It is confidently expected that this will be a success in every way, financially and otherwise. As much public sentiment as possible will be educated in favour of municipally owned street railways and approximately all utilities. The present management of the electric light plant and of the waterworks will be permitted to prove how well they can manage those plants, and if they do not prove to the satisfaction of the citizens that they are doing well, then the Socialists will try to get control of those plants. But the Republicans and Democrats are very well satisfied with the present management and would oppose such a move as public ownership of the electric plant and the waterworks. In January, 1912, the Socialists, with a big part of the labour vote, again elected the mayor and a majority of the council. Mayor Sweeney was re-elected by a majority of 184. The four Socialists who were re-elected to the council received from 188 to 228 majority."	1911	1928.0116
This is the only body, except the earth, that has a satellite whose apparent period is less than the time of rotation on the axis of the planet. The second moon, Deimos, is 2 2 miles in diameter, and takes 30 hours and 18 minutes to complete a revolution, but, owing to the movement of Mars on its axis, it appears to take 58 hours and 42 minutes, or almost three times as long as Phobos. The apparent and real motions of these moons are shown in Fig. 58. THE SPECTROSCOPE. The spectroscope is an instrument for examining the spectrum of a body, and is made by placing a prism or prisms in the path of the beam of light, so that the light is refracted through the prism or prisms, and is then received on a suitable screen or plane of glass, so that the different rays are separated by refraction.	1911	1927.0756
In the garden proper there are flowers, of course, but these are not so much cultivated as left to themselves. The most beautiful wild flowers are always those which are least cared for. The garden is of a size to be looked after by the womenfolk and the children. The men are too busy with the farm. Yet there is always time to keep a patch of flowers near the house, to adorn the table and the mantelpiece, to cheer and brighten the home. In golden weather a field of sunflowers is a sight to be remembered. It is a sight you may see in the Colony, but you will see it nowhere else. Sunflowers there are in other lands, but they are a modest plant. In the Colony they are a giant.	1908	1904.4913
"Our debate was held January 30th, in the auditorium of the Lincoln High School, and was probably attended by about two thousand people. The judges were three members of the faculty of the Lincoln High School. I am sorry to say that the negative party won. The judges said they did not think Proportional Representation would work in America, and I am sorry to say that the general opinion of our audience was with the judges. However, we had some very strong arguments, based largely on the literature you sent us. Our main points were: I. The great advantage of having a legislature that would be a real representative body. II. The elimination of the ""wasted vote."" III. The securing of a majority for each candidate. IV. The advantage of a minority party in having a voice in legislation. V. The success of the plan in other countries. I made a special study of point No. 5, and I am convinced that the success of Proportional Representation elsewhere is a great argument for it here. I am sorry the plan was not successful, but I am glad we had the opportunity to debate it, and I am very grateful to you for your help. Very truly yours, John Bovingdon."" A Paper on Proportional Representation in the University of Washington The ""Daily"" of the University of Washington, at Seattle, Washington, contains a paper by a student, Mr. W. J. Campbell, advocating Proportional Representation, to which the following letter was sent in reply: ""Dear Mr. Campbell: I want to thank you very much for your editorial in the 'Daily' of January 21st."	1911	1911.7914
"Thus was Mrs. Paicey, who was the mother of five, and the mother-in-law of three, and the grandmother of seven, under fire. "" I should say, "" went on Mrs. Peppercorn, "" that it will be the same as if Miss Fallowfield was the parson's wife. A widow woman is only a sort of old maid with a little more experience; and I should say, she is like to be as bossy and dictatorial as Miss Fallowfield."" "" Why, to be sure, "" said Mrs. Paicey, who had an understanding with her neighbour, and who, on the whole, was inclined to endorse her views; "" I should say, that to be sure."" "" And, "" continued Mrs. Peppercorn, "" a woman that has been married and has lost her husband — a sort of second edition of an old maid — I should not call her a very desirable sort of person. She is just as likely as not to come here with her notions all upset by her loss, and perhaps thinking that because she has been a parson's wife, she ought to be treated as a sort of lady by all and sundry. I have seen a good many of that sort of women, and I should not call them agreeable."" "" Well, I should say, "" put in Mrs. Paicey, "" that to be sure."""	1908	1891.5652
The history of the street lanterns was as follows : About 1660 or 1665, Charles II. was petitioned by the citizens of London to permit the lighting of the streets. The petition was referred to two bishops, who were Judges for the time, and they held that such an innovation would lead to immorality, and Charles II. said it would have the effect of leading people to the theatres, and that therefore it should not be allowed. About the year 1690 the matter was mooted again, and Charles II. said that the lighting of the streets might be permitted, but that the expense was to fall upon the parishioners. In consequence of this, parish after parish had a lantern, the Parish Constable being responsible for looking after the lanterns and having charge of the lamps. The Council of Dublin was the first to make provision for street lighting, and that was in 1708. The first lantern on record in Aberdeen was in 1740, and street lighting was not taken up seriously in Edinburgh until about the time the Union Street lanterns went up in Aberdeen, which was about 1811 or 1812. The question as to whether gas or oil would be the cheaper was a very vexed one for a long time after the introduction of gas. In some localities it was thought that gas was cheaper, but generally oil was used.	1912	1876.786
"The monkeys are the only ones of the lot which do not seem contented; they chatter incessantly, and seem to be cursing the day on which they were captured. As the market opens, the canoes are emptied and their burden carried up the slippery, moss covered stones to the stalls, which are shaded from the sun by gay ""tapa"" awnings. The Tapa cloth is made by the natives from the bark of the mulberry tree. First the bark is beaten out to a thin sheet, then designs are stamped on it with a dye made from the juice of the candlenut, and the cloth is then dried in the sun. The designs are made to repeat, and the awnings are therefore made up of a number of pieces sewn together. They are very brilliant in colour, and serve to make the market place a gay spot. Here we bought yams, taro, sweet potatoes, bananas, mangoes, limes, and many things which we did not know the names of. The yams are very large, some weighing as much as 150 pounds. They are dug up in the mountains and brought down to the beach by the natives, where they are loaded into the canoes and brought to the market. The taro is grown in the marshy land along the beach, and is the staple food of the natives."	1913	1875.934
"Physiologists maintained that the secretion of saliva is independent of the act of mastication and of the presence of food in the mouth. This opinion was based on experiments made on dogs which had been deprived of their salivary glands. The animals were fed with food which could not be chewed, as, for instance, well boiled rice. There was no secretion of saliva during mastication. When the food was swallowed, however, and the ' chewed ' food was in the stomach, the saliva began to flow and continued to flow for a considerable time. Practitioners of medicine, on the contrary, maintained that the presence of food in the mouth, and especially the act of mastication, calls forth a flow of saliva, and they based their opinion on the behaviour of healthy persons."""	1911	1923.5745
"Do you think my boy was insane?"" Mrs. Garvin asked. Mr. Lee said he thought not, but it was for the courts to so decide. ""If he was insane, "" said Mrs. Garvin, "" it was for the state to take care of him, not for private interests to kidnap him."" She sent a new petition to the War Department, asking continuance of the search, but on different grounds. In May, she lost the one companion of the past years that had lightened her burden. She was now alone, a feeble old woman, and the War Department and the State of New York were her only hope. In July, the War Department's investigation ended, and a letter was received telling her the result. [ 319 ] In October, she had a last and final interview with Attorney Lee, in his office in Troy. "" You might go to the War Department in Washington, "" he said, "" and petition the Secretary of War to reopen the case ; but it will do no good. The government has spent a great deal of time and money investigating this case, and it has washed its hands of it ; you will get no satisfaction there."" After that, Mrs. Garvin never spoke Con's name or mentioned his case. She silently accepted the fate that had come to her, just as she had silently borne the burdens that had been thrust upon her."	1913	1920.9159
"When he is really in earnest, and not merely indulging in some passing provocation, he has a way of putting his finger on the spot that is telling, and a way of saying what he means that is simple and direct. The following passages will give some idea of his style, and of the interest and importance of the ideas he is trying to express. And they will help us to understand his conception of the man of the future, the Ubermensch. ""The noble type of man feels himself to be a determiner of values, he does not require anyone to teach him to esteem, he esteems of himself, he creates values. He honours his superior, he honours even his inferior, he honours in himself the authority of the order of rank. ""He is a creator of sacred things, he is a sacred writer, he is a lawgiver; he is a creator of himself."" ""The noble type of man believes in himself, in himself as a creator, in his self created."" The noble type of man has reverence for himself, and hence reverence for everything about him. ""The noble type of man reverences himself, in himself he reverences first of all his ruling power, the power of determining values, of honouring, of creating, of liberating, of ruling."	1913	1881.1367
Wonders of embryology, structure and habits in their bounteous variety and great age, fossil invertebrate and vertebrate skeletons, all clamoured for investigation and often had to be refused because of the impossibility of giving them the needed attention. In this period, which may be designated as the period of specialisation, the last forty years of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth, the great problems of zoology that had to do with origin, descent, evolution, have attracted the largest number of workers, and have absorbed the most time and attention. During this time the effects of the division of labour have been remarkable. Many lines of research have been pursued with great success. Many truths have been established and a vast fund of information has been accumulated. But with the increasing complexity of the problems, and the growing specialisation of the workers, the outlook has become more and more discouraging. Some biologists even question whether general principles can be obtained or general truths discovered in the presence of such overwhelming diversity, such manifold variation, and apparently inextricable complexity. I do not hold this view, but I am convinced that the days of specialisation are over and that we are entering upon a period, which I hope will be long and fruitful, of co-operation, of bringing our special knowledge together, of mutual dependence and mutual assistance, of generalisation. The past generation of zoologists, and especially the American zoologists of this generation, have made astonishing progress in the accumulation of facts.	1911	1932.8615

Now the present situation is this : in the majority of trade unions the worker is debarred from this ultimate freedom ; he cannot transfer himself to another trade union without the permission of the one to which he belongs. If he does so transfer himself without permission, he is liable to be fined for breach of contract ; moreover, he is liable to be blacklisted by the trade union from which he has left without permission. This blacklisting means that, although he may belong to the new trade union to which he has transferred himself, he will not get work, as no employer will take the risk of taking a worker who is blacklisted by his former trade union. In this way the worker is completely fettered, and is in a worse position than a serf, for a serf could change his master. Now, what is the position of the trade union movement in regard to this state of affairs ? The trade unions are in favour of this state of affairs, and are fighting for it. The latest development of the trade union movement is that the trade unions are trying to get the state to back them in this system of slavery. At the present moment the trade unions are trying to get a clause inserted in the new Trade Union Bill which will legalise this system of slavery. This clause will exempt the trade unions from responsibility for any illegal acts committed by them in enforcing this system of slavery.	1911	1932.1195
"Those who believe in self-government must accept responsibility for their acts. Many citizens are unwilling to assume responsibility for the government they control and which they created, but adopt the attitude of the boy who went hunting with his father's gun. The boy and the gun were lost and upon their return home a search was instituted for them. The father asked, ""Why didn't you fire the gun?"" To which the boy replied, ""I didn't know how."" The father said, ""Then don't be such a blamed fool as to go hunting with a gun you cannot load."" So with citizens who believe in the initiative but not in the recall. The chief fault with many of our present day citizens is that they go hunting for good government and initiate measures without having loaded their brains. The initiative is a gradual and sure way of securing legislation desired by the people, but is slow and tedious when the people desire to change the personnel of public servants."	1911	1937.9729
"They ask, in one word, for something like the justice which the British nation prides itself on giving to every human being within its reach. The reply which will be given in England to these prayers will decide not only the future of British rule in India, but also the stability of the British Empire. I have not the shadow of a doubt in my own mind as to what the reply ought to be. But it seems to me that the answer of the Indian National Congress is final and conclusive. It was given at the Hyderabad meeting for the first time in a definite form, and should be proclaimed from the house tops. It was this: — ""It is now abundantly clear that no hope can be entertained of attaining the desired constitutional changes by pacific and loyal means ; and an innate sense of justice, and the inalienable right of the people to participate in the shaping of their own destinies, demand that the problem should no longer be approached from that one sided standpoint of the ruling and ruled, which fails to recognise that the two are partners in the administration of the country."	1914	1890.1077
"This is true, e. g. of the ultra red rays, they react upon (are brought into chemical change by) rays of much longer wave length than can be refracted by the most powerful prism. There are, then, in the ultra red region of the spectrum rays which we cannot see, but which act powerfully upon materials used in photography. Very many of these chemical rays have been registered in the region just beyond the visible part of the spectrum, viz. between 760/ji/i and 1000/|4/i, and the ultra violet rays have also been registered as far as 100/|i/i. Materials are known which react much more strongly than our photographic plates do upon these rays. The term "" chemical rays "" is consequently much abused, being applied to rays in a certain range of the spectrum only, while in fact they go beyond this and include rays which we cannot see and which, so far as we know at present, cannot be used to form photographs."	1912	1929.4586

The melting point is at 69 to 70° C. Lecithine dissolves readily in dilute alkaline solutions, and also in concentrated solutions of sodium carbon¬ ate or of phosphates; not decomposed by boiling. With acetic anhydride it forms a true acetic acid ester as was shown by Gilson, who obtained from it a precipitable compound with platin chlorid and an oil with mercury oleate. The analysis gave the following results: I. II. Not determin’d. Acetic ester 9.16 9.38 9.23 Acid 13.29 13.66 13.18 Alkaline solution 0.81 0.84 0.79 Chlorin 0.19 0.18 0.18 16.46 16.74 16.54 97.4 99.2 99.4 These results come to over 99 percent. ; therefore it is impossible to assume, as Gilson did, that the compound is a true acid ester and that one atom of the hydroxyl in the glyceryl radicle is replaced. If one assumes that two atoms of hydroxyl are replaced, and therefore that the lecithine is a so-called diacetin, the formula will be: C2H4O2CI2+2HC1=C2H3O2Cl+ HCC1- Therefore, if x represents the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in excess over that in acetic acid, we have: 2 2 + x= 16.46 16.74 16.54 2x= 4.74 4.94 4.84 x=l.72 1.72 1.72 i.e., x=1.72 or 1.72/2=0.86; then the formula will be: In view of the fact that lecithine does not readily take up acid chlorids, but forms esters when heated with anhyd	1913	1944.8276
Later on I had the advantage of the advice of several military and naval experts, who, after reading the manuscript, were kind enough to pass the work as being within the bounds of practical possibilities. The book, it must be understood, is not a war study, but merely a study of invasion. In it I have deliberately refrained from dealing with the question of how the fleet would be manned, or how we shall be able to feed the army, or how the army will be transported. Such matters do not concern an invasion study, and may be left to the military experts to discuss. Suffice it to say that in the chapters dealing with the transport of the army across the Channel, and its distribution over English soil, I have taken the opinion of several high naval officers, and have acted strictly upon their advice.	1906	1888.0222
We must somehow get out of the habit of treating all race differences as obstacles to be despised or to be overcome by a rigidly utilitarian policy. There still exists, even in some English officials and in their chosen subordinates, as well as among the higher classes of Indians, that sense of the spiritual kinship of the British and Indian peoples which Lord Curzon felt so strongly and which the late Sir John Strachey so eloquently described. The bond so well recognised by these statesmen is never mentioned by our modern school of Indian politicians. In protest against their indifference, and as an evidence that they are not alone in the opinion which they seem to regard as novel and revolutionary, I add this short quotation from Sir John Strachey's essay on the success and the permanence of our rule.	1908	1896.2179
The calcite and apatite do not occur in such deposits in definite crystals, but only as irregularly shaped masses or veins. The apatite is of a reddish colour, and is often found enclosed between two sheets of phlogopite. Calcite and apatite are therefore later than the phlogopite, but the relation of these two minerals to the pyroxene is not yet definitely known. The pyroxene is later than the phlogopite in the Pigeon Hill deposits, but in the Mount Marie deposits, where the pyroxene is a diopside, the relation is just the reverse, the diopside being later than the phlogopite. In the Mount Rose deposits both minerals are found in a network, and in some places the phlogopite is on the outside of the crystal, while in other places it is on the inside. This would indicate that the two minerals are contemporaneous, but such a network is not a rare phenomenon in pegmatitic deposits, and is no proof of contemporaneous crystallisation. The fact that the phlogopite is later than the diopside in some deposits, and contemporaneous with it in others, is probably due to the different source of the magma. It is evident that the pyroxene is derived from one of the normal types of igneous rocks, while the phlogopite is derived from a more basic magma.	1905	1895.2124
""" But, Dagmar, the life of the monastery is so beautiful — the poverty and the prayer and the seclusion from the world.

The you that comes out in the world, and has worldly interests and worldly pleasures, and worldly ambitions, and worldly distractions, and is subject to worldly influences, is only the superficial outward envelope of you."	1908	1900.1962
The view from the top of the Katberg is magnificent. We were there just before sunset, and the whole panorama was bathed in a golden light. The great escarpment of the Drakensberg was in front of us, and we felt that we were now indeed in the land of the Amatola, of the Zuurberg, of the Katberg, of the Stormberg, of the Drakensberg. The mountains were not so far away as we had thought. The great grey mass of the Drakensberg had been visible for a long time, and now we were to see the whole range, from the Zuurberg on the left to the Stormberg on the right. The mountains were not so far away as we had thought. The great grey mass of the Drakensberg had been visible for a long time, and now we were to see the whole range, from the Zuurberg on the left to the Stormberg on the right. We camped at the top of the pass, and I was glad to have this opportunity of taking a photograph of the wagon. The road was in excellent condition, and the weather was simply perfect. I had always imagined that the Katberg was a mountain, not a pass, but I was now to see that it is really a mountain, standing out as a prominent feature in the Amatola range.	1908	1908.649
Consequently, colour is a great enemy. Now, however, it is known that colour in glass is due to the presence of metallic oxides. Gold gives ruby glass, and colloidal gold gives the ruby lustre observed on some porcelain and faience. It is known that the absorption of light by a glass depends not merely on the amount of an oxide present, but also on the valency of the ions. For example, a small quantity of manganese present in a glass gives rise to a large absorption of light, because the manganese is present in the bivalent condition. If, however, the manganese is present in the quadrivalent condition, as in the famous manganese glass of Chance's, the absorption is small, and indeed the oxide is a decolouriser. The blue colour given to glass by cobalt oxide is due to the presence of cobalt in the quadrivalent condition. An important means of ascertaining the valency of ions in glass is afforded by the spectrum method. For this purpose a very thin shard of glass is placed in front of a narrow slit in the yellow flame of a Bunsen burner. The light is then analysed by means of a prism or grating spectroscope, and the spectrum is examined for dark bands, indicating the absorption of particular rays by the glass. It was known that the spectra of colourless and of coloured glasses are different, and that the bands of the spectrum due to the absorption of rays by the particles of colouring 192  matter in the glass are regularly shifted to shorter wave lengths as the glass is heated.	1912	1912.3868
"I can't see why you should be so dreadfully down on Aunt Dagmar, "" Dagmar said to Claude the night before the departure for the summer colony; "" why, you are just as bad as she is. You both pretend to be so frightfully interested in the poor old things that live at the Farm. You are always bringing them things, and you know how Aunt Dagmar hates to see any one eat in hot weather. And you both pretend to be so interested in the flowers and vegetables at the Farm, and you know that Father never has any interest in things of that sort. You are both just humbugging to get him away from us, and to make us miserable, and to make each other miserable."""	1908	1912.039
"As I have said before, I cannot take a very serious view of the matter, for the simple reason that I have not met with the women who are suffering from the conditions. But I am aware that there are some who are, and I know that they are to be found in the industrial centres of the country. There is a great deal of talk about the ""super"" woman, but I am afraid that the majority of women are of the ""sub"" variety, and that there is not much hope of the former being produced under the conditions which are so prevalent today. The question of the ""super"" man is a little more complicated, for the reason that he is usually a ""sub"" before he is one of the ""super"" variety, and the chances of his being a ""super"" after he has been a ""sub"" are not very great."	1911	1902.5946
""" Well, it is a proof of nothing of the kind, "" I replied; "" it is simply evidence that the canals are being extended.""

"" You are correct, "" I answered; "" but that is no reason why we should not continue to state the truth, and to uphold it with all the arguments in our power.""

"If the historian is to serve the interest of social solidarity, he must equip his readers with the scientific understanding of the present, the interpretative imagination of the past, and the prophetic insight of the future. These three gifts are those of the seer, and the historian who thus qualifies himself and his readers is he who, in the words of F. W. H.

"The Milky Way or Galaxy is composed of a multitude of suns, which, while they are so distant that they appear to us only as stars, are really like our sun in every respect. The apparent stars in the Milky Way are not all equally distant from us ; some are much nearer and some much farther than others, and in doing the same duty of illuminating the heavens they are subject to different degrees of absorption by the vapours and particles of matter which they have to traverse. The Milky Way is formed of stars so numerous and so close together that we cannot distinguish them as individuals, but only as a luminous cloud ; and, as Sir Robert Ball says, "" A slight inspection of the Milky Way will show that it has a decided and marked structure."	1911	1876.061
25 cc. of the same acetic anhydride is measured out with a graduated pipette and introduced into each flask, the one for control being first weighed. The flasks are then shaken and allowed to stand in a warm place for 15 hours, when they are again weighed and the weight of the acetic anhydride that has been absorbed by the soda determined. The excess of acetic anhydride in the control flask, that has not been absorbed by the soda, is then determined by titration with half normal hydrochloric acid to phenolphthalein. 100 parts of acetic anhydride that has been absorbed by the soda corresponds to 75 parts of triacetin formed. In the above method the amount of soda used is 25 cc. of half normal solution or 1.25 grms. The amount of acetic anhydride used is 25 cc. of 10 percent solution or 2.5 grms. The amount of acetic anhydride that has been absorbed by the soda is then 2.5 — x grms., and the amount of triacetin formed is 75 — x grms. If 100 parts of acetic anhydride absorbed by the soda corresponds to 75 parts of triacetin formed, then 2.5 — x parts of acetic anhydride absorbed by the soda corresponds to 75 (2.5 — x) /100 parts of triacetin formed.	1913	1929.9717
This is made by dissolving one part of gum mastic in two parts of turpentine. Flow a little of it on the negative and spread it with a piece of clean glass or celluloid. It should be very thin, and if it is too thick it will show brush marks and will peel off. The object of this varnish is to protect the film from grease and scratches, and not to give a ground for working on. It is not necessary to use it on the glass of the negative, but it is better to do so. When it is dry, which is in a few minutes, the retouching may be started. The first thing to do is to look over the negative carefully and see where the blemishes are.	1912	1929.224
The errors are particularly grave in the case of the brain, since a large part of the phosphorus present in that tissue is present as phosphoprotein and not as lecithine. The work of Hammarsten and of Thudichum has also shown that the term lecithine is applied to a number of different substances, and that there is no grounds for the assumption that these different substances can be represented by the one formula given above. These considerations led us to attempt to isolate and identify the different phosphorised fats present in the brain. The method of extraction was that which we had previously found best for the extraction of the phosphorised fats from the liver. The brain was obtained from a calf about one month old, and after being freed from blood and connective tissue was cut into small pieces and dried in an air bath at 40° C. for 48 hours. The brain when dried weighed 2150 grams. 1 Z. physiol. Chem., 16, 307 (1862). 2 Z. physiol. Chem., 16, 321 (1862). 3 Z. physiol. Chem., 18, 1 (1863). 4 Z. physiol.

"At each change a new pose was taken, and every one was good — very good. Not because the figures were well posed, though they were that, but because of the fact that every position was well lighted. Every operator knows how difficult it often is to induce a subject to change its pose when the light is right. One of the cardinal principles of moving picture photography is variety of view. The average laugh producing short subjects contain too many views taken in two or three positions and angles. Many a good scene is spoiled by such ""sticking "" of views and nothing helps to make them appear artificial as does the repetition of the same angle of view with people going through different actions with only slight changes in the figures."	1912	1940.1737
The most important school of philosophy in Europe in the thirteenth century was the scholastic school, conducted under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. The leader and chief figure of this school was Thomas Aquinas, who was born at Aquino in Italy in 1225, and died at Fossanuova in 1274. He was a monk of the order of St. Benedict, and his life was spent in the service of the Church. He was a man of prodigious learning, and had a clear and powerful intellect, but he wasted his great powers on the unimportant and trivial questions of the dialectics and metaphysics of the day. He attempted to reconcile the teachings of Aristotle with the doctrines of the Christian Church. He accepted the four causes of Aristotle, and made them the basis of his entire philosophy. These four causes are the material cause, the formal cause, the efficient cause, and the final cause. The material cause answers the question, What is it made of? The formal cause, What is its form? The efficient cause, What made it? And the final cause, What is its purpose or end? The first three of these causes are now known as the mechanical causes, and the last one as the teleological cause. The mechanical causes are now regarded as the causes of the scientist, and the teleological cause as the cause of the philosopher.	1911	1892.6844
"It is a hymn of creation, a Hebrew ""Fauna and Flora."" The heavens are telling the glory of God, And the firmament showeth His handiwork. The day is telling it unto the day, And the night unto the night, And there is no speech nor language, Their voice is not heard. Yet their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath He set a tabernacle for the sun, Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a giant to run his course. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, And his circuit unto the ends of it: And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes: The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: The ordinances of the Lord are true and righteous altogether: More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. Moreover by them is Thy servant warned: In keeping them there is great reward. The psalm ends in a deeply religious spirit, with a prayer for purity and acceptance."	1908	1870.0272
The commission will meet daily and it is expected that regular sessions will be held at 2 o'clock every afternoon. It is planned to have the meetings open to the public. The commission will hold its first meeting in the mayor's office. The most important question to be settled is that of organisation and the assignment of duties. The members are all agreed, however, that the commission will have to work as a unit. The commission will act as a board and not as separate heads of departments. The question of chief engineer, chief of police and chief of fire department will be settled later. Chief Stout, of the present police department, has expressed a desire to remain under the new government. The new fire chief will probably be selected from the present department. The commission is expected to cut down the number of employes in all departments, and it is believed that the new government will effect a saving of from $50,000 to $75,000 a year. Just what the duties of each commissioner will be has not yet been decided, but it is believed that the president will have general supervision of all departments. The new commission will be aided in its administration by a number of boards and commissions, which will be retained. These are the Board of Health, Board of Assessment, Board of Water Commissioners, Board of Excise, Board of Education, Board of Street and Sewer Commissioners and the Board of Recreation Commissioners.	1911	1927.412
Cold light has also been applied to the lighting of theatres, and the effect is most beautiful. The first experiment was made in the theatre at Metz, where the electric light is produced by a tiny dynamo worked by a bicycle. The apparatus has since been improved, and in the new Paris Opera House it is employed to light up the stage. The cold light is now being made in larger sizes, and it will shortly be possible to use it for street lighting. The first experiment in this direction has been made in the Rue de la Paix, Paris, where, for a short time, the cold light was employed in the shop windows. But the great advantage of cold light is that it can be produced at a trifling cost. At present a light that will cost about $1 a day can be produced for 50 cents a day. In the case of the cold light at Metz, the cost of production is only 2 cents an hour. Thus, in the future, when cold light is produced on a large scale, it will be possible to have a street lamp for the same sum that one now pays for gas to light a room for two hours. And then what a glorious light it will be! HOW THE SUN IS MADE TO SPEAK. The Sun's rays, concentrated by a glass lens, will burn paper, or even wood, but a similar concentration of rays by a parabolic mirror will not only burn, but will melt and vaporise metals. The rays, falling on the focus of the mirror, are there intensified to such an extent that the temperature is far higher than that of the surface of the sun.	1913	1896.1576
The different machines shown in the other figures would, of course, have to be arranged according to the particular work they are required for, but the general description given above would still apply. 1 Fig. 10. — Arrangement of Type Setting and Casting Machines. 2 Fig. 11. — Arrangement of Type Setting and Casting Machines. The chief point to be considered in the arrangement of any group of machines is that there should be a free approach to all the machines, both for the operator and for the workmen who have to supply them with type and materials, and to remove the finished work. In this respect Fig. 10 is the best, as the only approach to the left hand machines is from the back. In Fig. 11 the centre machines are approached from the front and back. A second point is that the machines should be arranged so that the operator does not have to turn round to see the supply of type, etc. This is especially important in the case of the casting machines, as the operator has to keep a constant watch on the supply of metal, and it is very disconcerting to have to turn his back on the work in hand. The third point is that the supply of type, etc., should be as near as possible to the machines, as it is very tiring to have to stretch out the arms or walk any distance for the materials.	1912	1927.4929

""" I see, "" exclaimed the Professor.

The most important event of the year has been the formation of the Illuminating Engineering Society, which has taken over the work of the Association of Illuminating Engineers and the London and Provincial Electrical Association, and has been formed in response to the growing demand for a society which will embrace all branches of the subject. The Society has already a membership of over 600, and although it has been formed only a few weeks, it is already clear that it will be able to do much more work than the Associations which have preceded it. An important step was the appointment of committees to deal with the questions of Standard Gas Flames and the Standard Candle Power of Electric Lamps. These committees were formed at a meeting held on Dec. 15th. The question of the standard gas flame has been under the consideration of a committee of the Association of Illuminating Engineers for some time, but no satisfactory result had been arrived at. It is now hoped that under the new Society the question may be settled. The committee is composed as follows : — Messrs. W. H. B. Anderson, J. W. Brodie, H. J. Campbell, W. H. C. Foulkes, H. A. Houghton, J. Lewis, A. M. Matthews, W. H. Moore, C. B. Raymond, H. Roberts, E. R. Spencer, C. H. Stock, and the Secretary.	1912	1923.7341
In this total is included a decrease in homicide from 92 to 77, one of the smallest annual totals on record. Homicide is, however, so rare an occurrence that the annual figures almost necessarily vary considerably from year to year. A striking fall is also to be noted in aggravated assault, which in 1904 numbered 373 as compared with 490 in the previous year, a decrease of nearly 24 percent. The decrease in crime against the person is specially noteworthy in view of the fact that a great increase was found last year in this class of offences. The explanation of the unusual rise in 1903, and of the still more unusual decline in 1904 is to be found in the annual report of the Inspector of Constabulary.	1907	1949.5903
55 The difference between the spread at positions (5) and (7) will be noted, although the dewpoint is the same in both cases. The specific humidity at (5) is 59.5 percent, at (7) only 36.2 percent. The return journey of the parcel is indicated by the letters (8) to (9). Heating and decrease in dewpoint i result in an enormous decrease in spread. The change in dewpoint from (8) to (9) is 10 degrees. Any cloud existing at (8) would be very much stratified. Crossing the snow covered plateau, cooling occurs but, due to the higher dewpoint at (8), the spread remains unchanged. At (10) the parcel enters the windward slope of the hill. Cooling occurs and, as the dewpoint has not been affected, the spread decreases. The humidity has reached 100 percent, condensation has occurred, the air is saturated. The parcel is now at the cloud top. At (12) the mountain has been surmounted. The parcel is now on its way down to the lee slope. As now the dewpoint is higher, the spread increases. The temperature will not be affected seriously by this small descent. The moisture lost by the cloud is given in the following table: Miles Cloud Droplet Size, Microns Distance Dropped Droplet Size, Microns Elapsed Time, Min. Wind Velocity, Mi. 1.5 Cloud Fraction Droplet Size, Microns Distance Dropped Droplet Size, Microns Elapsed Time, Min.	1913	1945.3379
True, he had been legally adopted by the old lady, while Dagmar had only been a ward or protege. But, on the other hand, she had been the first to incur Miss Fallowfield's displeasure, and had certainly been cast off by her. Claude could not see why he, who had never incurred his benefactress's displeasure, should be the one to suffer, and Dagmar be the one to profit, by her death. He had but one argument to support his contention, and that was the fact that Dagmar stood so much more to gain by her money than he did. He had so little to lose by its absence that he could not afford to deny himself the pleasure of her society, in the present at any rate. In the future, when he should be settled in a profession, it would be different, and he felt sure that if need be, Dagmar would be perfectly satisfied that he should accept the small amount of his foster mother's legacy that was legally his. But Dagmar was not satisfied. It was not that she could not bear to think of Claude losing even a fraction of his rights. It was because she could not bear a single shadow to dim the brightness of the happiness she felt was within her reach. She could see that Claude was not so much concerned about the money question as he had been at first, and that he was only anxious that she should have her share, because he feared she could not be happy without it.	1908	1882.3593
"The meaning of each of the letters is made clear by a reference to Fig. 7. A discussion of the stability of a dirigible follows, and the general conclusion is arrived at that a small angular displacement from the equilibrium position will produce a couple tending to increase the displacement. Hence the dirigible is "" unstable "" in the sense that it will not maintain a straight course in a wind. Finally, the case of a dirigible of revolution is treated in some detail, and the following results are obtained : — (1) The yawing couple is independent of the speed, but depends on the inclination of the axis to the wind. (2) The pitching couple depends on the speed, being zero at zero speed, and tending to a limiting value as the speed becomes infinite."	1912	1902.3903
Even if they did not, however, the possibility of the existence of a protective enclosure with 1 Wallace, op. cit., p. 268. 2 Ibid., p. 272. 3 Ibid. , p. 273. which to guard the race of man, is suggested only by the fact that he is not exposed to the full effect of natural selection. In the past, and even at the present time so far as the savage races are concerned, he has been exposed to the direct influences of those agencies which, acting on individuals, produce evolution. These agencies have been constantly reducing the physical powers of the race and have been consequently calling for a constant increase in the mental powers, for a compensation, that is to say, in the faculty of intelligence for the loss of strength in the faculty of sensation.	1908	1915.8636
"The glass workers of this country are engaged in a most difficult and dangerous occupation. They must work in a place which is hotter than the average furnace, and which is filled with the most poisonous gases. They must handle molten glass, some of which is as hot as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. They work in teams, the average team consisting of six men, and in the course of a day's work each man passes back and forth from five to ten miles, carrying the glass from the furnace to the bench, and from the bench to the annealing lehr. The men who work in this way are the ""gob"" or ""shop"" workers. The others are known as the ""bench"" workers. They take the glass from the ""gob"" workers and mould it into the various shapes required. The glass workers belong almost exclusively to the Amalgamated Association of Glass Workers, one of the oldest and most thoroughly organised craft unions in the world. The men who run the furnaces and gather the glass are known as ""gob"" workers. The men who mould the glass into the various shapes required are known as ""bench"" workers. The moulding is done by hand, and the moulds used are made of cast iron, and are heated to a white heat in the annealing lehr, so that the glass is at all times as hot as the molten glass in the ""gob"" workers' hands."	1911	1896.0221

He was a master of the art of exposition as well as of the art of delusion.

But he never stooped to the artifice of concealing his own position under a disguise of expert testimony. He never made a false claim, nor allowed himself to be deluded or to delude others by false claims. By his insistence upon the necessity of standing to the full measure of one's responsibility, he did much to counteract the evils which flow from the habit of shifting one's responsibility on to the shoulders of nameless and faceless authorities. He had no sympathy with the efforts of those who were trying to square the facts of science with the requirements of the old theological and metaphysical systems, and he knew that it could be done only by a suppression of the facts of science."	1913	1919.6476
He was like a man, who, standing at the crossroads, has his eyes blinded by the light of one particular goal. The goal in this instance was the monastery. He was determined to take the first opportunity of going to the Father Abbot, and of asking to be allowed to take the preliminary steps which must be gone through before he could actually enter the monastery. He had made up his mind that this should not be put off till the end of the summer, but that it should be done at once. So he and Dagmar were discussing the important event one afternoon, after he had read the service to her in the little chapel at the Manor, and on which occasion he had chanced to read the very words which had been used by the monk whose sermon had made such an impression on Claude's mind.	1908	1909.2765
But it seems to me that the existence of a pension system, whether compulsory or voluntary, is a matter of such vast importance for the individual and for the community that it is worth a certain sacrifice. In the end, I believe the sacrifice will not be great. It is often urged that the young and the capable are penalised by the existence of a pension system. This may be true if the system is a bad one, but it need not be true if the system is a good one. It is true that the young and the capable do not receive the full benefit of the pension system, but it may be justly contended that the primary object of a pension system is not to benefit the young and the capable, but to provide for the aged and the incapacitated.	1911	1919.6399

8, permanent set is caused by the breaking down of the internal structure of a material. This may mean either a breaking of crystalline or fibrous bonds, or, more secondary, a change of position of the molecules or groups of molecules as a whole. In any case it would appear that it is the internal work done in the breaking down of these bonds that is responsible for the work done beyond the elastic limit. To illustrate we may consider a piece of rubber which obeys Hook's Law up to the breaking point. The strain energy stored per unit volume is represented in Fig. 47 by the area OABC. When the piece is released, the strain energy represented by the area OAED is all recovered, but the strain energy represented by the area BCED is lost, for the piece cannot regain its original length.	1908	1973.1976
Acting upon this feeling, upon the sense of spiritual dominion which never deserted him, Newman joined the evangelical wing of the Church of England; he took orders, and became known as a vigorous preacher. He was at that time, as he tells us, and as the phenomenon is not a little interesting, indifferent to aesthetic beauty and wholly averse to the worship of it. In 1826 he was appointed fellow of Oriel College, of which he became in turn tutor and senior dean. He was now about twenty-five, and was still a disciple of the evangelical camp. We can well imagine him as a young fellow at Oxford with his white face, his soft blue eyes, his black hair, his eager manner and unyielding positiveness, yet gentleness; rising even in those days to the realm of fine philosophy and wielding with authority the pen of the polemic.	1913	1867.7855
"It is only in the case of very small groups, such as the Jews of a particular ghetto, that composite photographs yield interesting results. The composite photograph is the most satisfactory method of obtaining a portrait of the typical American Indian. Galton thought that the method was not well adapted to the study of the physiognomy of the criminal, since the individual peculiarities of the lawbreaker are more intense than his racial traits, and the composite photograph would thus be dominated by the ""ghost of a trace"" of the individual. But it is not difficult to obtain a composite photograph of the typical criminal. The method has been employed by the police of Paris, and more recently by the police of New York, with the result that the composite portrait of the typical criminal is a bald, commonplace, uninteresting face, the very antithesis of the romantic conception of the outlaw."	1911	1944.6791
"""With all his knowledge of farming, however, he has no head for business. He is extremely simple minded, and not at all quick to notice things. For years my father has been his employer, and to Bets he has been a very good and kind one. Last autumn my father put him in charge of a large piece of land which the Society had acquired in another county — a county some distance from here. The land was almost entirely wild — full of scrub and bushes — and my father thought that Bets would enjoy the work of clearing it. It is hard work, but it is also very interesting work, and my father was sure that Bets would like it. "" This was in September. The land was not large, but it was very wild, and the work of clearing it would take the greater part of the autumn and winter. "" On Thanksgiving Day my father rode out there to see how the work was progressing. He took my mother with him, and I went along. I was a little boy at the time, not yet eleven, and I remember the day extremely well. The clearing had gone on splendidly, and Bets was in high spirits. He and his men had built a cabin on the land, and he was living there. "" My father was very much pleased, and he asked Bets how he liked the work."	1913	1904.5851
"It is a review of gaieties, spectacles and forms of entertainment too numerous to mention or to comprehend. There are three or four new spectacles each week, and each one is heralded in the Parisian manner as ""the greatest success of the season."" There are ballets, opera bouffes, vaudevilles, races of three-legged cats, dances of educated cockatoos, tableaux vivants, spectacles of wild West Indians, nigger minstrels, and so on without end. The tickets are sold at a reasonable price, varying to the extent of the importance and pretentiousness of the entertainment. The simplest, baldest performance of all, however, is that of the ""ladies"" and the ""gentlemen."" The ""ladies"" are the most charming type of French girls to be found anywhere in the world; the ""gentlemen"" are the most charming type of American newspaper men. The ""ladies"" have their heads, their hearts, their souls and their hands covered with beads of all sizes, shapes and colours, and their bodies are hidden by skirts of tinsel and other things which are not tinsel. The ""gentlemen"" are the same in Louis Quatorze costumes that they wore the first time, and the second time, and the third time, and almost every Sunday night when they are called for. In short, they are the ""gentlemen"" of some ten years ago, so far as material is concerned. The performance begins at midnight each Sunday, and goes on until dawn, when the Casino closes, and the multitude of theatregoers, tired but happy, disappear in the various conveyances which await them in the street."	1913	1888.3429

Lady Barbara is a woman of the world, and her one idea is to marry her niece to a wealthy man, no matter what his age. The story is told in the form of a diary, and is written with a delightful abandon. The heroine is a delightful mixture of French vivacity and innocence, and of Scotch shrewdness. She is a most lovable character. The story is full of the most amusing situations, and the book is one that will be read and re-read with the greatest pleasure. The author has a rare gift of humour, and her wit is of the highest quality. It is a book that cannot fail to please. The White Sister. By William John Locke. Cloth. Pp. 336. Price $1.25 net. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co. The White Sister by William John Locke is a story of the South, and the author has succeeded in giving to the book a most vivid atmosphere. The heroine is a Southern girl, who is forced to take the veil in a convent in Italy. The story of her life there, and of the outside world, is one that will hold the reader's interest from beginning to end. The author has a remarkable power of characterisation, and the people of the book are all very real.	1911	1890.0889
In France the death penalty has been restricted by law to murder and assassination. The commutation of death sentences by the President is not as frequent as formerly. However, in 1905 there were 103 death sentences of which 55 were commuted. During the session of the Chamber of Deputies for 1905 a bill was introduced prohibiting the death penalty in case the defendant should be insane, but it was not acted upon. The Socialists initiated a campaign for the abolition of the death penalty. They also took steps to have a referendum taken on this question, but without success. In England the death penalty is restricted by the Act of 1861 to murder, the former offences being no longer capital felonies. There has been much agitation for the abolition of the death penalty, especially among the Socialists and the Liberals. The Committee on Criminal Law Reform of the Liberal party earnestly recommend the abolition of the death penalty. Public opinion, however, is not yet ready for such a radical reform. In Russia the penal code contains a great many formerly capital offences which have been reformed out of the criminal law by successive ukases. The death penalty is now retained only for murder and treason. The Government does not carry on the campaign against the death penalty. This is due to the fact that a reactionary wave has swept over the empire since the disturbances of 1905. The death penalty is in great favour among the nobility and the well-to-do classes, who see in this penalty the best means of preserving their privileges and preventing a renewal of the disturbances of 1905.	1908	1926.9667
"They are crowns of promise. 3. There is one thing more. The vision must be acted upon. The crown must be fought for. It costs. Joseph had to pay a price, and so must we. A man is no better than his dreams; but he is no worse. Dreams do not make a man. They are only the means. The vision is a call to action. It is a summons to the battle of life. It is a trumpet blast, summoning a man to an inner conflict, to a warfare that is possibly fiercer than any that ever thunders on the field of human carnage. It is a challenge to fight, and a gift of strength to win. "" With all thy getting, get wisdom."" Wisdom is the ability wisely to choose our best purpose, and then to follow that choice with vigorous action. The price of wisdom is to fight the battle of life single handed and unafraid. It means the perseverance of faith in the face of obstacles. It means, when it is most difficult, ""never give in."" It means to be true to the visions of our youth, in the hour of our old age. This is the price of the crown of promise. This is the price that Joseph paid. It was no small price. It was a price that had to be paid in full before he could take the crown. It was a price consisting of hardships, temptations, and trials. It is the price that every man or woman must pay, if the crown of promise is to be won."	1908	1885.1743
A very good toning bath is made as follows: Gold 5 grains Sodium chloride 2 drachms Water 1 pint The gold chloride is made by dissolving 5 grains of gold in 5 ounces of aqua regia and diluting to 1 pint with water. The chloride of gold is the precipitate left on adding a few drops of hydrochloric acid to this mixture. The sodium chloride is common salt. The bath may be used at once, but it is better to keep it for a day or two. It may be used repeatedly, but to ensure a good tone always use fresh gold after toning four or five dozen prints. This bath is not affected by sulphide of ammonium, hence the prints may be sulphured after toning without change; in fact, they are much improved. The prints should be mounted on arrival at home, so that they may be kept flat. A very nice way to mount them is to pin them on plain cards and cover with celluloid or glass. This method gives very nice effect, especially with a dark background. If a large number have to be done, a good method is to mount them in frames behind glass. In this case matting, or a border cut out of card or paper may be used to enclose the picture.	1912	1946.4335
"If she were a queen in exile, or a beggar woman, it could only add to the interest. And she had such a peculiar way of looking at him. It was like the glance of a bird of prey, and yet, after all, it was not cruel, but rather amused and slightly contemptuous, as if she were saying to herself, "" How utterly he believes in me!"" And then again the pictorial effect of her dress and his. The contrast was delightful. She was so cool in her violets, and he so warm in his reds and yellows. And then the table decoration — how exquisite! The tiny white and yellow roses in the centre of the table, and the great clusters of the dark red ones against the green wall behind. And the bright blue and yellow and purple of the plates hung round the room — how it all harmonised! Paul felt a rush of gratitude to the restaurant proprietor for his artistic taste, and at the same time a longing to shake the dust of England off his shoes for ever."	1909	1902.0143
"The people now went mad. The barriers were forced, and the huge crowd surged into the dock area, crying out that the Germans had landed and were making for the Custom House. "" A body of seafaring men, on whom the brunt of the work mainly fell, made their way to the vessel, and, as she lay discharging her cargo, boarded her and made for the bridge. The German captain, however, met them, and explained that he was discharging a cargo of iron stone for one of the local ironworks. "" ' We know all about you, ' said one of the dockers, ' we ve heard your yarns before, but we are going to search the ship.' And search the ship they did. A party of over 200 men, armed chiefly with iron bars, accompanied by a constable, went on board and overhauled the entire vessel. They found nothing suspicious, but were met with great courtesy by the seamen, who, as a local docker expressed it, ' seemed to be as big fools as the rest of us.' "" The German Consul here intervened, and issued a placard warning his countrymen that the ship was to be searched, and forbidding them to offer any resistance. It was also stated that the German captain had received a telegram from the Admiralty, warning him that the ship would be searched. "" Shortly after eight o'clock the town was in a state of chaos."	1906	1900.5803

The word Cross (Latin, crux) did not at first have its present technical meaning. It was employed in Classical usage to signify an instrument of torture quite different from that afterwards known as a ""crucifixion cross."" We find it to mean the cangue as used in China, the Spanish garotte and the gibbet. In fact it was simply a word designating any instrument on which an execution was performed. Thus Cicero, in an oration against Verres, says that public images of himself have been put up in Sicily, ""although the people are not even willing to see them at the cross"" (i. e. at their execution) [1]."	1904	1858.5635
Now, while the front of the building is perfectly sharp, the side of the building leading away from us will be less so, and the farther corner will be very much less so, and the window next to the corner will be almost lost in the perspective. Now. we can take advantage of this fact. Suppose we want to isolate a good sized building in a group of smaller buildings, we can do so by placing the camera so that the side of the building leads away from us and by using a long focus lens. The closer the building is to the camera the less the effect will be, and the farther away the more pronounced. On the other hand, if we want a good effect of a small building in a large group, we can do so by placing the camera so that the side of the small building leads away from us and by using a wide angle lens.	1912	1953.5734
The Hippocratic writings are distinguished by clearness of statement, directness of style, and a practical common sense. The so-called Hippocratic oath, which is still in part used by the medical profession, is also one of these writings. The teachings of Hippocrates and his school, while they did not exert any immediate marked influence on medical practice and theory, were not lost. They were preserved in Alexandria, where the medical school of Cnidos and Cos was reestablished, and later on by the Arabian physicians, who were the means of transmitting Greek medical knowledge to the Middle Ages. Galen, the most voluminous writer and greatest physician of antiquity, was profoundly influenced by Hippocrates. He was born in Pergamos in 131 A.D. and died in 201. He was educated in Alexandria and later practised in Pergamos and Rome, where he enjoyed great fame and influence. Galen based his theories on the teachings of Hippocrates and Aristotle, and on his own extensive dissections and observations of the animals and man. He contributed much to anatomy, physiology and pathology, and his observations on the circulation of the blood, the functions of the brain, etc., while not entirely correct, were far in advance of his time. Galen's works were preserved in the Middle Ages and were the main reliance of the physicians of that period.	1911	1865.4681

Jim Weld was not a hard case, except when the devil was up in him, and that was seldom. He was weakly, and he was a fool; but he had a heart, and there was a woman who loved him. He went away from her, and, living in a squalid lodging in the town, he rotted, day by day, becoming more and more a poor little figure of a man, until, at last, he reached that state decreed by the law of the land which is the end of all human failure. This is not a story of how a woman waited for a man, and how he came to her at last. She waited for him; but when he came she was not there. In this world there is a lot of getting in and getting out, and we are all confused by it. Jim Weld came out of the town, a horrible little figure of a man, a little diseased thing, half crippled, with one eye gone and the other lazy, dawdling about, and yet with that dawdling air of resolution which sometimes comes upon a man who knows that the end must be reached. He did not know where he was going, but he went on and on, till at last he found himself on the hill, with the town beneath him, and the grey sea away in the west.	1913	1882.3573
The people were not slow to make the same remarks on the incapacity of the Ministry, and the blindness of the naval authorities, which had been made by the naval officers themselves on the previous evening. It was known that the Admiralty had lost all control over the movements of the fleet, and that the wireless telegraph station at Scapa Flow was in the hands of the enemy. The first rumour that the German fleet had been sighted off the Tyne was scouted as an absurd invention, but it was soon found to be true, and it was added that two cruisers had been sunk in an engagement with the Tyne Defenders, and that the rest had been driven off. This was soon followed by the news that the German fleet had passed the Forth, and were lying in the roads off Granton. At that time it was not known that the German fleet had been sighted off the Orkneys, and had then turned south, and were supposed to have come through the Channel. The first intelligence that reached us concerning the bombardment of the Tyne was to the effect that two German cruisers had been sunk by the Tyne Defenders, and that the rest had been driven off. This was soon followed by the news that the German fleet had passed the Forth, and were lying in the roads off Granton.	1906	1881.4733
"I would have questioned him, but at that moment his foot slipped on the edge of the pavement, and he would have fallen had I not caught him.

The man was certainly blind, and yet he spoke as if he were not. "" I knew you were a fool by your face, "" he resumed, as we walked on side by side. "" I should have known it by that clumsy way you had of catching me."	1911	1895.5187
"Some forty members were present, and a number of papers were read. Professor W. D. Coolidge, of Dalton Technical School, read a paper on ""The Sensations of Light and Colour."" Among other speakers were Dr. A. H. Elliott, Mr. G. W. Dunnington, Mr. P. S. Millar, and Mr. L. B. Marks. A most interesting and instructive discussion followed, and the proceedings were an excellent preparation for the Annual Meeting at Buffalo where a special session was devoted to the subject. Buffalo was reached on August 4th, and I had the honour of being the guest of Mr. S. L. Hagman, the President of the American Society. The members of the Illuminating Engineering Society were most fortunate in being thus able to meet with the warmest possible welcome the President of the National Exhibition gave us in the person of Mr. John C. Campbell, whose brother, Professor Campbell, is well known in this country. In the President's address he emphasised the importance the Exhibition Committee attached to the co operation of the Illuminating Engineering Society, and afterwards, when the American Commission was formed to conduct the work of co operation with the Exhibition Committee, the Commission placed the Society in the position of being the chief technical adviser. The Commission was composed of the following gentlemen : — Mr. John C. Campbell (President of the Exhibition) Chairman."	1912	1876.8542
To consider the question of manuring intelligently we must first consider the composition of the tree and the soil. The tree is composed of the same elements that compose the soil. The soil is the source of practically all of the food elements that the tree uses. It is therefore necessary to know the composition of the soil in order to know what elements should be supplied by the manure. Our fruit trees are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which are obtained from the air and water, and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sulphur, iron, magnesium, and chlorine, which are obtained from the soil. The first three elements are used by the tree in larger quantities than all the others combined. Since they are obtained from the air and water they are not supplied by manuring the land.	1914	1938.0332
- In some cases, the engineer and the contractor are liable jointly and severally. Thus, where the engineer was the agent of the city, having authority to contract for the construction of sewers and drains, and to fix the terms of such contracts, it was held that he and his co-defendant (the contractor) were jointly and severally liable, and that the plaintiff might sue either or both 241. Distinction between Joint and Joint and Several Liability. An action against two or more defendants who are jointly liable may be maintained against either or all of them. The plaintiff may proceed against all, or he may proceed against one, and, after obtaining judgment, may discontinue the action as to the others, and bring a new action against them 242.	1913	1908.076
"Manalive"" has scenes rather than characters. These scenes, which are largely comic, tell how an apparently lunatic young man is arrested for robbery. He maintains that he is not only innocent, but a rich and married man. His marvellous energy in preserving the reality of his actual lunatic life, and the extraordinary luck which he seems to have always, convince two of the detectives of the truth of his story. In the end he escapes, and the inspector, who has fixed his lunacy, is saved from being strangled only by the arrival of a man who proves to be the lunatic's wife. At that the story ends. Most modern readers, I fear, will find the ending weak. ^ The Man Who Would Be King (p. 162) is one of the tales which Kipling added to the 1900 edition of The Seven Seas. It is told in the first person, by an ex-Sapper, who has met two men, Peachey Carnehan and Daniel Dravot. They had served together, and then set out to find their fortunes, and for a time drifted into the wilds of Afghanistan. There they became kings, with Carnehan as Queen's Adviser and Dravot as President of the Council, or such like."	1911	1916.9452

No actor before him had had the courage to be so dignified and quiet."" 2 He had, however, no desire to imitate their manner of playing, and, indeed, sometimes to his own injury; for he declared that he would have his own way, regardless of consequences.

The Reichert Meissl number is of special importance in the examination of butter and margarine. It is a well known fact that butter contains volatile fatty acids in larger amount than do any of the other fats in the animal or vegetable kingdom, and that these acids are in larger proportion than in any of the other fats in the animal kingdom which are of importance in the diet. The volatile fatty acids are butyric, caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric and myristic. Of these only butyric acid occurs in any considerable amount in butter, the other acids being present in very small quantities. The Reichert Meissl number is a measure of the amount of volatile fatty acids present in the fat, and since butter is the only fat of any importance in the diet which contains these acids in considerable amount, the number serves as a good means of distinguishing butter from the various kinds of adulterating fats and oils. But it is only a rough means of determining the purity of butter, for there are a number of fats and oils which contain these acids in some amount and which are therefore capable of being used as adulterants of butter. Among these are lard oil, palm oil, cotton seed oil, whale oil and fish oils.	1913	1946.7385
"concerning the particular subject of tabulated exposures, allow me to put before you the views of a very experienced worker on the subject of tables. This is what he says, and I quote, ""There is one great fault to be found with exposure tables, and that is, their uncertainties and the effect upon the tyro or inexperienced worker, who, finding a given exposure unequal to the occasion, concludes that paper or emulsion or collodion are bad, and so goes on trying experiment after experiment on bad or non sensitive material, when the fault lies entirely with himself. For example, I may take the average table as giving about four times the exposure that is necessary with good gelatine plates. Now, a worker who has grasped the subject well and knows the responding qualities of his emulsion, if he see the plate under exposed, would say to himself, 'Well, it was not over exposed, and therefore I will try one quarter of the stated exposure next time,' but he does not, he immediately jumps to the conclusion, dubious and faulty, that the emulsion is bad. Now I have seen some of our best workers ruined for months, and that by one bad exposure table. Mr. Swain, in his notes made on the subject of tables, says: 'I have found a good deal of difference between the exposure given in these tables and those required for really sensitive plates, and I am generally inclined to trust more to the result of actual experience than to the tables.'"" Now, I think the same might be said of metres, and it certainly is true of both metres and tables that they are too often compiled from second hand knowledge of the experiments made by others."	1912	1876.6888
Page 26 When the signatures are firmly held between the boards, a needle, with a convenient length of strong linen thread (one twice the length of the back is a fair measure), is inserted through the forced aperture, passed through the substance of the back of one signature, coming out about ^ inch from the edge, then through the back of the next signature, again coming out at the same distance from the edge, and so on till all are passed through. The needle is then brought out through the first signature, but only through the grooves made by the needle. When it has been carefully pulled through, a SHAPE OF THREADING THREADING IS IN THE SHAPE OF A FIGURE 8. End of the thread is tied to the exposed end of the other half and the two threads pulled tight (not until then).	1912	1867.6598
"XIII. For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the American Federation of Arts and their work, we give the following abstract of their constitution : — ""The American Federation of Arts was organised in 1904 to advance the knowledge, taste and practice of the arts in the United States. Its objects are accomplished by means of exhibitions of paintings, sculpture, photographs, works in ornamental and industrial art, and architectural drawings ; by the publication of catalogues and manuals ; by lectures and discussions ; by the formation of local associations, and by the promotion of art museums. ""The Federation is composed of national and local associations of artists, architects, art and music critics, art museums, art schools and art dealers. The national associations are : The American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Design, the American Water Colour Society, the American Society of Portrait Painters, the American Society of Miniature Painters, the American Society of Decorative Painters, the Society of American Artists, the Architectural League of New York, the Boston Society of Sculptors, the American Society of Wood Engravers, the Society of American Graphic Artists, the American Federation of Technical Society and Engineers, the Photographic Society of America, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, the American Society of Arts and Crafts, the American Craftsman Guild, and the Guild of Arts and Crafts, Boston. ""The local associations are composed of artists and amateur art workers in towns and cities throughout the United States."	1912	1922.8934
The distance apart of the tangential ordinates of the deflection curve, ie. the abscissae of the areas of Fig. 122. the bending moment diagram, may be made longer than the escape between the ordinates oi the . - Fig. 123. . , - i T ' tangent and normal polygons; indeed, the tangential ordinates may be placed any distance apart and yet the shape of the curve be correct, but for drawing purposes they should not be less than three times their distance apart on the beam. A true deflection curve, as thus constructed, is a very good check on a second approximate method of estimating the vertical deflection of a beam, which is made by finding the vertical component of the shear at the centre of gravity of each part of the bending moment diagram, and multiplying the shear thus found by the distance from the centroid of the part to the point at which the deflection is desired.	1908	1900.7274
"""Seek and ye shall find"" is the only method that educates and develops. ""It is only by requiring the learner to think for himself that the teacher fulfils his highest function. The pupil will find, as a rule, that the only things which he really knows are those which he has discovered for himself."" — John Stuart Mill. 3. Sifting Suggestions. — Suggestion is a function of the second stage of the mental process. After the mind has attended to an object and has apperceived it, the ego again asserts itself. It says: ""This new material is appropriate for me, I will retain it; this is alien to my needs, consequently I will discard it. Thus a third stage is found in the process of knowledge: the stage of rejection or of discrimination. The ego has to decide how the fact shall remain in consciousness and how it shall be allowed to go back into the store of unconsciousness. The function of rejection or of discrimination is, as we see, linked with the will. A fact may strike me as interesting and I may notice it. After the act of noticing I find that the fact has a meaning for me, I can apperceive it; but the final decision whether I shall take it into the storehouse of knowledge depends upon the exercise of my will. ""The first essential of culture, "" says J. S. Mill, ""is that the mind should be stored with a considerable number of facts, many of them apparently unconnected with each other and with any practical purpose."	1909	1955.5247
The result is brought about, and then consciousness steps in and finds the result ready for its consideration. The active mind has been a passive mind, a mind not interfering. If the result is satisfactory, the end is attained and the process is one of realisation. If the result is not satisfactory, then the end is not attained and the process is one of failure. The process of failure is one of the most important processes in our life. It is the process which teaches us the lesson of discrimination. It is the process which shows us that the end before our mind is not the only end and not the right end. The end is one of the most important factors in the process of volition, but it is not the only one, and it is not the most important one. 187  The end is the starting point of the process, but it is not the goal of the process.	1909	1935.6552
It was only in two small areas that the growth of the race was hastened by intercourse with other lands. The Scandinavian settlements on the coast of the eastern side had great im] irtance in the history of the ]'I]gW'1 and We have already mentioned 1 l Advocates of Scandinavian theory of the English t l sameness of blood have been less successful in proving it in the case of Ireland. The settlers were Gaelic tribes so thoroughly that all that remain of these settlements are the names of places. But the Scandinavian settlement on the coast of the western side, where Limerick and Waterford are situated, was very different. In Norway were living the descendants of those Norsemen who A long two centuries before had seized upon the Western Isles.	1908	1896.6036
Specimen C, however, had a slightly tarnished surface, while A and B were untarnished. Specimen D had a much tarnished surface, and the results are very different from those for C, while they are not far from those for the slightly tarnished B. Specimen E is a thin disc with a good surface, and it shows a tensile strength much less than for the other specimens, but a very high ductility. Specimen F is a thin disc of the same thickness as E, and it shows a similar behaviour to that of E. Specimen G is a thin wire drawn down from 0-181 in. diameter, and having a pitted surface. It shows a very high tensile strength, but very low ductility. The values for the elastic limit and tensile strength for the specimens A, B, and C compare very favourably with those for the best commercial brass. The values for the ductility are lower than the best commercial brasses, but they are not very low for so high a strength. Specimens E and F, however, show that a much higher ductility could be obtained if the tensile strength were lowered. Specimen G shows that as the diameter is reduced, the strength increases and the ductility decreases, which is the usual behaviour of metals. The slightly tarnished specimen C showed a lower elastic limit and tensile strength than the untarnished specimens A and B, which is contrary to the behaviour of most metals.	1912	1898.3651
a stress of 2 tonnes per square inch in a specimen of grey cast iron is probably due to the crushing of the graphite. The extent of the elastic limit is very variable, for while in some cast irons it is as much as 10 or 15 tonnes per square inch, in others it is less than one tonne per square inch. The yield point is very clearly marked in most cast irons, and is much lower than in wrought iron or mild steel. The fracture of cast iron is usually brittle, but ductile cast iron is known in which the fracture is ductile. The tensile strength of cast iron is very variable, being from about 10 to 60 tonnes per square inch, and it is greatly influenced by the method of casting, the section, the rate of cooling, and other factors.	1908	1909.0438
11.

Even in such districts it is not enough to have one or two specialists to whom designers of lighting plants can be expected to come when they are in trouble, it should be the rule that before the completion of any lighting scheme it receives the approval of the lighting experts on the staff of the gas undertaking. The facilities for expert assistance in designing plants that may be availed of should be publicly advertised, and it should be expected that they will be used. That the lighting engineer should be well versed in the theory of his art is, of course, taken for granted. He must know the prinoiples that underlie the comparison of light sources; he must be able to deduce from the laws of photometry the various facts upon which the practical side of his lighting scheme depends, and he must have this knowledge so well at command that his attention is not necessarily diverted from the material he is handling to the source from which he obtained it.	1912	1920.4106
Many who are not corruptly subservient are unconsciously so, not so much because of the power that made them judges as because of the power that is always at work in court and at the bar to promote and sustain judicial servility. Court and bar are conspiring to that end. The bar supplies the needs that courts have and the courts supply the needs that the bar has and the power that is always at work in both court and bar to promote and sustain judicial servility is the selfish and sordid spirit of gain. The bar is not a profession of patriotism. It is a business. Most of the lawyers are in the business for what they can get out of it, not for what they can give to it, and so it is that they are as ready, as willing, and as able to conspire to the end of judicial servility as are the courts.	1911	1928.2852
The fault is shown by the offset of the dike. The thickness of the dike is greatest along the line of fault. The pegmatite contains more mica crystals in this thicker portion than in the other parts of the dike. (Photo by L. H. H.) these inclusions are so abundant that the pegmatite is practically a gneiss breccia. A few feet from the pegmatite the inclusions are seen to shade off into more or less disintegrated material in which the original structure can be made out. Further from the contact no traces of the penetration of the pegmatite are visible. In the neighbourhood of the contact the gneiss is altered to a greater or less extent. The feldspar is more or less kaolinized, the pyroxene is changed to hornblende, the quartz is crystallized, and the rock is more or less schistose. The alteration is most pronounced along the border of the pegmatite and gradually lessens until no change is seen in the gneiss a few feet from the contact. The alteration is probably due to hot vapours and solutions given off from the cooling pegmatite. The pegmatites are composed of the same minerals as the gneiss, namely, quartz, feldspar, muscovite, biotite, hornblende, pyroxene, garnet, apatite, tourmaline, and sphene.	1905	1946.7113
Summing moments about O. w p = F l II . . . (10) Walso, the algebraic sum of the forces in the direction of F is zero. Hence, if e is the angle of inclination of the strut to the horizontal, F — w cos e Ifp = w sin e . . .

The bending moment at the fixed end is M = and (14) This is two-third of the moment due to a similar strut freely hinged at both ends. Case V., Fig. 148. — This is the same as the last case, except that the strut is allowed to slide at the hinge. Hence no horizontal force is called into play, and the bending moment at the fixed end is zero. Case VI., Fig. 149. — The strut is fixed at both ends in the same way as for the first case, but the length b is less than a, hence the strut is bowed.	1908	1942.9656
However, the movement of the 50F line will not necessarily be parallel to the wind direction and at the same speed. The wind may be at right angles to the 50F line and thus the movement of the fog may be either north or south, depending on the relative positions of the wind direction and the 50F line. Usually the 50F line moves southward faster than the wind, and the movement of the fog is then also southward. Upon reaching the cold, 40F waters, the 50F line will bend to the west because moisture is being removed from the overwaters air by the cooling effect of the waters. The wind may remain nearly the same, but the fog will then move nearly the same as the 50F line, that is, nearly east.	1913	1942.3915

Such conditions could not exist in the long run, and they did not. The reaction towards law and order was strengthened, and the reforming zeal which had been inspired by Howard speedily made its presence felt in the prisons. As we shall see in the next chapter, it did not benefit the lives of the prisoners, for in those early days the prison authorities were not fit persons to administer reforming zeal. But as far as the punishment was concerned, it led to great changes. In 1792 Sir Samuel Romilly introduced the first of his series of measures for abolishing capital punishment for certain offences. He had not at first any intention of attacking the system of transportation, which had originated in a Bill passed in 1717. This Bill had been introduced as an alternative to the gallows, and had provided that every convict under sentence of transportation should be sent to one of the colonies. In 1787 Pitt was able to carry an amendment to this Act, which made it compulsory on the Government to send every prisoner to be transported to New South Wales, the first  Penal Colony. Romilly's first ideas were to restrict the death penalty to burglary at night and the stealing of sheep. He was met with the argument that this was an inducement to commit burglary in the daytime. He then made a further concession, and restricted the penalty to burglary committed in the company of three or more persons.	1908	1891.8273
The two ends of this tube are bent at right angles, and pass inside the plate and project into the bell jar, the ends of the two bent tubes being about one inch apart. The tube can be heated by means of a Bunsen or other gas lamp, and by dripping water on to the outer ends of the tubes the temperature may be kept down to 85-90° C. The pressure is most easily reduced by means of a water pump, and it is advisable to make the joint between the metal plate and the bell jar of wax, as it is then easily renewed if it leaks. An apparatus of this kind has been in use in the laboratory for several years and has given complete satisfaction. 2.	1913	1892.8145

The Great God Money. PELLEW HAWKER A tale of the stock exchange and of love and hate, revenge and forgiveness. An honest young broker is forced to the wall by the machinations of a dishonest and unscrupulous money lender. The young broker's sweetheart, who is the daughter of a peer, is won over by the money lender's wiles. The young broker goes to Canada, where he meets the money lender, who is masquerading under an assumed name. In a moment of danger the money lender shows his true character, and the young broker, who is a man of honour, refuses to take advantage of the knowledge that is within his grasp and lets the money lender go free. The young broker returns to England, where he is met and embraced by his first love. The Devil's Own.

"I expostulated with him and pointed out that the road to the west was blocked by the burning lorries, and that the only course open to me was to press on to the east, where, I was confident, I would find a means of crossing the river. He remained obdurate, and I was obliged to retrace my steps. "" I now made for the eastern end of the town, and ran along the bank of the river, but when I reached the bridge over the canal which runs parallel to the river, I found the Germans had already set fire to the wooden structure, and were preparing to blow up the stone arch. I was now in a serious predicament. The road east was blocked by the burning lorries, and the bridge over the river was guarded by a detachment of Uhlans, who, I was certain, would allow no one to cross. I was, however, determined to make the attempt, and so ran on to the bridge. I was right in my surmise. The Germans were guarding it, and as I reached the centre of the arch they called on me to halt. I was not going to stop, and so, putting on a spurt, dashed past them, and was across the bridge before they had recovered from their surprise sufficiently to attempt to stop me. I was now in the immediate vicinity of the German position."	1906	1880.9799

Theorem (3). — The moment of inertia of a plane figure about an axis perpendicular to its plane through a point O is equal to the moment of inertia of the figure about an axis through the centroid C parallel to the given axis, plus the product of the mass of the figure by the square of the distance between the two axes. Or, if A is the area of the figure and d the distance between the two axes, then — I = Ic + Ad2 This theorem is of great practical importance, since the moment of inertia about the axis through the centroid is often easily found, and the distance d is usually easily measured. Theorem (4). — The moment of inertia of a plane figure about a given axis is equal to the moment of inertia of the figure about a parallel axis through the centroid, plus the product of the mass of the figure by the square of the distance between the two axes. Or, if C is the centroid and d the distance between the two axes, then — I = Ic + Ad2 This theorem is of the same form as the preceding, and is easily proved by the same reasoning.	1908	1962.7482
They would be forced to study the laws of gravity and motion in order to be able to calculate the most economical course to pursue in the construction of their waterways. They would also be forced to learn a very great deal about the nature of the soil over which their canals must be built. They would have to learn whether it would absorb or retain water, and, if it would absorb it, to what extent. They would have to learn how to construct their banks and the nature of the material of which they were to be built. In other words, they would be forced to study the laws of chemistry and geology in order to be able to build a waterway which would serve the purpose intended. When the water reached its destination they would have to learn how to use it to the best advantage, and the study of this subject would lead them to the study of the laws of chemistry.	1911	1952.858
An ion, then, is an atom that has lost or gained an electron. Ions are produced in great numbers in the atmosphere by the action of sunlight and of radioactive substances. In the air we breathe there are millions of ions in every cubic inch, and these ions are continually moving about, and, like the dust, they will condense vapour into liquid. The presence of these ions in the air is easily tested. If a glass tube be sealed at one end, and a little air be exhausted from it, a small piece of radium may be placed in the tube, and the amount of light emitted by the radium will be found to be considerably increased. This is due to the ions emitted by the radium. When a little water is sprinkled on the floor of a room, and a glass vessel is placed over it, the water will be found to be condensed on the inside of the glass in the form of drops. If the glass is now removed, and a piece of radium is placed in the vessel, the air inside the vessel will be ionised, and the vapour will be condensed in the form of a thin film on the sides of the vessel. If the glass is now placed over the water again, the film will be found to have disappeared. In this way we can prove that the ions condense vapour, and it is quite possible that the water which collects on the dust in the street is due to the ions which are present in the atmosphere.	1913	1922.291
"Other names have been applied to some of the substances belonging to this class, that are prepared from different sources, but no special name has been used to designate all of them. Thus, according to Thudichum and others, there are "" cerebrin "" or "" myelin cerebrin, "" * "" leucosin, "" ""* "" neuron "" or "" phosphor cerebrin, "" "" beef gall phosphatide, "" "" yolk phosphatide, "" "" egg phosphatide, "" "" brain phosphatide, "" "" testicle phosphatide, "" and "" spleen phosphatide "" respectively. Most of these names may be eliminated from consideration for the following reasons: Cerebrin is a mixture of a higher alcohol, higher fatty acids, and an amido body. Neuron is believed to be an alcohol and not a compound of an alcohol. Thudichum's leucosin was shown by him as long ago as 1898 to be identical with yolk lipin. Spleen lipin is identical with yolk lipin and has therefore nothing special about it. Brain lipin is identical with myelin lipin. Each of the substances called phosphatide has been prepared, in the strictest sense of the word, by hydrolysis and isolation of the so-called acid phosphoester radical from ether soluble extracts of different organs, and the substances have been shown to contain glycerol, amido bodies, fatty acids, and different amounts of phosphorus, part or all of which radicaIs are introduced when the lipins are made from their constituents by boiling with acids."	1913	1958.1976
"The Dionysiac intoxication which he preached in ""The Birth of Tragedy"" was for himself a temporary escape from the paralysis of will to which he had finally to give in. Asceticism, in one form or another, and in spite of the abandonment of ascetic ideals, is the characteristic of modern life. It is the habit of self denying which has replaced the old time habit of open and joyous living. Self denial, even of the form which Professor William James characterises as ""the effort to keep our dreams and opinions in harmony with the working of the material world, "" — even this form of self denial is no longer so demanding as it was in earlier days. We deny our own opinions, for example, with considerable gaiety, provided only we do not have to act on them. Professor James refers to this deficiency as ""the dreamy quality of our age."" We are filled with beautiful dreams, which evaporate like those of every other age as soon as the waking hour strikes. The dreams are not heroic enough to be the stuff out of which heroism is made. We have the Wagnerian ""sick nerves, "" as Nietzsche pointed out; but the ""Dionysiac intoxication"" which we crave takes the form of exaggerated emotion as expressed in our literature and art, rather than the Dionysiac creation of the artist himself."	1913	1901.2457

The first effort was to rent a small room in a private house, which was done for the trifling sum of a hundred marks a year. The bank now had an office in which to meet regularly, and to keep its books and its cash. A bank safe was bought for two hundred marks, and the balance was spent for a few stationery articles, which, with the room, are the only expenses the bank has ever had. In this small room, with its few pieces of furniture, the bank has ever since held its meetings. The next step was to open a checking account with the nearest regular bank, which was done, although that nearby regular bank was the largest in the entire province, and for its size the most important in Germany.	1913	1895.2987
Pyroxene and Biotite. — In the deposits where the pyroxene is well developed, the biotite is usually found in small flakes, which are irregularly scattered through the pegmatite. The biotite is seldom developed in sheets and when so developed, the sheets are usually cut by the mica vein. In the Red Mountain Mine in Wakefield, the biotite occurs in large sheets, which are cut by the mica vein. The pyroxene and biotite are seldom found in the same deposit. In most of the deposits pyroxene is present and in a few biotite is developed. In the deposits with pyroxene, the biotite is usually absent, and in those with biotite, the pyroxene is absent. In some deposits, both minerals are present, but one or the other is poorly developed. In the Red Mountain Mine, Wakefield, both are well developed; in the Mountain Mine, Wakefield, both are poorly developed; in the King Mine, Hull, and in the King Mine, Templeton, the pyroxene is well developed and the biotite is poorly developed. In the Mountain Mine, Ottawa, the biotite is well developed and the pyroxene is poorly developed. The occurrence of one or the other of these two minerals in the deposits is probably due to the difference in the chemical composition of the pegmatite.	1905	1923.8451
Personally, he had always thought greens the most difficult colours to photograph, and very little difference was seen between the No. 1 and No. 2 Wratten plates. Blue, on the other hand, was very well represented, and even S. R. 1 and S. R. 2 stood out clearly. Personally, he liked the R. 1 and R. 2 filters, because they were so cheap. Dr. E. E. Burch added that he would have expected the Wratten No. 1 plate, in conjunction iwitli the Wratten K 2 filter, to have given a greater amount of ultra violet light; but this was perhaps explained by the fact that it was very seldom that Wratten filters were up to the mark. Mr. Ritchie replied that in his experience Wratten filters were as good as any others he tried, his greatest disappoint ment being with the Schott filters. He was very glad that Dr. Burch had mentioned the K 2 filter, for he felt rather afraid that he was perhaps unduly praising this to some of the audience. He was particularly glad to learn that Dr. Burch had found it good. Regarding the point raised by Dr. E. E. Burch as to the discrepancy in the amount of ultraviolet light transmitted by the No. 1 and the No. 2 plates and the K 2 filter, it would be remembered that he (Mr. Ritchie) had mentioned the fact that he had not been able to test these plates himself. He had always found the Wratten K 2 filter very good; where it stood out very well was in the ifine definition it gave in blue objects; for instance, in a blue sky one would get very sharp edges.	1912	1925.8444
And the Lord thy God hath sent me to tell thee that the wood whereof the Lord Christ shall be crucified hath been hidden from the creation of the world, and that it is in the land of Judea, and in a mountain of that land, and in a garden of that mountain; and that Adam thy father took thence a twig, and planted it in the ground in the centre of Paradise, and that it grew into a great tree. And when Adam was cast out of Paradise, the Lord God commanded the angels to take that tree from the centre of Paradise, and to plant it in the earth, and to guard it till the coming of Christ, that they might know the tree of which the Creator had made man.	1904	1882.3687
All that will be necessary will be to consider the mode of entering into contracts by the construction company. It is in the invitation to bid and in the bid itself that the formalities and requirements which are the subject of this chapter are found. The mode of entering into a construction contract is by bidding upon the part of the contractor, and the acceptance of the bid by the owner, if the bidding is done in accordance with the requirements of the owner. In a general sense the invitation to bid and the bid are the two necessary elements of a construction contract, but in many instances the form of bid and the invitation to bid are not the only elements necessary. The invitation to bid often contains a statement of the terms upon which the owner will receive bids, and the form of bid which is to be used by the contractor in making his offer.	1913	1893.9279
The labourers in the glass factories at that time were paid by the piece, and the average wage was from $1.60 to $2.00 a day. The Co operative Glass Company, however, disregarding this custom, agreed to pay each workman $2.50 a day, whether he produced much or little. The company also agreed to continue this wage for a period of three years, provided the workmen would agree to remain with the company for that length of time. The men were working for their own interests, and, of course, they were satisfied with the arrangement. The company was also fortunate in securing a skilled foreman, who had formerly been in the employ of the American Glass Company. This man was a native of Belgium, and had been one of the workmen in the glass factory at Charleroi. When the factory began operations, the first day, the workmen received their pay at the rate of $2.50 a day, though some of them were not able to produce as high a grade of glass as they had formerly done, when their	1911	1903.0621
The first step is to realise that we are closely related to him. The majority of people in the world have some excuse for their criminality. The well-to-do classes are not so well off as they think. But we must not go into this side at present. It is the poor, the under fed, the under clothed, the under housed, and the under educated, who form the great army of criminals. Now, we are all connected with the poor. We are all, in some way, responsible for their housing, their food, and their education. We are all, to a certain extent, members of the great modern system of Mammon worship, which is the cause of the deplorable conditions under which the majority of our population exists. The problem of unemployment is largely due to the exploitation of labour. The worker is forced to take any job at any wage, or else starve.

(After Riley.) 28 THE APPLE AND ITS ENEMIES. nests common on apple and other trees in spring. The eggs are deposited in a band of white material, which is the case, and when the caterpillars hatch they all proceed to eat from this band outward and to enlarge the tent or nest. The feeding is continued in the shelter of the tent, which is enlarged from time to time, and in this way the trees are not much injured. The full grown caterpillar is about 2 inches long, of a bluish white colour, with black spots and a reddish orange stripe along each side. It is therefore easy to distinguish them from the fall webworm (Fig. 28, 6), which has no orange stripe and is greenish instead of bluish.	1914	1894.0753

The association are ready to send out an agent to assist the farmers in drawing up their application, and to give them any assistance required. Some little delay has occurred in the completion of arrangements for sending out the agent, owing to the fact that Mr. Williamson, who was to have gone out, met with an accident which prevented him for the present from doing so.	1908	1877.1875

His life was spent in the service of learning, and he was the most influential figure in the revival of learning under Charlemagne. He died in 804. His letters are a valuable source of information about the intellectual life of the time. The earliest reference to the Anglo-Saxons occurs in a letter written to Ethelred of Northumberland in 792. A letter written to Ethelbald, king of Mercia, in 798, calls him ' a most dear son of the English people, ' and urges him to build schools and provide masters for them.2 The most important letter is one addressed to Ethelbold, king of Mercia, in 798. This letter urges the king to provide teachers for his people. ' If you desire, ' says Alcuin, ' that the sons of the nobility of your kingdom should be educated in the schools of Gaul, you will not find teachers who will come to you willingly, for they fear that they will not be able to return to their own country. But if you wish to have masters and scholars, we are ready to come to you.' Alcuin offers to send masters skilled in singing, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and law, to teach the children of the king and of the nobility, and adds that for the labour of the masters the king must provide a sustenance such as he would give to God.3 Alcuin had in his mind the educational work he had carried on in the school at York, and he longed to see such schools established in England.	1904	1891.7689

In the southern colonies, where the use of indentured servants was more common than in the north, they were frequently of respectable position; craftsmen and mechanics who had fallen into poverty, or young men and women just starting in life, who bound themselves for a few years in order to learn a trade or to gain capital. They were, as a rule, well treated, and it was not uncommon for a master to lend a servant money to start in business at the end of his indenture. In the north, on the other hand, the servants were usually of a lower class. They were largely recruited from the jails and workhouses of England and were almost always ill treated. In many colonies the law required that new comers should be sold into service, and the vendue at which they were sold was an occasion of public merriment.	1913	1893.0582

"Many of the great stores are run on the lines of commission agency and wholesale trading combined. Practically the store itself becomes a large commission merchant, with a multitude of little shops under its roof, each one dealing with a particular manufacturer of some special article, and so each department becomes in effect a central small agency. The following extract from an article in "" The Review of Reviews, "" for October, 1905, is worthy of quotation: — "" The steady ascendancy of the department store, a development of retail trade which has been almost unknown here in England, has made the duty of the small shopkeeper more difficult than it ever was before. The department store is the outcome of the modern spirit of organisation in business. It collects under one roof every variety of stock that the urban consumer requires and it appeals to every class of buyer. It serves the well-to-do, its methods are so elastic that it serves the poor and the middle class even better. It can underbid its rivals; it can afford to sell at a low margin of profit. Dispersed tradesmen and small shopkeepers cannot compete with it. The department store is the strongest example of co-operative distribution; nowhere else has industrial life been so thoroughly organised. Ever since the opening of the first great department store in New York, A. T. Stewart's in Broadway, the evolution of retail life in the United States has kept pace with the evolution of wholesale life. "" The system of department stores has spread and developed until in 1904 there were no fewer than 2,700 of these institutions in the United States."	1907	1900.3485
And such feelings cannot be quiet in the heart, for they are the voice of the moral law; and the greater our powers, the nobler our opportunities, the clearer our knowledge, the more certain is the condemnation of sins of omission and commission. If, then, repentance is seen to grow as the judgement of regret and the judgement of condemnation mature, the importance of these two elements in the experience becomes at once evident. Indeed, it is their presence which turns the transient mood of regret into the abiding attitude of penitence. For the real spirit of penitence is the spirit of the protest against evil in ourselves. It is the spirit of that inner revolution which is the basis of a true morality and a true religion. It is the fixing of the heart in the determination to follow the impulse of its highest moments.	1908	1875.005
"The perfect woman must possess all three qualities, and Mrs. McCaffrey is such. That she is a true woman, a good wife, attested by her behaviour in the affair of Mr. McCaffrey, which was so nobly concealed by the late Mrs. Jones — known to us as the "" angel, "" who lodged in the same house — that goodness as a mother is shown by her affection for and her pride in her son; and lastly, that she is "" intellectual "" is proved by her calm argument with Mr. Wells on the subject of birth control, and by her appreciation of Mr. Wells's literature, then new, and not, as now, "" part of the curriculum."" By the way, the term "" birth control "" was coined by Mrs. Wells, and it is a pity that Mr. Wells has never had the courage to acknowledge the fact. But the powers of Mrs. Wells are not confined to the household arts: she is as great a pioneer as her husband. "" I'm going to tell you the story of my life, "" she said, in a letter to a friend, "" and it's a queer one"" — and she kept her word. Indeed, the Wells memoirs were at first intended for her eyes only. But she had to give her consent, for her husband is, even now, a little afraid of the English libel laws, and she finally agreed — "" because, "" she said, "" you have written nothing that I should mind a friend of my son's reading."	1911	1883.2632

"In this mood Paul was reminded of Cleopatra or Messaline, when a goddess, in the full splendour of the noon hour, with nothing but sunshine to beckon to her. Dmitry stood gazing up at the two from the steps. He had grown very thin. His crumpled blue broadcloth evening suit hung away from him. He was not strong, nor was his heart, nor his mind as yet. He was keeping up under his load of trouble and tragedy, and inducing transient forgetfulness through sheer force of this will, and by appealing to the will of others. He looked like a man who had gone through much, like the wreck of one of the forlorn hopes of Bradshaw's ""aeries."" It woke pity in Paul, who, but for the fatal fiend which entered into his spirit like a drug that night at the ""Vienna, "" would have left Helena, and run down the moonlit steps, taking Dmitry in his arms, and bringing him into the circle of light."	1909	1887.9532
The motor reaction is the first and the last element in the whole mental process. It is the first element because the other elements of the mental process — the sensations, ideas, feelings — have their origin in the motor responses. We have seen that the motor impulse is the first impulse given to the nervous system. It is the first stimulus which 136 reaches the higher centres, because it has to be elaborated in lower centres, and it is always the first element which is elaborated in the higher centres, and it is the last element which is elaborated in the higher centres, because it is the last element which is elaborated in the lower centres. It is the last element because every mental process ends in some motor discharge.	1909	1962.7306
In a large room or out of doors, always use at least three times as much powder as in a small room. A good rule to follow is to use about one grain of powder for each square inch of surface of the lens. Thus, if the front of the lens is six inches in diameter, it has a surface of about 28 square inches, and will require about 28 grains of powder, or about one level teaspoonful. This amount is more than is needed in a small room, but is just about right for an average view out of doors. In case of doubt, use more powder rather than less, as a little excess is better than a deficiency. The powder should be poured into the large end of the funnel or cone until it is full, and after the exposure is made, the photographer should be careful to see that it is all emptied out of the camera, as if any powder is left in it may spoil future exposures by going off at the wrong time, or by being ignited by the flame of the magnesium ribbon.	1912	1904.8667
The sun was low when we reached the city. The driver took us into the Plaza de San Francisco, where the most interesting building is the old tobacco factory, a huge square structure, with high walls and barred windows, and a clock tower. It was here that Carmen worked, and in the great square below, in front of the hotel where we spent our last night, Don Jose met her, and, after some fencing, forced her to go away with him. The clock tower was not there in those days, but the building must have changed little. The Plaza de San Francisco is an attractive spot, with its fountain, its palms, its shade trees, and its little tables, and it is the favourite gathering place for the Sevilleans.	1913	1924.5491
""" It was his fault, "" he said, ""and he was really very tempting and elusive. I am so sorry."" Then she looked up. ""Oh! "" she said quietly. ""You thought I was drowning? Thank you. I was just learning to swim and had to yell to attract attention. I — I am very much obliged."" And Peter, speechless, turned and fled toward the camp, while Culprit pursued him that he might delve among the fragments of lunch. He was still pursuing when they met the doctor. ""Andy, "" said Peter hollowly, ""I am engaged to a girl. I never want to speak to her again. Tell the old gentleman I am dead, will you, and — and — "" ""Engaged to a girl, "" repeated the doctor, ""and so soon after your mother's death! What does she say?"" ""I never — never — never want to see her again, "" moaned Peter. ""Put that in the catechism and read it to me."" The doctor turned. ""My dear young friend, "" he said gently. ""I have no doubt there is some simple explanation. Would you — "" ""She was bathing with a man, "" snapped Peter. ""That is simple enough. I shall explain to you later."""	1913	1946.7374
"—W. H. H. ""In New Zealand, where there are no public lands, the railroads are owned by the government, and the government owns no land except that on which the railroads are built."" —W. H. H. ""The opinion that the government ownership of railroads has proved a failure in New Zealand is supported by the testimony of the best authorities. The railroads are owned and operated by the government, and the report of the Controller and Auditor General of New Zealand for 1906 shows that the railroads on the 31st day of March of that year were in debt to the government in the sum of £8,563,000, and that the interest on this sum, amounting to £355,000, was being met by an annual grant from the Consolidated Fund of £350,000, which represented the entire surplus revenue of the colony, leaving the railroads to be operated on a deficit of £5,000 annually."	1911	1898.1876
The force of gravity at the surface of the Sun is therefore 332,000 (109-4)3 times that at the surface of the Earth. But (109-4)3 is i, ioo,ooo,ooo, so that the force of gravity at the surface of the Sun is no more than one third (actually one third and a fraction) of that at the surface of the Earth. This can easily be verified. On the Earth the force of gravity is measured by the weight of I kilogramme mass. Hence, at the Sun's surface, I kilogramme mass would weigh only 0-33 kilogramme, or, as we say, would have a weight of only 0-33 gramme. The force of gravity at the surface of a body is called the gravity of that body; and what we have just calculated enables us to compare the gravity of the Earth with that of the Sun. Thus, 9-81 i.e. 0-33 where g is the gravity of the Earth, and G that of the Sun. Consequently 3 G = — grams. It may be well to remind the reader here that we have been omitting the decimals in our calculations for the sake of brevity, and shall continue to do so whenever it does not introduce ambiguity. Having found the bulk of the Sun and calculated its weight from the density, we are now able to estimate its importance in comparison with the other large bodies in the Solar System. Having scaled the Solar System down to the dimensions of the model at Fig. 30, let us represent the Sun by a sphere (not a cube) whose diameter shall be a little over 12 inches (30 cm.).	1913	1950.1923
The burden of proving that deductions are allowable in a transfer rests on the vendor. Encouraged by these liberal provisions, owners of improved land in Porto Rico are inclined to let their property remain in their name notwithstanding that other persons enjoy the profits. Such arrangements are made for the advantage of evading taxation, not necessarily for reasons of advantage to the property, for which many of them are not consistent. As soon as the United States took charge of Porto Rico an effort was initiated to improve the method of tax collection. As the system stands to day, however, it is very unsatisfactory. The law itself is the worst feature, and there is no prospect of its repeal. The method of collection and assessment might be improved to some extent It is the common practice for a man to go before the council and say that he owns such and such a piece ofland and has covered it with buildings of so much apparent value.	1911	1908.2684
Troops, field artillery, machine guns, a few aeroplanes and transport wagons, horses, and motorcycles, all arrived in orderly succession, and before dawn the only visible remnants on the beach were an overturned boat and a pile of loot — a broken down motor car, covered with sand, surrounded by a few stranded bicycles. So far as the eye could see, however, out towards the roads, all was dark and quiet, but the loud clang of the bell upon the church of St. Mary, Looms Lane, near by, warned the inhabitants of the approach of the Huns and the danger that threatened them. The bell commenced tolling about 3.30 a.m., and continued its tolling for fully one hour, until the church steeple was surrounded by German soldiers, who fired into the belfry and put a violent end to the action of the bell.	1906	1956.2946
"""Have you ever thought that the money you are now using is not your own? You have received it as a loan from some one else, and you must repay it. You are thus bound to use it wisely, or you are robbing those who are depending on you to use well what has been entrusted to you. You cannot buy an automobile, a piano, or a suit of clothes, without incurring a debt which you must pay. That money which you so freely spend for luxuries, you do not own. It is a part of the capital of your father. You are robbing the home of comforts, of many things it needs, of your own future, in thus using money that belongs to others. Are you willing to do this? ""You are now on the verge of manhood. You cannot long live the life of a boy. Are you ready to assume the responsibilities of a man? Until you do you have no right to the privileges of manhood. You cannot buy a gun, go fishing, or do any of the things which are the proper pursuits of manhood."" To the boy will come appeals from home. ""We are short of money. Buy us this. Bring us that. Will you borrow for us? We cannot get on. We must have a little help.""

The system's expense is met by small fees from both employers and employees. In return for a small sum, an employer is guaranteed a certain percentage of satisfactory applicants. In the majority of cases the associations do not work for profit. The margins allowed do not cover the expense of maintenance. Often they run in debt, and in such cases rely upon the generosity of the mOre prosperous associations for financial aid. On a representative scale, the operation of this association may be portrayed. Three hundred employers pay a small annual fee and are enrolled. Two hundred fifty-three men are sent them during the year. One hundred thirty-seven are taken on and twenty-seven retained for ninety days. In many localities there are apprentice bureaus, frequently manned by girls, which have been established with the co-operation of trades unions. It has been found that gradually building up a body of competent workmen, many of whom have learned their trades there, helps to stabilise union shops. This explains the reason why trade unions are so liberally represented in these associations. The common idea that the unions stand for an unscientific, selfish, and mediative attitude towards labour is quite erroneous. They simply embody the best scientific outgrowth of trades connection. They are slow to abandon their conservative opposition in industries where overwork and industrial slaughter prevail.	1913	1916.2449
"Basil turned to Herr Vollmer. ""I shall not forget this kindness, Herr Vollmer, "" he said warmly. The Herr shook his head. ""No, no, it is nothing at all. I should have done it for anybody."" ""But I am not anybody; I am Basil Huntford."" ""Ah, yes, now I remember. You said that in Berlin, when you came into my shop; yes, yes, I remember."" Basil made no comment upon this. They walked on in silence for some moments, and then the old man said suddenly, ""Tell me, are you a detective?"" Basil gave a start of surprise, and then laughed. ""No, I am no detective, "" he said. ""I am a soldier."" ""A soldier? Oh, then I am safe. I thought perhaps you were a policeman come to catch me."" ""No, I assure you, I am no policeman."" The old man sighed deeply. ""Ah, that is good. I was afraid. I am afraid of the police, because I am an escaped prisoner."" Basil felt a shock pass through him. He had been prepared to hear anything but this, and it startled him. He drew himself a little nearer to the old man and looked him straight in the face. ""An escaped prisoner, Herr Vollmer?"" he said quickly. ""Yes, yes, a prisoner of war. It is nothing, nothing at all, only that I was so tired of the barrack room."""	1913	1926.6974

"A few men may profess to despise it, but, as the number of those who play it is large, the few are soon silenced. In the sophomore year, when the game is better understood, cheating is so common that it is not even thought of as wrong. It is simply a part of the game, and the freshman who does not cheat gets little sympathy. He is called a grind. The junior year is the one which makes men. The freshman and sophomore years are spent in making acquaintances; the junior year finds out who are friends. The men who have been the best fellows, and the ones who have been the most selfish, stand out clearly. The best and truest friendships are made in this year. In the senior year the friendships are cemented, but the year itself is a poor one. The excitement of the junior year is over; the real work of the course is done; the end is in sight, and the spirit is gone. The work is all of a piece. The course is one which is supposed to develop the mind, and the tests are given to see how much of the development has taken place. The tests are given in the form of written exercises, called "" themes, "" and of oral exercises, called "" examinations."" The theme is the first test which the student meets in college, and it is the first which he comes to regard as a real test."	1911	1895.5348
(4) 90-0 „ ) These results were not so good as those obtained with the 3 in. strips, but as the test was made at the end of the summer, when the air was more humid, it was thought possible that the proofing might not be so effective. The seam was therefore remade, and tested at the end of winter, when the air was dry. The results were as follows: — (1) 84-0 lbs.) (2) 94-0 „ (Mean, 48-2 lbs. per inch or (3) 91-0 „ ( 845 kgs. per metre. (4) 98-0 „ ) These results are better than those obtained in the summer, but they do not show any advantage in using 2 in. strips instead of 3 in. strips. It therefore seems that, as regards the width of the strips, the seam is as good as it can be made with the method of binding described above. (c) The strips were made of 3 in. wide cotton cloth, and were sewn on with a double seam, the width of the double seam being J in. The strips were then doubled back and sewn on with a single seam, the distance between this seam and the edge of the strip being J in. The middle of the double seam was thus 1 in. from the edge of the strip. The proofing was then applied to the outside of the double seam, and the inside was left unproofed.	1912	1898.1376

The road ran to the foot of the hill, and from the top of the hill ran direct to the fords of the Colne, the most easterly of the Thames tributaries that could be used as a line of advance to London. The hill was steep and isolated, and the mound upon its summit was already the site of a church. The Thames, the great line of advance from the west, ran a mile from the foot of the hill, but the castle could be easily supplied from a point on the river just above the present village of Old Windsor, and the position was sufficiently near to the capital to make a raid upon London easy. It was, in fact, the one strong point which the Conqueror had established within striking distance of London. The other great castles, London, Colchester, Cambridge, Lincoln, Warwick, Nottingham, and York, were all upon lines of advance to the capital much longer, and the establishment of a great royal garrison at Windsor was a direct challenge to the City of London, the old capital of Wessex. But the position had one grave defect. It was isolated, and the only line of retreat was by the road over Stains Bridge. The road was well protected by the large and warlike manor of Staines, and the old Roman fort at the foot of the hill, which had been long since converted into a church and monastery, though the earthworks were still visible.	1912	1877.6324

I know of a number of instances of Welshmen and Englishmen who have been offered large salaries to teach Chinese children in America.

They are taken to the police station, and flogged, and go out again as worse than before. I could tell you many stories about that. It is a thing that is being done every day. And, of course, the Indian mind, with its traditions, believes in the use of force as a means of government, and does not understand the English feeling on that subject. It does not understand the English dislike of the use of force, and the Indian officials are taught to use it. It is part of the method of government. When I was in India the chief of the police in Bombay was an Englishman, and I was told that he was the only Englishman in India who had been reprimanded for excessive use of force.	1914	1889.1265

"This system of lighting has been fitted by the English Electric Company, and the accompanying illustration (fig. 525) shows how it has been arranged in the boardroom of the publishing house in question. The lighting is effected by means of "" Pilot "" lanterns, to which reference is made in a previous article in this series. These lanterns consist of opal glass bowls, fitted with Osram lamps. The bowls are suspended by means of chains from the ceiling, and in addition to producing a soft, even illumination, contribute to the general aesthetic effect of the room. The English Electric Company are also responsible for the installation of a similar system of lighting in the boardroom of the Royal Automobile Club. A Noval Type Lamp. This is illustrated in fig. 526, and is very suitable for fans and other small machines. The base has a quick action spring device for fitting to the standard. The reflector is constructed on the Holophane principle, and is made of crystal glass. The electrical part is completely fittid into the base, and the reflector is attached by a bayonet joint. The lamp, therefore, when broken, can be easily renewed without disturbing the reflector. As the latter does not touch the electrical part, the reflector is always cool, and the lamp can therefore be adjusted at any moment. A 40W, Ediswan lamp is used."	1912	1879.8334
"The American Inquiry is full of weaknesses, follies, unpardonable errors. The above mentioned is not one of them. The Inquiry took place in the midst of a great cyclone of public feeling, and the miserable, muddled, incompetent, frantic, and panic driven search for scapegoats, which followed the disaster, must not blind us to the good work which the Inquiry did. The English outcry against it is the outcry of those who realise that what it had to tell was something they did not want told. And this is the whole explanation of the campaign of vilification, misrepresentation, and malignity in which English journalism has indulged in regard to the American Inquiry. It is a campaign which has, of course, been inspired by the shipowners. The shipowners are at the bottom of the present miserable muddle about the safety of life at sea. They are wholly to blame for the fact that there have been no new requirements since the loss of the Empress of Ireland on Victoria Day last year, a loss which was due to the inadequacy of the lifeboat gear and the lifeboat accommodation. With hardly a month gone since that terrible calamity, which cost close upon a thousand human beings their lives, those responsible for the safety of life at sea, in the London and Westminster Gazette, which is owned by Sir John Ellerman, the millionaire shipowner, we find Dr. Andrew Wilson, whose reputation for being a sea expert is rather based on his own boasts than on his own achievements, denouncing as "" unnecessary and mischievous "" the lifeboat requirements recently laid down by the American Department of Commerce and Labour, on the recommendation of the American Inquiry."	1911	1908.6573
"the benefit of their labours is so great."" Again, in 1623, the Virginia Company reported that the Planters were ""daily growing rich."" In 1630, the Committee of the Virginia Company stated that ""the summe wherewith our planters are enriched . . . hath caused them to thinke their returne is now worth the while."" These early profits were based upon tobacco culture. In 1629, the Company reported a loss of three fourths of their income through the tobacco ""overplanting"" of their servants. It was this overplanting, caused by the security and economy of the servant labour, that made necessary the shift to other crops, which eventually brought about the diversified and self-supporting economy of the North. The early reliance upon tobacco culture alone, and the overplanting, were directly responsible for the long period of poverty in Virginia, following the early prosperity."	1913	1907.0967
The coefficients which have been determined during the past year are those necessary for the calculation of the stability in the pitch and roll directions of a monoplane, and the stability in yaw and roll of a biplane. In addition to this work on stability, an extensive series of experiments has been made on the determination of the resistance of single surfaces and of pairs of surfaces both coplanar and at an angle to one another. The work was carried out at the request of the Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, and the results have been published in the Reports of the Advisory Committee. The work is of great practical importance, and it is hoped that the Committee may again be able to find the means to continue it during the coming year.	1912	1913.734

It should be remembered that in painting the landscape out of doors the artist can use two palettes, one for the general effect, so to speak, and the other one for the close or minute work. This is impossible in the interior study, and the palette must be chosen accordingly, and yet contain those elements which will unite all parts into one harmonious whole. In the ordinary interior study two palettes are generally used — one for the background and another for the figures; these are sometimes never united, and the whole painting lacks cohesion. The student should not indulge in these luxuries, but should first learn to do as the artist has to do in the outdoor study — make one palette serve his turn. In landscapes, no less than in figure subjects, the colour should be studied to explain the action of the motif. The maiden in blue, walking rapidly in the green landscape, is not a true rendering of the colour which we associate with speed; warm colours should be chosen for that. We feel, instinctively, that a red house has something to do with the warm and sunny days of summer, and that a green or grey one is more in harmony with winter; we are not conscious of the feeling, but it is there just the same. So we associate the lush, rich green of summer with joyous, happy feelings, but are not conscious of the fact that the green of autumn gives us a different sensation.	1912	1889.4865

"The third and last term of the question is: What is the workman's mission ? To answer it, you must understand the mission of the epoch; the mission of the third period of the social evolution of the peoples; the mission of that period which is at the present moment opening before us."" The third and last term of his programme was the world republic. Thus he had a threefold faith to preach as the antidote to materialism and the selfish individualism of the nineteenth century. This faith, he declared, was indispensable to the welfare and progress of every nation. ""Whatever be the starting point, "" he said in ""The Duties of Man, "" ""the conscience of man is everywhere the same; the mission of the peoples and of nations is everywhere the same; the ideal is everywhere the same; it is God, it is Humanity, it is the interdependence of the human family, the Unity of the human race."""	1911	1941.4725
The first year a man is detailed to label and determine a certain collection, consulting books for what he does not already know; the second year he is allowed to collect a little on his own account, and is further instructed in the study of the literature; the third year he is allowed to work up a small collection of his own, and is further instructed in the study of the literature; the third year he is allowed to work up a small collection of his own, and is required to make an extended collection; the fourth year he is required to make a large collection, and is free to work up anything he needs for his own purposes. At the end of this period he has done considerable work for the museum, and he is prepared to enter on the study of a special subject for his doctorate.	1911	1898.2322
In short, the new act provides for a gradual and peaceful evolution of industrial liberty out of industrial slavery. It is the first attempt to establish a satisfactory relation between government and the economic organisation of society, and it stands for a new and revolutionary idea. It is essentially a scientific remedy for a scientific disease. It represents the application of the principles of political liberty to industry, and, in that sense, it is gallantly progressive. When the new act was under consideration by our legislators, the old remedy for the trust evil was advocated by a few men of influence. These were seized upon by the representatives of the organisation of monopoly as their champions, and a vigorous fight was made to force a Sherman clause into the new act.	1911	1902.141
They have in fact paid an amount of practical assistance to the settlers far greater than ever was paid under the Homestead Act in the United States. And they are fully aware of the difficulties which lie ahead. They are alive to the fact that the chief difficulty is that of water, and they are taking practical steps to meet that difficulty. They propose to sink boreholes, and they will thus enable farmers to draw water from a great depth, where it is available, by means of windmills. The advantages of these boreholes are said to be twofold. In the first place, when water is to be had from the boreholes, the farmer is able to concentrate his attention upon the cultivation of his land, instead of having to wander about from place to place in search of water.	1908	1886.4688
"The next day was a busy one for the pastor. He went to see the wheelwright, who had been the first to sign the list, and found him in his shop alone. He was glad to see him, for he had been afraid that the man might be angry because he had not been made chairman. He told him of his fears, and was greatly relieved when he heard the wheelwright's hearty laugh. ""I was afraid, "" he said, "" that you were going to ask me to be the secretary. I am too busy for that. I will be the first to borrow money, if you want to know that. I want a new wheel for my wagon."" ""I thought you had a new one last year, "" said the pastor."	1913	1901.4159

"And now, "" said the Colonel, as he glanced at his watch, ""the hour has come. We are to make our first attack upon the enemy, and for that purpose we will divide into two parties. One will proceed to the House of Commons, the other to the House of Lords. I will lead the first party, and Mr. Murdock will take charge of the second. You all know what you have to do. The House of Commons will be crowded with the leaders of the nation, and you will find at least one of the enemy there, the Prime Minister himself. You are to take him alive, if possible, and the same applies to the members of the Cabinet. If they resist, shoot them down. You understand ? "" "" Yes, sir, "" we all answered. "" Well, then, go ! "" "" Forward ! "" shouted Murdock, waving his sword ; and we dashed down the street towards Westminster, where the glare of the searchlights shone upon the great buildings, and the booming of the cannon sounded in the distance. The streets were deserted, and we met no one. But as we neared Westminster Bridge we saw a great crowd of the enemy massed upon it, and a small army of soldiers and policemen trying to clear them away. The troops were firing blank cartridges, and a number of searchlights were glaring upon the crowd, who shouted and yelled in defiance of the soldiers. "" "" Stand back, you fools ! "" cried a voice in the crowd. """	1906	1886.6395
"years, but this was no excuse for the liberties he took. In the first of them he united the two plays now known as A Shrew, and A Shrew was the only one in vogue till after the revival of The Tempest in 1840. Quin's version had a prologue and epilogue, and more than a hundred lines were added, most of them, according to his enemies, by his own hand. The two latter were original and licentious, and, as was said by a contemporary critic, ""designed to make the humour of a play, which had long lain dormant, to the licentious taste of the present age."" 1 The lovers were made to sigh in vain all through the first act, and the character of the Shrew was enlarged and improved into a heroine of the highest importance. This latter play now contains the same proportion of Shakespeare's writing as A Winter's Tale abridged by John Langford in 1767, or The Tempest, ""improved"" by Samuel Phelps in 1850. Quin's A Shrew had but three performances, and the audience was so thin, that he was obliged to send to the Green Room for women to fill the boxes, and thus encourage the pit to cheer and applaud. The alterations were continued by George, who in 1747 produced A Midsummer Night's Dream as a pantomime, with music and dances, the proper names of the characters altered to avoid scandal, for no one believed that Shakespeare's original could be defiled by the association of his glorious name with clogging and buffoonery."	1912	1876.9816
But my father and his companions were not disheartened. They knew that the money was safe — and so long as that was in their hands they hoped to be able to carry on the operations of the Government. What was to be done when the Germans entered the city, and how the money could be removed and taken to the more western counties, was, however, at the moment, a question of extreme difficulty. The removal of the gold was an operation which, as I have stated, was already in progress. Already — so great was the fear of a sudden German advance — orders had been given in the Bank to the carriers to hold themselves in readiness day or night to remove the gold from the Bank to the railway stations.	1906	1894.4857
He had seen the great white way, as it had been in the days of its glory, when the proud chariots of the Ccesars rattled along it, drawn by teams of spirited horses, and driven by stalwart slaves, who shouted lustily to clear the road of impediments, and to warn the peaceful and unexcited farmer, plodding along on his ass, with his panniers of vegetables. He had seen the road again, as it had been in the days when the Saxon raised his wooden house, and the Norman his castle, and the crusader went forth from the scene of the great pageant, to fight for his faith in the Holy Land. He had seen it in its mediaval splendour, when the pilgrims, clad in the garb of St. Thomas, passed to and fro, chanting the litanies of their saint. He had seen it again alive with the stir of the Reformation, and the courtly pageantry of the time of Elizabeth; and the thought which possessed him was that the great Roman, or Watling Street, should be once more a living, busy thoroughfare, and that its beauty should be crowned by a cathedral, and that cathedral the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady of the Angels. The vision was clear to him, and he saw the whole plan of the district, with the cathedral for its centre, and the country houses, convents, schools, and villages, which were to complete the work. He saw the pilgrims journeying to the shrine from far and near, and heard their litanies mingling with the song of the birds in the woods, and the rippling of the waters in the streams.	1908	1868.9501
"The Democratic candidate will probably be Mr. Bryan, who has already twice unsuccessfully contested the position. THE JUNGLE. The book called ""The Jungle, "" by Upton Sinclair, which has just been published in this country, has created a great stir in America, where it was originally published. The author, who is a Socialist, and who has lived for a time in Chicago, describes in the book the horrors of the meat packing trade. The book is written in the form of a novel, the hero being a Lithuanian peasant who emigrates to America. He makes a brief success of life in Chicago, but ultimately goes to the bad, and ends up by becoming a Socialist. The book is said to have caused a great sensation in Chicago, and to have resulted in many people joining the Socialist party."	1907	1967.5819
"Some of the electric lamps shown were of a very interesting character, but perhaps the most novel thing about this particular exhibition was the presence of ""gas "" in large quantities. This was not the gas in the form of illuminating material, but the actual "" gas "" itself which makes its appearance at electrical exhibitions — the "" anti gas"" of electricity. I have already referred to the fact that at the present time the gas companies are not only supplying their customers with gas for heating and cooking purposes, but have taken up the supply of electric light and power, and the electric companies in their turn have recognised the desirability of supplying their customers with gas. At the exhibition in question there was a large stand occupied by the Birmingham and Midland Counties Electric Power Company, and on this stand were shown gas cookers, gas fires, and gas radiators, all manufactured by the Birmingham Corporation Gas Works. I think this is a very significant fact. It is a distinct recognition of the truth that the two systems of lighting and heating are complementary, not antagonistic. The power company in question is supplying electrical energy to the Birmingham Corporation gas works, and they in turn are supplying gas to the customers of the power company. I have no doubt that this arrangement is a distinct advantage to the customers on both sides, for it enables the two companies to work together to mutual benefit."	1912	1910.7446

The scenery is said to be truly tropical, the growth of exotic trees and plants indicating a much warmer climate than what is usually experienced in this part of the world. Zuurberg is the name of a range of mountains, whose average elevation is about 4,000 feet. From the top, or pass, this range descends eastwards to the coast, but southwards the descent is much steeper, the depression at the Fish River being about 1,500 feet. The mountains are formed of a light-coloured granite, and by some are thought to be a continuation of Table Mountain. The otter and buck are to be met with in and around the ravines and bush-covered kloofs, and the leopard and lion still roam about the mountainous parts. The lion, however, has almost entirely disappeared since the completion of the railway, nearly all the great cats having been killed off by the railway employees, who for a long time were the only inhabitants of the country. Elephants and black rhinoceroses have not been seen in these parts for many years. Near Middleburg, which is 4,563 feet above the sea, and the highest town in the country, are several kopjes, or hills, that rise from 1,000 to 3,500 feet above the surrounding plains. The scenery here is grand, and at the foot of one of these mountains ran the river Baviaans, so named because large baboons once abounded in its gorges. One of the mountains on the north side of the river is called Naude's Nek, and it was here in August, 1901, that Professor Naude and I built, in honour of the well known scientist, a stone cairn which we named the Scientific Club Cairn.	1908	1908.2601
Lastly, the new borders of the Orissa and Bengal Divisions are marked by the Mahanadi from the borders of Chutia Nagpur to the sea, and by the Brahmani from its mouth to Talcher. MR. BARTLEMAN'S VIEW OF PAKISTAN. In January 1909 Mr. Bartleman, who had been appointed by the British Government as special correspondent in India to report on the Mahratta Movement, published his views as to the advisability of forming a separate Pakistan for the Mohammedans. These were that a Pakistan should be established, which, by guaranteeing the full civil and religious liberty of the Mahrattas, would thus set at rest the misgivings of the Mussulman League. The new province would comprise Punjab, Rajputana, and Sind, with portions of Bengal and the United Provinces. NEWFOUNDLAND FISHING. New licences are to be issued to the Newfoundland Fishermen for the American Fishing Rooms. The old licences are to be cancelled and the Newfoundland fishermen are to have the accidental advantage that the, American Fishermen will be kept off the Newfoundland Fishing Rooms altogether. The position is one which appears to be satisfactory to the Newfoundland Government, but not to the Newfoundland Fishermen themselves. SIR ALBERT SCOTT ON UNION. . In December 1909, Sir Albert Scott, the Premier of Newfoundland, expressed himself as favouring the idea of Union with Canada, but only on the understanding that the character of Newfoundland as a nation should not Diego Fernandez de Ezpeijro, a Spaniard, came to the islands when they were still entirely deserted, and he took possession of and christened them San Lazaro.	1907	1893.92
"(iv) The fourth method consisted in determining the energy lost by impact : a vertical jet was produced and the average velocity of the jet at one cross section, by the steps described above, was found to be •04629' The mean velocity of the water in the nozzle was determined by weighing a certain volume and measuring the time. The ratio of these two velocities is 0*71 : the corresponding value of Pi is 314, and the actual pressure Pi was found to be 288 lb. per sq. ft. (v) The fifth method and the one which corresponds most closely with the theoretical method was to measure the energy lost from the working surface of the jet to the free surface. The actual energy lost in the above sense was determined by using the formula PeAe = Paa plus the potential energy term, all the pressures being reduced to a plane corresponding with the vena contracta. This was compared with the theoretical value of the energy lost, which was obtained by applying the principles of fluid dynamics to the jet. The two values agreed very closely. In conclusion it is gratifying to record that the mean velocity of the jet obtained by the method of least squares was found to agree very closely with that obtained by the other methods. The result of these various methods of determining the velocity of the jet is summed up below, the first column giving the method, and the second the mean velocity so obtained : — I. Velocity Area Method . . .0401 II. "" .0413 III. By Pitot Tube . . . .0409 IV. By Pressure Face . . . .0480 V. Theoretical Velocity Area . .0452 VI.

"She has no idea how much the latter is mixed with evil; if she had she would be less eager for it. One night at a dinner party, when the hostess was rather at her wits' end to find a subject of conversation agreeable to all her guests, and not too serious for the men, one of them suddenly said, "" I wonder if the women will ever get the vote?"" ""Oh! for goodness' sake, don't let us talk about that!"" exclaimed one of the ladies. "" Yes, pray don't, it will make us quarrel, "" said another. "" Very well, then, let us talk about the other vote, "" said the man, "" that of the women!"" And the subject was changed. Women's love of change is one of the most agreeable of their little weaknesses. If they had not this, and the power of diversion which it gives, they would soon become unbearable, and they are often tiresome enough as it is. Change is the one thing needful to keep them sweet, and it is one of the best things in life for men also. One day in the year is not too much for a woman to spend in the society of her husband without his being jealous of the other men who share her smiles with him; and if he is wise he will often give her a whole day to herself, and the pleasure of a long drive or walk with some old friend who is not jealous of him."	1908	1883.5546
Care must also be taken to avoid any glaring reflections from the polished surface of the table. For this reason the plain wood borders and the matt finish on the rail tops are to be recommended, while the use of a high gloss finish on these surfaces should be avoided. In the Huidekoper billiard room, where the general lighting is provided by a beautiful chandelier in the centre of the ceiling, composed of a dozen or more lighted shields in a crown of antique weapons, the general illumination is supplemented by eight other local lights at mid height of the room on the walls; but these serve more to accent the moulding around the ceiling and to give the room a more lively appearance, than to benefit the players.	1912	1905.8136
"T. Monnet to D. Garrick, 29th April 1765. 1 British Museum Add. MSS., 33, 110, fol. 88. but a few extracts will perhaps suffice. Monnet's letters are written in a mixture of English and French, and the spelling is often phonetic. The following extract gives a good idea of the man's character, and of his devotion to Garrick : — "" Je n'ay pas encore reu de vos lettres, mais je suis persuaded que vous n'etes pas si ingrat que de ne me pas donner des preuves de votre amiti. Je suis tres afflige de ne pas avoir de vos nouvelles, mais je suis persuaded que vous avez des affaires tres pressantes qui vous occupent. Si je ne revois point de lettre de vous je me feray le tour de France pour vous trouver, et je ne quitterai point cette pays sans vous faire des compliments de vive voix. Je suis tres en peine de votre affaire avec M. le Duc de Richmond, je vous en supplie, ne vous laissez point abattre, je vous en conjure. Je suis persuaded que vous aurez gain de cause. Je suis tres aise que vous ayez reu de l'argent de votre pere, cela vous mettra en etat de faire des affaires."	1912	1861.5331
"As is usually the case with lawless crews, they held the captain in little or no respect; and when they found that he sided with me, they laid plans for mutiny. Those plans were carried out on the very night when I had rebuked the evildoers; and the ship was abandoned to its fate by captain and crew. We were later picked up by a vessel bound for Liverpool, and were told that the ship had been abandoned to the mercy of the waves. But we know that it struck on a rock, and went to the bottom with all its wicked crew."" "" And then you went back to England ? "" asked Dagmar. "" Yes, my daughter; but not before I had caused Jackson to be placed on board a good ship, bound for America. I felt that he was not fitted for missionary life, though he possessed many noble qualities, and was well read in the Scriptures. I never saw him again. He died, shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War, in which he had enlisted as a soldier. That is the story of my life as a missionary in the West Indies."" Claude's eyes were shining as, after a moment's reflection, he said, "" I think I can understand why you, of all men in the world, were sent to the British Colonies in the West Indies. God knew that you would never abandon any poor slave to the mercy of the crew on board a slave ship."" ""Yes, my son, it was with me as with every other one of God's creatures."	1908	1885.8381
The total cost of the installation, including mains, was about £150, and this sum was paid back in just over twelve months owing to the increase in trade through the better light. The premises were open until 10 p.m. each night, and the cost of the lighting was 31. 10s. per month. With the advent of electric lighting the necessity of the sign has been recognised, and we find it now illuminated with incandescent lamps, carbon or arc, and by neon tubing. The object of the illuminated sign is to draw attention to the shop when it cannot necessarily be seen on account of the waning light, or when people are passing in the evening, and the material of which such signs are constructed has been mentioned already.	1912	1907.1505
The female is furnished with a long ovipositor, which she uses to pierce the body of the caterpillar, or of some other host, in which her larva is to develop, and to deposit her eggs in the interior of the pierced body. The young larva, on hatching, is supplied by the host with a certain amount of nourishment, but this soon proves insufficient for its needs and it takes further food from the tissue of the host. The caterpillar, however, has not been able to discover the presence of the larva, and continues to provide for its welfare by feeding and regurgitating food. At length the caterpillar, quite unwittingly, performs the last service to its destroyer by going into the pupal stage; whereupon the Ichneumonid larva, having reached a size quite out of proportion to its host, seizes the opportunity to kill it by feeding on its nervous system and other vital organs.	1911	1890.8716
"This is the first mention of astronomy in the historical literature of China. The "" Lih ki, "" or Book of Rites, contains an extended discussion of the theory and methods of astronomy as understood by the learned Chinese in the second or third century b.c.., but whether these methods were the same in the time of the Emperor Yao (about 2200 B.C.) it is impossible to say. 1 The Shih chhi, or Historical Records, compiled by Ssema Chien in the first century b.c, contains a long biographical portion descriptive of the lives and works of ancient Chinese astronomers, and has been incorporated by Wylie in the collection above referred to. The early Chinese divided the year into winter and summer halves. The first winter half was called the "" six months of winter"" (tung fen), and included the first ten months of the year, beginning with the month of November. The ten months of winter were further divided into five months of medium cold (sii ch'ien) and five months of great cold (wu ch'in). The five months of medium cold corresponded to our November, December, January, February and March; the five months of great cold to our April, May, June, July and August. The five months of great cold have survived in popular usage and are known 1 Lih ki, Ti ming, or Book of the Calendar."	1911	1909.4738
The average Oregon voter is well informed regarding the issues presented. He reads the campaign literature; he studies the arguments for and against the proposed laws; he listens to the speeches on both sides, and then he decides the matter for himself. The result of this process is that he makes few mistakes. The record of the people in their exercise of the initiative and referendum powers is a remarkable one. In the ten years from 1904 to 1913, 58 measures were submitted under the initiative and 40 measures were referred. Of the 58 initiative measures, 46 were adopted and 12 rejected; of the 40 referred measures, 29 were upheld, 8 were rejected and 3 were not acted on. The people thus adopted 46 out of 58, or 79 per cent, of the measures proposed under the initiative, and upheld 29 out of 40, or 73 per cent., of the measures referred. They made mistakes in only 21 per cent, of the cases. It is a remarkable record. It is a record that the people of no other state or country can show. It demonstrates the practical wisdom of the people of Oregon. It proves that they are well able to govern themselves by direct vote on public measures. Initiative petitions must contain the signatures of 6 per cent, of the voters of the state, and referendums must be ordered by 5 per cent.	1911	1921.0707
Drag coefficients (Figs. 15 and 16). — The drag coefficients show much larger differences than the lift coefficients, particularly at the higher angles of incidence. For example, at 20 ft./sec. and 15° the drag coefficients are 0.196 and 0.126 for the model and full scale experiments on the Aerofoil No. 2 surface, respectively. The differences are less at 30 ft./sec, than at 20 ft./sec. and greater at 40 and 50 ft./sec. It appears that, at 30 ft./sec, the model experiments give larger drag coefficients than do the full scale experiments at any angle, and the discrepancies appear to be increasing as the angle of incidence increases. Above 30 ft./sec, the model experiments give lower drag coefficients than do the full scale experiments, and the discrepancies are increasing with the angle of incidence.	1912	1978.6993
In almost all cases the extensometer is the Ewing type, modified to give a trace on a moving strip of paper. The strain is usually recorded by a pencil tracing the paper ; the stress is recorded either by a second pencil or by a beam of light reflected from a piece of metal attached to the moving part of the extensometer. The record is thus a double one, the upper tracing giving the strain and the lower one the stress. The relative positions of the two traces give the rate of increase of stress with strain, which is the slope of the curve. 176. Measurement of Change of Temperature. — In many experiments on the mechanical properties of materials it is necessary to know the temperature of the specimen.	1908	1938.6044

On the way, if you sit on the right side, you see the great bluff of Inyanga rising very grandly to the west ; the two peaks of the Drakensberg further inland are often pointed out to you as you proceed. Johannesburg is only thirty miles away, being easily accessible, but it has none of the charm of Durban. I went there once only, spending a few hours in the township of Soweto, which was most interesting. It is built for and entirely occupied by the natives, numbering 300,000, and is very well laid out. There are wide streets, schools, hospitals, and houses built under the British flag and law, which are far better than thatched huts. It was moving to see the people, men, women, and children, coming out to stare at us as we passed by, and waves of greeting going round, as the various parties recognised their friends. And it is a safe and happy community, because there has never been crime there since it was first built. We were obliged to drive through hastily, but stopped a minute to buy some very clever and cheap work that was exposed for sale at the side of the road. The streets of Durban are very wide, and are lined with shops of all kinds, belonging to British, Jews, and Indians. Almost the only boots for sale are made in Germany, and the shopkeepers get them direct from the German firms without paying the very heavy import duty, which is evaded by passing them through Portuguese East Africa.	1908	1897.3839
"Towards the end of the last century England, and afterwards many other countries, repealed the laws declaring suicide a crime. In our days there is an almost general desire to soften the remaining severity with which the self murderer is treated. In 1882 a movement was made in Germany towards the abolition of the Act which considers the self murderer as having died intestate. The reason alleged for the change was simplicity and the avoidance of complication, but the supporters of the movement also relied on the more humane feelings of the present time. A further change appears probable in the not distant future, as a movement is going on towards the abolition of the medical inquisition with which the self murderer is still treated. In England, where this inquisition is most severe, the coroner has the right to order the body of an alleged suicide to be dissected and the brain to be preserved, and the medical man is usually obliged to preserve the brain for three years. The present coroner of London wishes to abolish this inquisition, and so does Dr. Maudsley, the well-known alienist. ""Our real need, "" says the latter, ""is some kind of healing supernatural force, some new spiritual energy which shall help us to rise above the evils of the present time, instead of fluttering with childish delight over the curious exhumed remains of a dead belief."	1908	1900.9304

"If the amplitude of the motion be very small, so that the strains are proportional to the displacements, the body is said to vibrate in accordance with the laws of ""linear"" or ""harmonic"" vibration. In this case the body moves to and fro in a fixed path, and the strains and stresses vary in intensity and direction with the same periodic time and are always proportional to the displacements. 159. Forced Vibrations. — If the disturbing force be constant the motion is rectilinear and the body moves in the direction of the force with a gradually increasing velocity until the constraint is exhausted. Then, if the disturbing force be removed, the body moves with a gradually decreasing velocity, the time of motion being governed by the damping or resistance."	1908	1938.4442
"A low moan escaped her. "" If you can't, I can't, Enid. What is it? I saw it was serious, and that Mr. Coryston didn't want to tell me. You must tell me! "" "" I might have known that Arthur would never let me hear the end of it, "" she said, veiling her eyes. "" It's a letter. A letter to him from his father. He died at Madeira two years ago. He was a very rich man. Poor Arthur was never reconciled to him, never forgiven. But the man had some good feeling left in him. This letter seems to have been meant to make amends. It expresses the old man's desire to see Arthur. There is money — provision — rising to a sum of half a million for Arthur — if he will come back, and make a home with his father before he dies."	1913	1915.9938
and EAST northeast. passing over the buildings is thrown into a turbulence of considerable complexity, and it is hoped that the study of the behaviour of this eddy may throw some light on the phenomena of gusts and of winds with an irregular direction which are met with in some districts. A small structure was also erected on the summit of Pyrton Hill, a few feet from the edge of the steep scarp slope to the south of the hill. At the time of writing no observations have been taken from this structure, but the eddies caused by the wind passing the edge of the slope will no doubt be of some interest. 1.  Part II.

The point on which I would dwell is the one you touch on last — the danger of the present split in the women's movement. You say that all the women who have written to you about it are in favour of the militant policy, and that you have never been able to find anyone who condemned it. Well, you haven't met the right people, I suppose, for I have met a good many who condemned it. But I am not concerned to plead their cause. The point I want to put forward is that, while I am in favour of the militant policy, I think it is a mistake to say, ' If you are not with us, you are against us.' It is a mistake to take up an attitude of contempt towards the women who are not with us. It is a mistake to say, ' We are the only true suffragists.' We are not. The women who are not with us on the militant policy are not necessarily false suffragists, and they are not necessarily women who have been corrupted by the men. They are women who, after long consideration, have come to the conclusion that the old policy is the best. They are women who have weighed the question, and have decided against the new policy. And if they have done that, they are in a position to support us even better than those who are with us, for they have taken up the attitude of the true neutral in war, and are therefore in a position to give us all their time and all their energy and all their money for the cause of Woman's Suffrage.	1911	1938.2848
30 Thus a party may assign special taxes which have been levied in pursuance of a statute authorising the same, and a contract for the performance of municipal work, and the bond accompanying such a contract. 1 An assignment of moneys due or to become due by the state for work done or materials furnished is valid, though the law should not provide for such assignment. 2 The right to assign does not depend on the fact of consideration, but exists in all cases unless expressly prohibited. 5 Thus a corporation may assign a contract, under seal, which it is authorised by its charter to make, and for the performance of which it has given its note. 4 The assignment of a claim being legal, the assignee may, where he is the owner and has the title to the claim, make himself the plaintiff and sue thereon in his own name, and without joining the assignor. 5 In the absence of express prohibition the following contracts are assignable: The contract of a shipbuilder against the owner of a vessel, for the balance due on the contract	1913	1853.493

"Jackson was a great democrat and his administration is justly credited with many democratic achievements, but it was also marked by several acts that savoured of aristocracy and despotism. The most notable of these was the nullification controversy, which arose in South Carolina in 1831-32 as a result of the agitation against the protective tariff. Under the leadership of John C. Calhoun, Jackson's vice president, South Carolina adopted an ordinance of nullification declaring that the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and therefore null and void in that state. Congress, however, had passed a law in 1832 reducing the rates of the tariff of 1828, and Jackson declared the ordinance of nullification to be incompatible with the perpetuity of the Union, and therefore, ""not law."" By a proclamation he appealed to the people of South Carolina to rescind the obnoxious ordinance. Congress also passed a force bill authorising the President to use armed forces to compel obedience to the laws of the Union. The controversy was finally settled by Henry Clay's compromise tariff, but Jackson's attitude was that of a great centralised government and not of one of the common people. Jackson was also responsible for the destruction of the United States Bank, which was the greatest moneyed corporation in the country and the charter of which had been approved by Congress. This act, however, was in keeping with the democratic principles of the time and the President's avowed opinions."	1911	1929.591
The British fleet was lying off the entrance to the bay, and Perry, fearing a retreat by the enemy, hoisted his pennant on the Lawrence, and gallantly stood for the foe. During the night of September 9, 1813, the Lawrence and Niagara were anchored close together, and Perry slept between decks on the Lawrence. The wind was light and the weather squally, and the British were slow in getting under way. It was not until after ten o'clock that they hoisted their sails. Perry was then close in with the Niagara, and, seeing the enemy would pass him to windward, he bore up and ran down to windward of the enemy's line. The battle was then raging, and Perry was in the midst of the enemy's fire. He was a target for the guns of the whole British fleet, and his ship was in the most exposed position. But he was the admiral, and he must take the post of honour and danger. The Lawrence was the first ship to engage, and Perry's pennant was the first to be shot down. Captain Elliott, of the Niagara, was a brave man, but he was a coward on that day. He was so afraid the Lawrence would be destroyed that he did not obey Perry's orders to come to the rescue. Perry's flag was shot down three times, and each time the gallant commander of the Lawrence caused it to be replaced by another flag, bearing the same motto.	1913	1879.2263
"I was the only one on whom the attendant wasted his time twice. After a while the hojas began to get up and to go out, one by one, the while solemnly nodding to one another. A few minutes later I too got up and passed out into the street. I was curious to see what would happen next. I saw that the hojas had not dispersed. They were gathered in little groups, and were now discussing the questions of the day. The cafe had only been a place of meeting, a sort of preliminary assembly, a ""caucus."" The real work of the day was to be done out in the open air. I was in the city of AIdin, in the province of Asia Minor, and the scene I have described is a daily scene in every town and village of Turkey."	1913	1936.8671

"" I suppose there are no very important differences between being a soldier and a sailor, are there ? "" ""Oh, very great, very great, indeed, "" I replied. "" In the first place, a soldier, unless he is in the artillery or engineers, is almost entirely cut off from the use of machinery, while a sailor is practically always employed in that way; and then, instead of the unending monotony of life on land, sailors have the constant change of scene that comes with a life on the ocean waves."	1911	1893.7902
"We are, however, of opinion that the establishment of colonies in British possessions — not on the lines suggested by Mr. Rider Haggard, but by the provision of loans to settlers in the manner described in the report of the Committee of the Colonial Conference of 1902, and of the Committee of the British Association, which met at Toronto in 1905, — is a matter which deserves further consideration. We are, therefore, of opinion that a committee should be appointed for this purpose, and we beg to commend the following terms of reference to your Majesty's Ministers: — ""To inquire into the desirability and feasibility of establishing colonies in British possessions, in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of the Colonial Conference of 1902, and of the Committee of the British Association, which met at Toronto in 1905, and to report thereon."""	1907	1871.2649
"I had no money, and I was too proud to ask my husband to pay my debts. I was so wretched, I could not sleep at night. I could not eat. I had lost my appetite completely. I looked like a ghost. I was afraid to go out, I was afraid to stay in, I was afraid to see my husband, I was afraid to be without him. I was simply terrified. I could not think clearly, I could not reason. I was like a mad woman. I had no one to advise me, no one to help me. I could not go to my husband and say, ""I am in debt, I am in trouble, will you help me?"" I could not do that. I could do nothing except suffer. One night Herbert and I were sitting in the drawing-room at Marsh Manor. He was reading, and I was looking at a magazine. I was feeling miserable, and I could not shake off the feeling. I had never told Herbert I was subject to neuralgic headaches. I had never told him I had had one since our wedding day. But that night I had a terrible one. I could not hide it from him. I put my hands up to my forehead, and closed my eyes. He looked up. ""You are ill, Laura, "" he said. ""What is the matter?"" ""Nothing, "" I answered, forcing myself to speak. ""I am only a little tired."" ""You are not tired, "" he said. ""You are ill."	1906	1926.2406
"""Nothing. . . . She was simply young and beautiful. And the men of the neighbourhood, tempted by the beauty of her youth, used to sit on the fence in front of her father's house and boast of their prowess, and sing, and shout, and quarrel among themselves for the right to approach the house. The women of the neighbourhood, more jealous than the men, used to sit upstairs at the windows in the front of their houses, and point her out as she walked, and call to one another: 'There she goes!' She went about her own affairs: she went to church, and prayed, and worked, and waited on her parents, and visited the sick, and gave thanks for blessings in her life. She never seemed to notice the men sitting on the fence, or the women at the windows. She was young and beautiful, and she cared nothing for her youth and beauty. If she ever heard the jeers and shouts of the men, or the taunts and threats of the women, she gave no sign. But one bright Sunday morning her father came in from church and placed a sword on the mantel shelf. He was very angry, and came in unsteadily. He had been drinking.

"This he did by the invention and application of the method of studying the action of polarized light upon the various optical isomers of the same compound. The answer to this question was that the atoms are arranged in space in accordance with the so-called tetrahedral and hexagonal schemes. This work, done between 1874 and 1878, made Want Hoff famous at once, and he was known as the discoverer of stereochemistry. His next great work was in connection with the so-called van der Waals equation, which is a more general equation of state for gases and vapours than the ideal gas equation, and which contains two constants, a and b, which can be determined experimentally, and which are a measure of the molecular attraction and volume respectively. Want Hoff was the first to show that the values of these constants could be calculated from the molecular formula by the application of the principle of corresponding states. This was done in his famous book ""Gas 1 He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1901. 2 I am indebted to Dr. J. H. Van 't Hoff for the material for this sketch. 3 Theory, "" published in 1881. The third great work of Want Hoff was done after he came to Berlin. It was in connection with the so-called dilute solutions, and showed that the molecular weights of dissolved substances could be calculated from the osmotic pressure, and that the van der Waals equation could be extended to include solutions, and that the constants a and b could be calculated from the molecular formula of the solvent."	1911	1922.3167
When the attention of the profession was called to the appalling mortality from this method of stamping out smallpox, they sought to shield themselves behind the cry that it was the fault of the government for not making the inoculation compulsory. As a matter of fact, the government did not then, and has never since, made compulsory the inoculation of the people with smallpox. They only required that they should be vaccinated with cowpox, which they believed to be a mild and harmless form of smallpox. The medical profession of today, notwithstanding the vast advances made in medical science, is still bound hand and foot to the methods and theories of the ancient and mediaeval past. And it is only fair to say that this bondage is the result of a misconception of the principles of scientific research and the rush to adopt and proclaim as scientifically correct, those theories which are the product of the imagination, rather than the result of careful and laborious investigation. The medical profession today is dominated by the theory of the germ as a cause of disease, and the idea that the introduction of disease germs into a healthy system will cause the same modification of the germ that the introduction of the germ of cowpox into the system will cause. That is, instead of causing the disease known as smallpox, it will cause a modified form of that disease, which will be so light that it will be hardly more than an attack of infantile colic.	1911	1892.8627
If, then, the onomatopoetic and the exclamatory theories are untenable, what is left ? An answer to this question is offered in the so-called mental or psychological theory. According to this view the earliest words were not imitative or exclamatory, but were names of things, of actions, of qualities, etc., which arose in the following way. Man, it is assumed, was from the beginning a rational being, endowed with reason and language. He had a consciousness of his own personality and of his relation to his environment. He thought, and in thinking he had a knowledge of the objects of which his thoughts were about. In other words, he had ideas. These ideas naturally needed a vehicle of expression, and this vehicle was furnished in the form of the word. Such is, in brief, the most important tenet of the mental theory. The objection to it is that it is not based on fact. The theory assumes a consciousness and a knowledge of ideas that could not possibly exist until language was well developed. The further assumption is made that the word is an arbitrary sign of the idea, that the idea is the cause and the word the effect, that the word is the label attached to the idea and that the two are in no way related. But it is a well known fact that the word is not an arbitrary sign of the idea, and that the idea is not the cause and the word the effect. The word is itself the result of a long and complex process of evolution.	1911	1894.432

In the temples of the money god pile high the offerings of human suffering and degradation, of broken hearts and shattered lives, of innocence betrayed, of virtue sacrificed, of health destroyed, of young manhood and womanhood poisoned and crippled. The worshippers of the God of Profit want no incense, no songs of praise, no banners. They want gold, and silver, and jewels, and fine linen. The victims of their greed may perish by the wayside, but they are heedless of the suffering. If the ways of the God of Profit lead them through the slums, and through the hospitals, and through the graveyards, they do not care, so that at the end of the journey they may have their golden fleece. 20   He cares not for the plight of the toiler in factory and shop, in mine and field, in office and store, if only he can make the toil of the toiler yield the largest returns.

"The New Zealander of British stock is a good type of man. He is physically vigorous and has a good mind."" These are the words of Mr. W. J. Linton, a careful observer who has spent considerable time in New Zealand, and they are the testimony of an impartial witness. It is true that the conditions which he describes are not to be found in the larger cities of New Zealand, but even there the conditions are not so bad as in the corresponding places in England. The chief features of the social system of New Zealand are the land policy and the system of old age pensions. The land policy is based on the principle that the land should be owned by the people and not by a few rich men."	1911	1920.5499
"That the present life is a state of probation, to be followed for the righteous by the beatific vision and for the wicked by eternal separation from God, or, as the Bible expresses it, ""everlasting punishment."" This is the substance of what the Bible teaches. It is a message from God to man, a revelation of the unseen world, and of our relation to it and to God. 106  CHAPTER IX  THE BIBLE IN HISTORY  To the student of philosophy the Bible is of the first importance as a factor in the history of human thought. It is a great mistake to suppose that the Biblical idea of God has been developed in modern times. It has been the controlling idea in the thought of mankind from the beginning. The great thinkers of every age have been those who have held high and pure conceptions of God, and their influence has been moulding that of the Bible. The Bible has been the chief instrument in shaping the thought and character of mankind."	1908	1929.308
"When the smoke cleared away, only the dead and wounded remained. The gunnery officer, Lieutenant H. L. B. Campbell, was killed. The gun's crew had suffered, and the gun was out of action. 1 The destruction of the German dreadnoughts was, of course, no new thing for the British Fleet. The German High Seas Fleet had never before been in action against the British Grand Fleet, and had never before suffered such losses. But, as Sir John Jellicoe has pointed out, the loss of dreadnoughts is not the same thing as the loss of armoured cruisers, and the British Fleet, when it went into action, was prepared for the worst. "" We had made up our minds, "" says Sir John Jellicoe, "" to lose a certain number of dreadnoughts."	1906	1918.7896

This will give a tree with three or four scaffold branches, all well spaced around the trunk and with a good head of laterals on each scaffold branch. For the fourth season, if the tree has made a good growth, one or two more scaffold branches can be added by following the same course as in the first three years. In some orchards, vigorous trees are allowed to go two years with only the one heading back, and the new branches are then selected and headed back to be one half or two thirds as strong as the first scaffold branches. This method is advocated by some because it gives a more rapid growth of trunk and the tree is more upright. On the other hand, a tree with a good head of branches the first three years develops a much larger tree at the end of five years than one with only a few scaffold branches.	1914	1937.4878
"As regards the lighting of the interior of the trains, this is effected by means of gas, and the lamps are so arranged that the light is directed upwards on to the roof, which is painted white, and the reflection thus obtained gives a very diffused and agreeable light. The gas is supplied from a gas tank fitted under the carriage, and the gas is conveyed to the lamps by means of copper tubing. The lamps are provided with automatic lighting apparatus, so that it is only necessary for the guard to turn on the gas, and the lamps are lit automatically. The cost of this form of lighting is very small, being only about 2d. per car mile. The gas used is that from the ordinary coal gas works, and the pressure is about 5 inches water gauge. The average consumption per lamp is 1/4 cubic foot per hour. The duration of the gas tanks is about 2 hours, and the tanks are recharged at the stations. The lighting of the trains by gas has been in operation for some years, and has been found to give the greatest satisfaction. The author desires to express his indebtedness to Mr. H. T. Harrison, M.I.C.E., for his kindness in allowing him to make use of the information contained in his paper on "" The Lighting of Railway Stations, "" and also for the use of the illustrations."	1912	1879.2333

But the bulk of his readers will be glad to turn from his somewhat cold description of the Theistic movement, to the more stirring chapters which follow, and which tell the thrilling story of the rise and spread of the cult of the goddess Durga. SIMON NEWCOMBE, Geodesist and Astronomer. By James W. Redway, Ph.D. (New York: D. Appleton & Co., 1911. Pp. 215.) n the modern world the geodesist and the astronomer are respectively the geometrician and the physicist. The principal instrument of the former is the theodolite; of the latter the telescope. The function of the geodesist is to measure the earth; of the astronomer to measure the heavens. In one branch of physical measurement, however, that of time, the astronomer has taken an especially prominent part; a reflection of the prominence which time measurements have held during the nineteenth century. The most conspicuous figure among the American geodesists and astronomers of the nineteenth century — indeed of the entire century — is Simon Newcombe. Not only was he pre-eminent with respect to each class of measurements, but he was pre-eminent in both. He was head of the United States Naval Observatory for a number of years, and during all these years he was also the chief astronomer and geodesist of the United States.	1908	1895.339
It was, however, a religion of liberalism and light, perhaps more than of love or warmth, and being so it could not be expected to long hold the allegiance of the masses of the people. In fact, its only hope of being propagated at all depended upon its inheriting the spirit of the missionary impulse which had given such strong force to the spread of orthodox, evangelical Christianity, and that spirit it has not shown itself to possess in any considerable degree. Its message for humanity was reasonably regarded as philanthropic and unifying, but not as binding in its obligations, and so a mere intellectual or religious liberalism could not be permanently and practically satisfying. Many who accepted its teaching did not practically realise the significance of the fact that it virtually denied the divinity of Christ. The thought of denying the divinity of love and goodness seemed to them so preposterous that they could not associate that denial with the denial of the divinity of Christ. And so, though the Unitarian churches have called to them many spiritually minded and broad thinking people and have done a good work in the world, yet, as a whole, they have not been able to retain within their fold those people who feel the need of something more binding and compelling than an intellectual and personal liberalism. Unitarianism, however, should not be regarded as a passing phase of religious thought and life.	1911	1869.3171

The heaviest precipitation, as a rule, occurs in the vicinity of the warm front; but the cold front is not to be dismissed lightly, for it, too, is sometimes the scene of heavy precipitation. a. clouds and precipitation in the warm sector. — While the air is generally dry in the warm sector, and while there are many instances of clear weather, there is a possibility of light precipitation occurring anywhere in the warm sector. If precipitation does occur it is light and may take the form of rain, snow, sleet, or glaze, depending on the temperature. The clouds are broken stratus, cumulus, or cumulonimbus. The latter may occur anywhere, but is most common over the eastern half of the warm sector.

He wrote to an old friend in New York, asking for a position as bookkeeper in his firm, and in a week was on his way to the city, promising Alma he would soon be back again. He was gone three weeks, and when he returned, he said, cheerily, as they sat together on the porch of their little house, that he had been very successful in his business. He had a good position, and was well paid. He had a chance to earn more, if he would only take the trouble to do so. He had to go to New York once a week, but he would be home every Saturday night, and would not stay away a single Sunday. Alma was delighted. She was so glad he had succeeded so soon.	1913	1900.6254
In this condition they may easily be confused with the young caterpillars of lepidoptera of which they are natural enemies. If then the warm dampness induces the pupae to change to the larval stage, these heliotropic larvae may easily be caught by birds, and thus their life endangered. However, this misfortune is avoided by the subsequent change to the negative heliotropism. It was found by Filippi that the young larvae of Chrysorrhcea were most active in their search for food, just prior to the change to the negative heliotropism; and, as a matter of fact, this change occurs just at the time when the first brood of lepidopterous caterpillars are out, and, therefore, when the young larvae of Chrysorrhcea might find them as food. Thus by the change of the heliotropic sensitiveness the danger to the life of these larvae is avoided and they may enter into the competition with their food animals. The same is true for the change in the heliotropic sensitiveness of the young locusts. The young hoppers are first positively heliotropic and jump towards the light. When they have changed to the solitarious state the heliotropic sensitiveness becomes negative and they then jump away from the light. In this way the danger of being lost in the darkness of the ground is avoided. The change to the gregaiious state is accompanied by a second change in the heliotropic sensitiveness, for in the gregarious state the young hoppers again become positively heliotropic, and then by marching from the darkness into the light, and remaining there, they may induce the same heliotropic change in the solitarious hoppers, thus attracting them to the swarming and gregarious life.	1911	1924.2787
"Two ideas, for example, have been placed in the same class; it is then assumed that they are of the same order, and the following inference is drawn: if three ideas are in the same class, they are of the same order, and therefore, if one of them has a certain property, the other two have the same property. This principle is evidently false. It is based on the supposition that classes are real entities, and that two classes which are placed in the same order are of the same rank in the universe. The truth is, Buffon pointed out, that the only real classes are those of the imagination, and that the ""natural classes"" of the systematists are figments of the imagination. The same reasoning applies to the relations of genera and species. If the different species of a genus are not real entities, it follows, Buffon pointed out, that the disputes which have arisen between the partisans of the specific and the generic methods of classification are wholly futile. The specific method has been defended on the ground that it classifies individuals in the smallest possible classes; the generic method has been defended on the ground that it groups together all the species of a genus in a single class; but both are equally fictitious and imaginary, because neither species nor genus has an existence outside the mind. Thus the preliminary discourse to the natural history of Buffon, as a whole, is a statement and application of the principle that has just been set forth."	1911	1890.242

As the air rises, it cools and becomes increasingly unsaturated. Eventually, it reaches the top of the mountain range as a temperature inversion. On the windward side, it has dropped all of its moisture as precipitation. Over the mountain top, it is a dry, stable, and relatively warm mass of air. On the leeward side, it descends. As it descends, it warms at a higher rate than the dew-point temperature rises, and thus the air becomes increasingly saturated. The result is a marked rain shadow. Practically no precipitation falls after the air reaches the mountain top. 14 The fact that the air is a little warmer than the air at the same level over the coastal plain, accounts for the temperature inversion. e. Weather and Climate Weather is here taken to mean the condition of the atmosphere in a relatively short period of time. It is this phenomenon that man has always been most interested in, for it is the weather that has the immediate effect on his activities. The study of weather has been largely a study of changes in temperature and moisture. Climate is taken to mean the average weather of a region over a long period of time. It is this phenomenon that man has had to consider in planning his mode of life to best adapt himself to the conditions of his environment. The average moisture, temperature, and wind conditions of a region largely determine the occupations of its inhabitants.	1913	1975.7288

the effect of different methods of circulating the air on the distribution of the candle power of tungsten lamps, and it has been found in several installations that by using reflectors with a restricted aperture a better distribution of the light is obtained than by using open reflectors, and in one instance where a series of lamps were tested with an open reflector and with a restricted reflector, it was found that the average candle power was 36 per cent, better with the restricted reflector. It seems, however, that to permit of this advantage being taken lamps should be designed to work with the restricted aperture reflectors, as there is a great difference in the distribution of the candle power of a lamp in an open reflector and in a restricted aperture reflector.	1912	1907.4397
"The scene was so animated and curious, the red coats, the blue and green of the sailors, the blue and grey of the constabulary, the confusion, the shouts, the threatening of the guards by the foreigners, the discharging of rifles, the wild galloping about of mounted men, the struggle of the steamers to get out, and the cheerful weather, made us forget we were in any danger. "" But we were, for suddenly a man who appeared to be an officer came up to us, and ordered us to come with him. We followed him across the beach towards the crowds, and were kept behind a barrier of soldiers, who pointed their rifles at us. Then, the officer went up to one of the foreigners, saluted him, and addressed him. The foreigner turned round and spoke to the officer, who then came up to us and said, in English, ' You are Englishmen ? ' "" ' Yes, ' I said, ' but we are not engaged in this business.' "" ' I am aware of that, ' he answered. ' I will protect you. You will come with me.' "" ' Where to ? ' I asked. "" ' To the post office, ' he replied.

"He had an eye to his interests and his vanity, and if a friend died he could give him a passing tribute of sincere regard. But his elegiac powers were very limited and his lyric ones none at all. The first few lines of one of his effusions will make this plain, and show the need of an editor to whom the whole would be ""an unlinked verse or fable."" Here is a specimen of his muse: "" To my friend Mr. HUGH KELLY, a few days before his death. "" O thou dear, sacred, ever honourd name !

"She was a pretty girl, and a little vain of her prettiness. She was smiling and talking to a young man. As she came near she saw Dave, and her face changed. She stopped and spoke to him. The young man scowled and moved on. ""What do you want to speak to me for?"" said Kate, sharply. ""I thought you were too good for a mill boy."" ""I am, and I ain't,"" he said, bitterly. ""I'm just what I am — a mill boy. And I hate the mill. I hate the work. I hate the pay. I hate everything about it. I never hated anything so in my life. I hate you."" ""You little sneak, you!"" she said. ""You told me you were going to school. You told me you were going to be a lawyer. You're just a common little mill boy. I hate you, too."" And she went on, tossing her head. The young man who had been with her was looking back, and his face was dark. Dave's hands clenched tightly under his ragged coat. He had lost her friendship, and he had lost his self respect. He was a mill boy, and he knew it. That night, as he lay in bed, he thought of the old days when he had been the pride of the school, when he had been the wonder of the debating club, when he had been the envy of the boys, when he had been the sweetheart of the prettiest girl in town."	1913	1941.07
"""(3) An)' stipulation made in contravention of the preceding sub-section shall be and be deemed to have been void"". The first clause of the Bill, which is of great importance, runs as follows : ""In this Act the expression 'local education authority' means the county council or the council of any borough or urban district, or the council of any county council and the council of any borough or urban district, having regard to the provisions of the Technical Instruction Acts, 1889 and 1891, and the expression 'public elementary school' has the same meaning as in the Elementary Education Act, 1870, except that it does not include any school ""provided by a school board in pursuance of the Elementary Education Act, 1891."" This clause defines what are to be regarded as local education authorities for the purposes of the Bill. They are to be the county councils, urban district councils, and borough councils, as well as the school boards, which are already local education authorities under the Elementary Education Act, 1870. This clause goes a long way towards removing the doubts as to the scope of the Bill by stating that the local authorities shall be those above mentioned, and that to them shall be entrusted the carrying out of the Bill. The second clause provides that the local authorities shall have the power to supply anything which may be required by way of instruction in the area which they represent."	1907	1890.3208

"" You're always a-worrying some one or other, Miss Skinner, and I'M never a minute in your company but I'M out of temper with you. And as for Theophilus Sprott, I'M not denying that he's a very good young man, and a very amiable young man, and a very inoffensive young man; but I don't see that that makes any difference. It isn't the amiability and inoffensiveness that I'M complaining of, but the other qualities that he shares with his amiability and inoffensiveness; and those are his self conceit, his obstinacy, and his canting."" "" Well, Mrs. Peppercorn, "" said Miss Skinner, "" if you are so very much annoyed with him, why don't you tell him so?"	1908	1888.4806
He did not think it would be necessary for him to draw attention to the salient points of the papers. Personally, he was rather in favour of the views of Mr. Goodenough as to the use of gas for direct illumination of printing works, although the point of view of Mr. Eck in recommending electricity would probably be adopted by the majority of the profession. He would ask the audience to bear in mind three things in connection with this subject. In the first place, the question of brightness was of great importance. The papers showed that cleanliness and maintenance were very important factors as far as brightness was concerned, but their importance was not yet fully realised by manufacturers. Secondly, the question of cost was of great importance. He had been astonished at the large cost of working and maintenance of the light produced by electricity and gas, as given in the papers. He had thought that the comparative cost of illuminating by gas and by electricity would have been found to be more in favour of electricity than the papers showed. Thirdly, there was the fact that in the majority of cases the employers of labour had to consider the health and comfort of their men, and it was probable that in the near future some form of electrical lighting would have to be adopted, as it was the only means which afforded a really healthy light.	1912	1903.1716
The Chicago fire cost, in round numbers, two hundred million dollars. The San Francisco fire has already cost four hundred million dollars, and we have not yet begun to figure. The Chicago fire destroyed about one fourth of the buildings in the city. The San Francisco fire has destroyed about three fourths of the buildings in the city. Chicago was rebuilt in four years, and was better built than before; San Francisco, if rebuilt, will not be rebuilt in less than ten years, and its rebuilding will not be as substantial as its former building. If the fire losses of the United States for this year are five hundred million dollars, what will be the effect upon our prosperity? The Chicago fire loss for that year raised the fire losses of the United States for that year to forty millions, but that was a trifling sum. The fire losses of the United States for this year will be five hundred millions, but that is still a trifling sum compared with the actual losses that will be sustained this year by reason of the San Francisco fire. The Chicago fire loss raised the losses for the United States for the following year to sixty millions, but that was still a trifling sum. The San Francisco fire will raise the fire losses of the United States for next year to one thousand millions, but that will be a trifling sum compared with the actual losses that will be sustained next year by reason of the San Francisco fire. If we should lose one thousand millions next year by fire, we should be thankful that we did not lose two thousand millions.	1907	1911.1285
"Let us see what they have given to the world in these subjects, or in the more modern subject of eugenics. It is hardly necessary to say that Darwin's Origin of Species is not a book about species merely. It takes up the whole field of biology and discusses every subject in it. ""It will be seen that I am treating the whole subject of biology, "" says Darwin in his preface. And the book is filled with discussions of the principles of geology, botany, and zoology. The title of the first chapter is ""Variation Under Domestication, "" and it is a discussion of the principles of animal husbandry. The second chapter is on ""Variation Under Nature, "" and is a discussion of the principles of forestry and agriculture. The third chapter is on ""Struggle for Existence, "" and is a discussion of the principles of political economy. The fourth chapter is on ""Natural Selection, "" and is a discussion of the principles of sociology. The fifth chapter is on ""Laws of Variation, "" and is a discussion of the principles of psychology. The sixth chapter is on ""Difficulties on Theory, "" and is a discussion of the principles of history, geology and astronomy.

"He has vetoed more obnoxious legislation than his predecessors combined, but he has also taken the responsibility of initiating legislation that was considered radical. He has not hesitated to uphold the law and the authority of the state against the threats of the labour leaders, and to take the side of the people and the public welfare against the selfish interests of all kinds that were opposed to the public good. He has clearly and definitely placed himself on record as against the so-called ""closed shop"" and for the ""open door"" of industrial liberty; and he has done more than this. He has not been misled by the sophistry of the leaders of labour unions in their attempts to disguise their real purposes in advocating the closed shop."	1911	1928.8416

The floor was of earth, the whitewashed walls were bare, and the windows were unglazed, but the sanctuary was the lavatory, and the clean pilgrims were glad to see the wooden basins and the water which had been brought up from the river. When we went out of the hostelry we stood aghast at the sight of the street. It was not a street, but a sea of mud, and the mud was not brown, but red. We walked about a little, and saw a few shops, and some more ikons. The ikons were in the window, and the shops were not very tempting, but there were many pilgrims who were buying. They were buying what did not seem to us at all necessary; they were buying boots! The muddy street was full of the shuffling boots of the pilgrims, and they were most of them falling to pieces.	1913	1892.556
We are living in an age of the exposure and punishment of graft. And that is the first sign of regeneration. The second sign is a new and vigorous spirit of civic pride and patriotism, which is being manifested in a hundred ways throughout the country. It is this spirit which has put an end to many a disgraceful city government, and is now engaged in the work of reforming others. Let me give you an illustration. I have recently seen a statement that the average annual cost of maintaining a public library in the United States is $1.04 for each person in the community served. In Boston it is $1.86; in Cleveland, $2.20; in Chicago, $2.74; in San Francisco, $2.87; and in Denver, $3.50. And just because Denver spends that much money for her public library, there are people in Denver who are trying to discredit the library. Yet what a splendid opportunity is afforded this remarkable city for the manifestation of civic pride and patriotism! In the face of such a statement as I have just read, is it possible to believe that the citizens of Denver are less patriotic than those of Chicago or San Francisco? I venture the assertion that, although the amount each citizen of Denver pays for library purposes is nearly three times that of the average citizen of the United States, he gets more for his money than his fellow citizens get in Chicago or San Francisco.	1911	1911.1212
With this cabinet the student may make his selection of background, and when the lights and the arrangement of the subject are adjusted for the most pleasing pictorial effect, the flash is set, and by pushing the button a study of the subject in a flash of a second is made. With this method the flash is taken as a secondary process and the operator is enabled to have the lights in position before making the flash. While similar to an electric lantern cabinet, this method has many advantages, as the operator can light and focus the same as with a single slant light. The flash is adjustable to the distance of the subject when making the study. The battery ignition is the only practical ignition for this kind of work, and the cabinet is so arranged that the battery may be changed in a moment, giving the operator an unlimited number of flashes without recharging.	1912	1913.4601

required, however, was plotted by the formula — HP. required = — — (1) 33,000 where V = speed in feet per second. 11. The gliding angle was calculated from the formula — Weight gliding angle = (2) Resistance where the weight and resistance are expressed in the same units. The curve of HP. available was constructed from the known formula — HP. available = TS. x Velocity (3) 33,000 where TS. = thrust in pounds. 12. The thrust was calculated from the propeller thrust coefficient, which was assumed to be .5. This coefficient appears to be the lowest value which can be employed in practice, and the thrust is generally much higher (see paragraph 35). 13. In estimating the area of the propeller, it was assumed, on the advice of Mr. McCormack, that the diameter was 4 times the chord length.	1912	1961.1934
The children read these things, and perhaps the sight of a summer visitor's bankbook gives them some inkling of the idea of saving. But the old folks remain as they were, and it is to them that the summer visitor must pay his tribute of sympathy. There is no one so touchingly patient as old Sam Blanchard. He is one of the two or three oldest men on the island. He is at least ninety-five years old, for he was born on the island in 1817. He is almost blind and has not much more than a shred of hearing. When he is in his chair on the street he cannot recognise even his oldest friends. His memory seems to be that of a child of five, for his talk is of things which occurred before the Civil War. He never mentions his children or grandchildren, and they never visit him. He lives, or rather vegetates, with one of his daughters, a woman of sixty, who is presumably his only child left to him. He is simply a remnant of the past, and the sunlight is the only thing that can cheer his life of inactivity. His nearest neighbour is another old man, James Parker, who must be at least eighty-eight. He has a fine memory, and one warms to him at once. He is the historian of the island.	1913	1906.518
"The bream or white fish of these parts is a close relative of the sea bream of England, and its flesh is quite as delicate and delicious. Add to these a few lines about the tortoise, the salamander, and the golden mole, and the picture is complete. 45  CHAPTER VIII A VILLAGE LIFE ON THE BORDER "" A VISIT to the missions, "" said S. Philip, the Deacon, in the earliest days of the Church, "" is the crown of all the labours in which we can engage."" And a visit to the East Cape Missions is certainly not the least pleasant form of work which can fall to the lot of a priest. It affords a good opportunity for getting to know well the native people, who are, alas, too often only looked upon as a secondary charge to whites, and it is not only a brilliant educational experience for the visitor, but also a valuable source of inspiration and information for the Church at Home. To be thoroughly comfortable, it is best to make these round of visits during the summer months when the weather is fine and sunny. The best plan is to form a little party, so as to make one's self sure of the irregular conveyance of a ' cart or wagon, ' and a good driver or drivers. A ' cart, ' you must know, is a wooden box about as big as a dog kennel, upon two strong axles about four feet apart, and between the wheels about two feet high."	1908	1884.016
"For instance, take a simple explanation of a "" meadow "" or "" prairie."" In Massachusetts every child has probably seen several stretches of land overgrown with grass whose size would permit him to use the word "" meadow "" in the proper way; but imagine a boy from that same Massachusetts talking to a boy at 28 Barrow about a meadow. To the boy from Barrow the word is probably (until explained) a word without a meaning. There is no place near Barrow where there is a piece of ground large enough to entitle it to be called by that name. I spoke of these things to Mr. Hawkesworth, asking him how he explained a contradiction of this sort; and he said he tried hard to show the boys that there was a time when the writer of their book had seen but one thing, and that one thing was the meadow of which he was speaking, and that even after he had seen many things, the meadow was always in his mind the most important; and there was nothing in the book which he was sure his pupils new as well as their teacher."	1913	1923.2885
The last chapter is a very complete treatment of the subject of testing, and may be read with advantage by British electricians, though some of the methods described in it would hardly be acceptable under the I. E. regulations. The book concludes with a series of tables, giving the resistances of different sections of copper and iron wires, and a large number of formulce for calculating the resistance of wires of different lengths, and for calculating the maximum number of lamps which can be supplied by a given wire. The book is brought out as a text book for the use of German schools of electrical instruction, and it is to be hoped that it may be equally well received in this country. The present volume is mainly devoted to the consideration of the properties of radiant energy, and of the methods of measuring it. The book is divided into five parts, dealing respectively with (i) the general properties of light, (ii) photometry, (iii) the spectrum and colour, (iv) optics and the theory of vision, and (v) the properties of non luminous radiant energy. Each part concludes with a series of experiments, and the book is provided with a large number of references to the original literature. The first part of the book is occupied with a consideration of the old and new ideas on the nature of light, and the experimental proof of the undulatory or corpuscular theory of light.	1912	1882.9983
given the date of the Cross as shortly before or shortly after igoo a. d. , and he derives it from Saxony. If now we turn to the inscriptions, we find three in character, Latin, Greek, and Runic. First, as to the Latin.1 There are considerable difficulties in identifying the inscriptions. They are not given in full in the only two descriptions which we have, those of Wilson and of John Henry Parker, and Parker's is most unsatisfactory ; while the drawings 1 Prof. Skeat gives the inscriptions on the Latin side as : — (i) In a small circle above the feet : 'PAX VOBIS. — (2) In an arc above : SSMARIA.

But there are a few things to remember in using flash powder. One is that the quality of the light is not good, the burnt magnesium gives a bluish tinge to the light. Another is that the time of the exposure should be long enough to allow the powder to burn out. If the exposure is shorter than this, the face will be overexposed, while the dress, which is farther from the light, will be underexposed. If the exposure is long enough to allow the powder to burn out, the light is then falling on the subject from only one side, and it has changed to an ordinary incandescent light, which is not good for portraiture. The method of using flash light is as follows: 1. Place the magnesium in the holder, after having mixed it with the benzine, and set this in position on the floor or on a chair, so that it will be at the proper angle to the subject. 2. Set the camera, and focus it. 3. Pull the string to ignite the powder, and press the button. After the powder has exploded, remove the holder from the floor. If one follows these directions carefully, he will get good results. But it is not absolutely necessary to focus and set the camera before igniting the powder, for the explosion will not take place until the shutter is open.	1912	1920.3761
", a velocity of 840 ft./sec. would be required, which is not beyond the limits of possibility for a stream of air. Under these circumstances the loss of hp. due to cooling would be only - 1 5 of the total hp. of the motor, which is not excessive. The question of air cooling is, however, one that is not yet fully worked out. It is very difficult to obtain reliable data on the subject, and it is probable that the hp. loss due to cooling is much greater than the above calculations would indicate. Even if the above calculations are correct, the loss of - 1 5 hp. per hp. is a serious matter. It is equivalent to having to provide a motor of 60 hp. to obtain 50 net hp. available for doing work. 1 The figures given in this paragraph have been calculated from data given by Professor H. A. Kramers in a paper on ""Air Cooling of Gas Engines, "" published in The Electrical World and Engineer for April 20, 1907."	1912	1900.7921

The one nearest me, who was older than her adversary, was sweeping out her apartment, and in some way the younger was at the moment passing through the door of the broom, which, as she protested, was very rude. With a great deal of spirit the younger maintained her position, and with a great deal of spirit the elder maintained hers, and as the gallery was not wide, the one swept toward the other, and the other steadily blocked the passage of the broom. The affair had much of the character of a duel, and the intensity of the combatants was increased by the fact that it was being watched by several others of the house who were leaning over the balustrades of the lower gallery. The ladies were both young and good looking, and the scene was animated.	1913	1887.414
THE PLANETS. 207 208 When we arrived, we found that the banquet was to be held in the great domed hall, the roof of which was painted to represent the heavens, the various signs of the zodiac being represented by mythological figures, while the constellations, the planets, and the sun and moon were all shown in their respective positions. As we entered, we were met by Soranho and several of the councillors, and escorted to our places at the head of the table, Soranho occupying the seat immediately on our right, and Merna that on our left. When we had all taken our seats, the president of the council, who sat at the foot of the table, called for silence, and delivered a short address of welcome, which was followed by a speech from Soranho, and then by a series of toasts.	1911	1884.2432
To my mind the best results are obtained by the glow lamp, and when the glow lamp is perfectly manufactured, and can in every case be used, I should be pleased to use nothing else. Personally, I despair of the incandescent gas lamp being substantially improved. When or if we can have absolutely perfect glow lamps, it is my wish to use nothing else. It seems to me that when they are manufactured all faultily made lamps will disappear. The glow lamp gives the highest intensity of illumination, and the light of any one lamp can be concentrated by means of shades and reflectors into 020 very small solid angle, so that we can effect great reductions in the number of lamps required to illuminate any area. At the same time the lamps are pleasing to the eye when glowing, and do not offend artistic taste. The only objection to glow lamps is their present short life, but this, as I have said, I hope will be overcome, and they will be regularly manufactured to last at least five hundred hours. On entering any building where a large area is illuminated by numbers of gas incandescent lamps, one cannot help but remark the disagreeable aspect which it presents, owing to the great differences in the lamps. where the object required is not to obtain the maximum illumination, but to make a medium area of illumination, the glow lamp has the still further advantage that the number of lamps may be reduced to one-half or less by the use of a rheostat.	1912	1877.5365
"""Yes, "" said the young man with the fair moustache, ""but I fancy that you haven't got the power, have you?"" The old gentleman glared at him, and then turned to me. ""You said just now, "" he went on, ""that you were a lawyer. In that case, it's very likely that you sympathise with those fellows whom I have just denounced. But I don't mean to let you off so easily. The whole of the present state of society is rotten to the core, and the law is the chief instrument of oppression. The lawyers, who ought to be the first to rise against it, are the very first to uphold it."" ""Well, "" said the young man with the fair moustache, ""that is a very strong indictment. But I think that I can see a flaw in it."" ""Oh, there is a flaw in everything, "" said the old gentleman. ""I'm not going to argue with you. I'm simply going to state my views."" ""But I think that I can see a flaw in your views, "" said the young man. ""It seems to me that you are rather mixing up the lawyer with the law. The law is not the creation of the lawyer. The lawyer has practically nothing to do with it. The law is made by the Legislature, and the Legislature is composed of the representative men of the country. The law, therefore, is the creation of the people."" ""What then?"" asked the old gentleman, sulkily. ""Well, then, I should say that the lawyer, instead of being the first to uphold the law, is, on the contrary, the first to rise against it."	1913	1894.757
"We might ask whether the mental activities, the functions, can be improved, developed, trained, by experimental methods. This is the problem of mental hygiene, a problem which is now being attacked from many sides by experimental psychology. When we speak of the training of the various mental functions we have in mind the old principle of the school: "" What is learned well is learned for all time."" The school has always tried to teach the pupil to think and to remember, not only the special things which he is learning at the moment, but also the things which he will learn later on. The school has tried to make the pupil's attention span wider and more enduring, so that he will be able to act on a larger and more complicated environment."	1909	1962.9313
A man is not relieved from his pecuniary liability because he has made an erroneous calculation, unless the other party has led him into the error by some fraud or misrepresentation.3 An agreement to convey real estate “subject to all oil leases and tanks now upon the premises” was held enforceable as a contract to convey, notwithstanding it was claimed that, in view of the erroneous estimate on the part of both parties as to the number and value of the tanks on the premises, the contract could not be enforced. ‘ A broker was employed to sell a lot at a price of a thousand dollars. He wrote a prospective buyer that it was for sale at one thousand dollars, and he, “the owner,” would take eight hundred for it.	1913	1907.0814
"All the most eminent authorities on the science of nutrition agree on this point. This is the testimony of the very representatives of the medical profession who have been denounced as "" prejudiced, ignorant and fanatical."" The vegetarian diet need not in all cases be a simple diet in the culinary sense of the term. It may consist of a great variety of dishes skillfully prepared. As a matter of fact a vegetarian diet in the culinary sense is a very difficult diet to prepare, owing to the limited variety of foods of vegetable origin that are considered permissible by many vegetarians. If the vegetarian be a fruitarian, the preparation is very simple. He need only peel his bananas and eat them. A fruitarian diet is the simplest of all diets. But it is not the most palatable. It is not the most easily digested, and it is not the most conducive to health. For these reasons it is not recommended by the advocates of a vegetarian diet, as it is not recommended by the advocates of a mixed diet. The most important point to be considered is: Is the vegetarian diet the most healthful and conducive to the highest degree of well being? In answer to this question we again appeal to the science of nutrition. A well selected and properly prepared vegetarian diet is not only capable of sustaining the highest standards of growth, health, endurance and longevity, it is the most healthful diet known."	1911	1936.8674
"It is to be hoped that, when this work is completed, the new Council will turn its attention to the matter of street names. A few are English, a few Dutch, but the majority are native. The chief thoroughfare is known as the ""Kaffir Street."" The principal hotel is in ""Mafeking Road."" A street leading to the cemetery is ""Bumali Street."" The name of the town itself is a native word, ""Mafeking,"" meaning ""place of the wind."" The natives are now resident in a new location. The street names are a relic of the period when the place was a mere native kraal. They are a reproach to any civilised community. The town is now governed by a Council elected by the inhabitants. The first Council was nominated by Lord Milner. How excellent was its composition is testified by the work done, and by the fact that when its term of office ceased nearly all the members were reelected. The trams are now its property. The Council has been fortunate in securing as Town Clerk Mr. Fuller Lance, who was the Town Clerk of Johannesburg and had resigned that post in order to come to Mafeking. He is a man of exceptional ability, and has proved himself a most valuable acquisition. The town is now governed by a Council elected by the inhabitants."	1908	1921.6913
"It was a chill, fresh morning, with mists still lying on the broad lowlands far away, and a crisp wind blowing from the sea. The rose trees were bare, the fountain dry, the statues draped in their winter coverings. A gardener, with a wheelbarrow, and a woman in a white apron, were working in a flower bed. As he passed, he recognised her as Madame Adam. ""What, are you here already?"" he said, stopping. ""I was told I should find you in Paris, "" she answered, smiling. ""But I was so tired after my journey from Hoddon Grey that I slept at once at Coryston. I am very well, and am going to begin work at once. But I never expected to find this beautiful place."" ""Oh, it's a beautiful place, "" he said, impatiently. ""But it has to be inherited and looked after, and that is a bore. I wonder if you will have time to call on Lady Coryston, or whether she will let you in? She is a very peculiar person."" ""I shall be at her service, whenever I am called upon, "" replied Madame Adam, simply. But he noticed that she did not seem to relish the suggestion, and he was glad. He did not want her to like that woman. ""She is a great friend of Lord Eric's, "" he said, ""and she is very fond of strange people, so I think you will please her."""	1913	1940.7135
The definition of the lunar outline is so exact that the outline of the would-be intervening atmosphere is equally exact and is plainly visible. There is no such atmosphere, either in the case of the Moon generally or of the individual mountains and walled plains that have been observed 74 at occultation. The absence of atmospheric effects at the lunar sunrise and sunset has been described on page 38. Further evidence of the absence of atmosphere and of magnetic field is found in the fact that the Moon is not a rotating magnet. This is shown by the experiment which is described on pages 120-121. Moreover, in the absence of an atmosphere there can be no weathering of the surface. It has already been pointed out on page 63 that those luminous streaks which cross the surfaces of many of the ring mountains are not due to an absence of weathering, for they are not bright in the moonlight.	1913	1943.1675
"The five Queen Elizabeths had been signalled to close on the enemy's main body, and, followed by the Inflexible, Lion, and Tiger, they tore ahead, leaving the seven Dreadnoughts to guard the rear. The leap forward of the British Fleet had been a revelation to the Germans, who had thought the British No. 1 Light Cruiser a battleship, and were surprised to note the destruction of so many "" battleships."" From the moment the British opened fire they had concentrated on the Queen Elizabeths, and the magnitude of the German bombardment of the Queen Elizabeths had astonished the British. But with the Queen Elizabeths, the Inflexible, and the first three Dreadnoughts rushing to the attack, there was no time for further consideration. The move to cut the British line was disconcerting and added to the severity of the German fire, but the British seemed to have lost none of their old time precision and steadiness under fire."	1906	1910.1265
During the twelve months ended September 30th in that year, 67 tramway servants were killed and 387 injured, the proportion of killed to injured being about one to six. This compares unfavourably with the previous year, when 55 were killed and 325 injured, the proportion of killed to injured being one to five ; but the average annual rate of casualties per 1,000 men is still slightly better than that of railway servants in 1904. (A comparative table of year by year results in this connection is appended to the Annual Summary.) The principal division of tramway casualties, as in the case of railways, is that into acci 54 dents to passengers and to servants — in the former class 38 tramway men were killed and 263 injured during the year; in the latter, 29 were killed and 124 injured.	1907	1899.8539
The required visibility for air navigation is very much greater than for boat navigation. It is not enough that the pilot have a clear view of the course ahead; he must be able to see the terrain surrounding the course for several miles in order to be able to determine his position accurately. 23. The foregoing discussion indicates that the required visibility for efficient navigation is a function of the size of the craft, its speed, the speed with which it can be brought to rest, the manoeuvrability of the craft, and the density of the traffic. These factors vary for different types of navigation. In the case of air navigation, the required visibility is also a function of the number and size of obstructions and the average density of the traffic.	1913	1942.3939
Use dark corners in large rooms to produce the effect of contrast and to relieve the monotony of even lighting. (2) That shadows are essential to relief in a room. (3) That the number of sources of light should be kept to a minimum, in order to simplify the control of the illumination. (4) That no one piece of furniture should be the centre of attraction, either as to position or illumination. All furniture should be so arranged as to be individual parts of the whole decorative scheme. (5) That the light should be such as to make objects apparently near to appear to be actually near to the observer. The fallacy of the so-called focal centre illustrates the necessity of making the source of illumination the least conspicuous object in the room.	1912	1912.1896

"- The forecaster is warned to beware of false alarms of fog in the case of the San Francisco area. The cold bay water keeps temperatures and dewpoints rather low, and slight rises in surface dewpoint and temperature from the ocean inland are rather common. However, when the air travels only a short distance inland, the increased moisture from land (the dewpoint rises) and the increased temperature (the temperature also rises) both combine to ""cause a greater spread (difference between temperature and dewpoint) and thus a less likelihood of fog or low clouds. On the other hand, the forecaster for such a region as the Alabama and northwest Florida panhandle areas, where the air moves very short distances (due to the weak and variable winds) and where the surface dewpoints and temperatures are usually high, will have to be on the alert for just such cases as described in the previous paragraph relative to the California area."	1913	1960.4462
"In his ""Principles of Rural Economics, "" Professor Carver shows the operation of the law of diminishing returns on the farm, and he is careful to point out that it is only within the limits of intensive farming that this law operates. He says, ""The conclusion is that the law of diminishing returns in its general form does not apply to the normal farming of the United States. It applies only to that farming which is carried on under the compulsion of high prices and the necessity of making a living, to the farming of the man who has only a few acres and must make the most of them.""

There is, however, something to be said in favour of competitive examinations for the selection of students who are to be admitted to a college. If, for example, a college is limited to three hundred students, and if each year it has to select three hundred out of five hundred candidates, it is evident that the selection must be made by some method. If it is made by competitive examinations, and if the selection is made solely from the grades of these competitive examinations, it will be found that the selected students will be not only as good as those selected by personal interviews, but they will be better, for the reason that in the case of a large college it is impossible for the professors to know all the students personally, and there is always a certain element of personal liking and disliking that enters into the selection.	1911	1887.7465
"They are practically doomed to extinction. The colour problem in Australia is that presented by the influx of Asiatics, especially the Chinese. The Chinese were the first serious threat to the white man in Australia, and the danger was especially serious in the early years of the commonwealth. In 1901, the first year of the commonwealth, the Australian parliament passed an immigration act aimed directly at the Chinese. This act was supplemented in 1902 by a customs act which introduced the much abused "" dictation test."" This test is applied to every immigrant of colour. It consists of the requirement that the immigrant shall write out, in any one of the languages of the British Empire, fifty words dictated to him by the immigration officer. It is only in recent years that the unwelcome immigrant has been able to evade this test by passing through Japan, the only coloured country with which Australia is on friendly and equal terms."	1911	1944.1752
I. I said that the teacher's work is creative work. I do not mean that he does a new work, that he recreates science, that he forms a new language or makes new laws. But he is a creator in the sense that he produces a new being in the act of teaching. He makes his pupil understand and feel, his pupil grows conscious of the world outside of him, and he begins to live a double life, an inner and an outer life. But this new being, this pupil, cannot be produced without effort on the part of the teacher, and the responsibility rests with the teacher as to the kind and quality of the being which he produces.  The teacher's work is called an art, and the term expresses very well the creative character of the work. In every art the artist creates a new thing, and the new thing is the outcome of his will and effort. But the new thing has also a certain form and shape determined by the artist. In the nature of the thing the artist's personality has to take a definite and proportionate part in the creation. The artist makes his work take shape according to his own view of the world and of life. It is more than a mere coincidence that artists in every branch of artistic work are subject to certain laws that govern their work. The painter has his laws; the musician follows laws that govern the development of every theme throughout the different parts of a composition; moulding laws govern the shape and the size of every part of the architect's building.	1909	1917.8871

"But the glance which met the glance that was challenged was straight and bright, and did not flinch. Lady Coryston, after a second's pause, smiled. ""I am going to like you!"" she said, with a little lift of her chin. ""I have heard about you from my husband."" ""From your husband?"" Enid hesitated, and a startled look appeared for an instant in her eyes. ""What has he told you?"" ""He has told me that you are a very able woman, and that you have been an honour to your profession."" Enid smiled at her in turn. It was a smile which made the irregular features in no wise less striking — rather more so. ""I am flattered, "" she said lightly. ""I suppose Mr. Coryston is a little classical scholar, like his father."" ""He is a great deal more than that, "" said Lady Coryston, proudly. ""He is a very clever and promising young man. But he has to fight for his place, and we are all helping him. When one is of gentle birth, and has a title to one's name, the world is ready to be good to one.""

At any rate, whatever the future may have in store, there can be no doubt of the importance of the problem of the relations of the white and yellow races on the Pacific Coast. We have seen that the white population of the Pacific States is growing rapidly. Less than 20 per cent of the land is in farms, and the value of the farm land is increasing much faster than the general average. The increase of density of population in these states, even allowing for a large influx of immigrants, will be much greater than the average for the country at large. And if the percentage of the land in farms reaches that of the country at large, a density of population of 270 persons to the square mile will be attained.	1911	1934.1805
Mendicancy is utterly suppressed. Even the drift of agricultural labourers to the cities has ceased. Instead, there is a constant stream of young men returning from the cities to their father's farms, which they find better equipped and stocked than ever before, and to which they can go with the accumulated savings of their apprentice years. In the next section we shall discuss the conditions which have brought about this splendid economic revival in the land of Friedrich list. 45 s CHAPTER XXVI THE LAND OF FRIEDRICH LIST 946 As we move toward the Rhine we pass from the agricultural section of Prussia into the industrial, and, as we shall see later, from the agricultural to the industrial state. But no line of demarcation separates the two sections. Agriculture is everywhere in Germany being more and more closely allied to industry. The two are closely interrelated. Industrial conditions affect agriculture, and agricultural conditions affect industry. This is especially true in the case of the Rhine province. In its mingling of agriculture and industry that province illustrates the new Germany. In all Europe it is the best illustration of the close interdependence between the two. For this reason, if for no other, it deserves a special study. Fortunately, this is made easy by the fact that the Rhine province is the most typical part of Germany. It is the part that presents, in most condensed form, 947 German characteristics. It is in many respects the centre, both physically and politically, of the empire. In the narrowest sense, the province owes its existence to the policy of Napoleon.	1913	1903.27
They were not so much interested in the results of the investigations as in the investigations themselves. They wanted to know how the scientists had discovered these things, what methods they had used, what the difficulties were and how they had been overcome. A story of scientific adventure was always interesting. They did not care to read the dry descriptions of the work of the scientist, but they were quite willing to read the story of the man who had made the investigation, if it was a good story. They cared little for the results of the investigation, but they were intensely interested in the methods used in the investigation. This is the reason why the boys were so interested in the work of the American Anthropological Society, for the work of this society is largely a fight against the obstacles to the investigation of primitive man.	1911	1929.448
"To her, the most ludicrous things were a serious matter. The Captain's earnestness appealed to her, and she turned and looked at him again with the same lift of the head. But this time she did not turn away again. She put her left hand on the edge of the opposite seat, leaned forward, and looked at him for some moments in silence. ""Then, "" she said at last, "" you are not a gentleman?"" ""I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with you, "" he answered with some bitterness. ""I cannot at present afford the title."" She turned away, and sat down again at the further end of the compartment, half concealed by the curtain. Then, tired of his reflections, and anxious to learn more about this girl, to whose manner he felt he must make some sort of reply, he strolled down the compartment, and leaned against the arm of her seat, and looked down at her."	1913	1899.7592
And we were not alone. That was the worst of all. We had with us a man who had gone mad — a man who had been a hero, a man who had saved my life in the time of the wreck, and who had been a faithful and devoted servant ever since. He had been struck on the head by a falling spar, and he had recovered his senses only to lose them. He was no longer Nils; he was the ' White Sea Devil, ' and he raved about like a wild beast. I was no longer fit to be with men, and Dagmar was no longer fit to be with women, so we took refuge together in that boat, and God! how we prayed. The Devil raged in Nils, but God triumphed over the Devil.	1908	1908.2683
The average life of these lamps on the London Underground Electric Railways is over 1,500 hours. The best results, however, have been obtained with the B.T.H. lamps on the Birmingham Corporation Tramways. These lamps were introduced for the first time on this system in October, 1910, and up to the end of July, 1911, over 400,000 hours' burning had been obtained from them at an average life of over 2,000 hours, and a maximum of 3,000 hours. The success of the B.T.H. Mazda lamps on the Birmingham Tramways is probably due in no small measure to the care and attention which Mr. Dunn, the electrician in charge, has bestowed on the fitting up and maintenance of the lamps. He has always insisted on the utmost cleanliness in connection with the lamps and their fittings, and has never tired of impressing on the workmen the importance of this detail. This is a matter which cannot be too strongly insisted on, for, as already pointed out, the presence of dirt or moisture, or the slightest imperfection in the fitting of a lamp, may lead to premature failure. It is also of the greatest importance that the lamps should be thoroughly well ventilated, and that they should never be allowed to get overheated. If the hood or visor of a lamp is made too tight, or if the lamp has to be placed in a position where it cannot get the necessary ventilation, it will be found that the life of the lamp will be very materially shortened.	1912	1919.5171
A good story is going the rounds about the arrival of the Cormorant at Milford. As the Cormorant steamed slowly into the harbour, the townspeople were much puzzled to see her flying the German flag. It is said that the German flag was hoisted as a ruse to deceive any lurking submarines, and that the real British ensign was not run up until the ship was safely at anchor. The Cormorant was towed into Milford Haven by a British destroyer, and was met by a number of tugs, which took her in charge. She was flying the German flag, and a number of German prisoners were on board. The prisoners were taken off at the entrance to the Haven, and were escorted to Pembroke Dock by a file of marines. The Cormorant was then brought up to Milford by a British destroyer and a number of tugs, and was met by a crowd of excited spectators. The crew of the Cormorant were all Germans, and the number of prisoners was about 120. The Cormorant was a ship of about 2000 tons, and was a training ship for the German navy. She was fitted with only one gun, and her speed was about 12 knots. She was captured in the South Atlantic by the British cruiser Glasgow, and was sunk by the British crew, who then took the German prisoners on board the Glasgow.	1906	1904.3678
"This is a timid admission, in the face of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, of what I have already said, that the rule of apportionment is not, and cannot be, a feasible permanent standard. The best they can say is that it is not so grossly unfair and impracticable as the rule of uniformity. They admit that the rule of uniformity is more grossly unfair and impracticable than the rule of apportionment. I ask the reader to mark the significance of this admission. The Bill to which these gentlemen are trying to lend the weight of their names, and upon which they are attempting to manufacture public sentiment, for the purpose of foisting it on the Legislature, is an income tax Bill, levying a tax on incomes from property as well as on incomes from labour, by the rule of uniformity, not by the rule of apportionment. 27 The authors of the Bill attempt to deceive the unsuspecting by calling their tax a "" graduated tax on incomes."""	1911	1880.3209
This Bill was subsequently altered and republished as Bill 265 (see below). 3. Asquith (Mr.) Education (England and Wales) Bill (No. 265). — This Bill follows closely the provisions of the Education Clauses of the preceding Bill, with the following changes : — (a) The closing of the public house, on the premises of which a school is to be built is to be carried out by the local authority instead of the school authority (clause 7). (b) The taker of the public house, the license of which is to be purchased, is to be compensated for loss of goodwill and otherwise to such amount as the two authorities may agree (sub clause 2). (c) The mode of ascertaining the value of premises, on the purchase of which compulsory powers are to be exercised, is to be determined by arbitration instead of by agreement as in clause 8 of the former Bill (clause 8). (d) The duties with respect to schools imposed on local authorities and on the Board of Education are to cease at the end of five years from the appointed day instead of at the end of three years as in the former Bill (clause 9). (e) The duties of the local authority with respect to the maintenance of voluntary schools are omitted. (f) The clauses providing for the establishment of a Council for Wales are omitted.	1907	1902.9872
This quince was imported from France, and in recent years other varieties of quince which are very desirable for this purpose have been introduced. The pear is also occasionally worked on our native wild pear stock or on the Pyrus longipes, but as these stocks are not readily available they are of little importance. Training the young pear tree. Pears are generally grown in the nursery in the same way as are apples. They should be well pruned when they are set out in the nursery, and the pruning should be repeated every year. In fact, pears require more careful and more continuous pruning than do apples, and the reason for this is because the young pear trees are more averse to making new growths than are young apple trees.	1914	1892.9489
"It is also a matter of some difficulty to find the right expression to use in conversing with people whose relationships to each other are different when they are under discussion. Thus, let us suppose that John has a brother James, who is the child we are supposed to be talking about. The child speaks of James to John as "" your brother, "" meaning that he is the brother of the person to whom he is speaking, and he refers to James as "" my uncle, "" meaning that James is the uncle of the child, that is, the brother of the child's father or mother. When John and the child are speaking of James to Mary, John's wife, the child speaks of James as "" your brother, "" meaning now Mary's brother, and refers to James as "" my uncle, "" meaning now that James is the uncle of the child through the mother, that is, the brother of the child's mother."	1913	1911.4291
They are determined by the amount of moisture present in the lower part of the troposphere, and the strength of the wind aloft. The latter will determine the height to which the cloud will grow, and also the lateral dimensions, since a strong wind will carry away the moisture as fast as it is delivered by the updrafts. In such cases, the cross section of the updraft will be small, and the lateral dimensions of the cloud small. On the other hand, if the moisture is abundant, and the wind aloft weak, the cross section of the updraft will be large, and the lateral dimensions of the cloud large. Figure 51 shows an example of the former, and figure 52 of the latter case. The Cumulonimbus will grow to the tropopause, and then level off to form an anvil. This is due to the fact that the temperature at the tropopause is lower than that of the cloud top, and the cumulus top is therefore in a stable layer. The anvil is a stratus or cirrostratus. It has been stated that the Cumulonimbus is the thunder cloud. This is true in a general way, but thunderstorms may occur with clouds of less vertical extent, and without any nimbus cloud being present on the sky.	1913	1888.7462
(b) Varieties of limited vigour and productiveness, very sensitive to bad conditions and adapted only for restricted localities. It is generally safe to plant the first class of varieties, while the second class must be planted with great care and after thorough study of the subject. QUANTITY AND COST OF TREES AND PLANTS. Fruit trees and plants have a wide range in price according to size, age, and variety. Under ordinary market conditions, we may expect to pay from 8 to 10 dollars for 100 apple trees, about $12 for 100 pear trees, from $2 to $10 for 100 peach trees, from $10 to $50 for 100 grape vines, and $10 to $20 for 100 strawberry plants. Prices vary according to the season, quality, and especially according to the manner in which the trees or plants are packed and shipped. In buying trees or plants, it is very important to see that they are packed properly. The trees or plants should not be frozen or dried out, as, when they reach the fruit grower's place, they are likely to be dead. The best way for the fruit grower to buy nursery stock is to visit the nursery and see the trees or plants growing in the nursery row. In this way, he can avoid poor stock, which is sometimes very expensive, although it is sold at a low price. If the grower has no opportunity to visit the nursery, he should buy his stock from some well known reliable firm with a good reputation.	1914	1935.0715
A series of special reports on each of the three divisions of West Ham, submitted to the Local Committee of the British Red Cross Society as a basis for their work during the War. It would have been easy to infuse a depressing note into a work of this kind, but the authors have striven to present the facts in a sympathetic spirit, being convinced that the problem of poverty is not one of hopeless immorality. The first part of this book gives a brief sketch of the history and topography of the borough, and of its industries and population. The second and larger part consists of fifteen appendices, devoted to such subjects as housing, health, education, delinquency, emancipation from poor law relief, women's work, the unemployed, and voluntary associations.	1908	1898.1077

The cultivation of these crops makes it possible for the trees to make a good growth of wood and it also keeps the soil in good physical condition. The cultivation and the removal of the crop from the orchard make it necessary to plant the trees farther apart than if no crops were grown. The distance apart must be determined by the crop grown and the kind of tree. In general, the distance apart should be about as follows: Apples, 30 feet apart; peaches, 20 feet; pears, 25 feet; plums, 20 feet; cherries, 20 feet; blackberries, 6 feet; raspberries, 6 feet; strawberries, 4 feet. In a ten year old orchard of apples planted 30 feet apart, there would be room for a row of raspberries between the apple rows. If the apples were 25 feet apart, there would be room for a row of blackberries. If the apples were 20 feet apart, there would be room for a row of potatoes or corn. If the cherries were 20 feet apart, there would be room for a row of strawberries. If the peaches were 15 feet apart, there would be room for a row of potatoes or corn. The actual distance apart must be determined by the amount of light and moisture in the orchard, the kind of tree and the crop grown.	1914	1930.4968
The flesh of the mountain sheep was the only food of which such detailed prohibitions were found among the Eskimos of the Kobuk region; but among the Eskimos of the lower Yukon and Koyukuk, among the Koyukon Indians, and still further south among the Tanana Indians, there are found detailed prohibitions concerning the eating of many other animals and birds. These prohibitions, however, are not nearly as strict as those concerning the mountain sheep among the Kobuk Eskimos. They apply chiefly to the flesh of the bear, the moose, the goat, and the ptarmigan. Among the Kobuk Eskimos the flesh of the ptarmigan was taboo to women who had not yet undergone the first menstruation. Among the Koyukon Indians it was taboo to all women, both old and young, who had not yet had their first child. The flesh of the moose was taboo to women who had not yet had their first child among the Kobuk Eskimos, and among the Koyukon Indians it was taboo to women who had not yet had their first menstruation. The flesh of the goat was taboo to women who had not yet had their first child among the Kobuk Eskimos, and among the Tanana Indians it was taboo to women who had not yet had their first menstruation. The flesh of the bear was taboo to women who had not yet had their first child among the Kobuk Eskimos, and among the Tanana Indians it was taboo to all women, both old and young, who had not yet had their first child.	1913	1893.3612
This opera was performed only four times and abandoned, probably because Beard's voice had grown weak, or because assiduous study of Shakespeare had led Garrick to regret the liberties he had taken. In 1758 appeared — The Tempest, or the Enchanted Island, a musical entertainment in three acts, the music by Thomas Arne. The text, compiled by Arne, includes nothing of Shakespeare's, but gives an adaptation, after Dryden, of Philip King's pastoral drama of 1703, The Enchanted Island, as well as of several episodes from Fletcher's Sea Voyage, The Island Princess, and other romances. This version was played at Drury Lane, October 1, 1758, and was given forty times in the course of the season, with such success as to provoke three pirated imitations — The Tempest, or the Enchanted Island, by John Hoadley, and two other adaptations by Francis Godolphin Waldron and by Henry Winstanley. In 1767, when Arne's version had lost its popularity, was produced — The Tempest, an entertainment in one act, compiled by Hoadley and played at Covent Garden. In 1768 — The Tempest, a musical entertainment in two acts, compiled by Winstanley and presented at Drury Lane.	1912	1923.4105

Then it follows from the first law of thermodynamics that the heat received per cubic foot of fluid per second is equal to the product of the specific heat by the rise in temperature per cubic foot of fluid per second or Q (Tl — T2) = c, [I where T2 is the temperature of the water out of the pipe and Q the mean quantity of heat passed from the surface to the unit mass of water in a second. Now Reynolds showed by his investigations on surface friction that, if we write a = away for the mean velocity of flow of the unit volume of water treated as a viscous liquid, where a is an empirical coefficient depending on the conditions of motion and on the law of the molecular viscosity, then a is also the frictional resistance per square foot of the surface.	1912	1944.3049
In France, for example, English is taught as a language, and French boys learn science in English, because they know that English is the language of the great modern literature of science. But in Egypt, where Arabic is the language of the great modern literature of science, students are taught English as a language by being forced to use it as a medium of instruction in subjects they are not yet able to master in their own language. The whole system is based on a misconception. It is not the language that is important, but the literature. The question is not what is the language in which the student is to learn science, but what is the literature of science in which he is to learn it? And in Egypt the answer is not doubtful.	1908	1935.0557
While the Aurora and Achates kept up a heavy and damaging fire on the three wooden corvettes, the others paid especial attention to the Odin and Freya, who were concentrating their fire on the Gloucester. The Teuthis, which was acting as a scout, now that the enemy had given up the chase and the battle was on, reported that the British main body was approaching at full speed, and that three of their steamers were apparently in difficulties. The armoured cruiser Lutzow, seeing that her guns were no longer needed to combat the British armoured cruiser, turned her fire on the Aurora, and with her first broadside disabled that ship. With her second broadside, she shot away the foremast of the Gloucester, which fell with a crash upon the after turret. The Aurora, thus temporarily disabled, fell out of the line. The British cruisers now directed their fire against the Odin and Freya, and the latter speedily ceased to exist as a fighting unit. Lutzow, having completed her work on the Aurora, again turned her fire against the offending British ship and blew the after turret to pieces. The ship was now a shattered wreck, with her engines disabled and her guns silent. As the ship lay helpless, the enemy poured broadside after broadside into her, and she was finally sunk by a broadside from the Lutzow, which struck amidships.	1906	1915.2742
S and RAF. 14 have been tested with the trailing edge set down at angles of 4 and 8 degrees. The effect of such a slot is to keep the centre of pressure farther out on the wing, the slot tending to act as a small aileron. The result of the tests is shown in Fig. 12, where the curves for upward and downward gusts are seen to be separated farther apart than before. The result is, of course, that the rolling moment for a gust in either direction is greater, and that for a downward gust is somewhat increased, but the difference is not very marked. A slight increase in the warping effect is noticeable for both kinds of gust. The values of the rolling moments are the same as in Fig. 10. 41.	1912	1918.5426
"""It is not a transfer of power; it is a retention of power. ""Senator, do you mean to say that you think the legislature is a safer, sounder body than the people of the state of Oregon? ""I do not think so. I will take my chance with the people every time."" That was the thought in the minds of the people who conceived this idea of the initiative and referendum, and it has been embodied in the constitutions of a number of the states in the Union. In some states the initiative and referendum have been adopted with limitations, and in others they are practically unlimited. The underlying thought is that the people, through their representatives, should adopt such laws as they deem wise and in harmony with the public welfare, and when the representatives have failed in that duty, or 84  have enacted laws, the enforcement of which they deem unwise, the people should be able to say what laws should go into effect."	1911	1903.2242
"MILITANT MILITANTS MILITANTISM In more senses than one, the new Suffragette paper is militant. So far as we can understand, it is to be nothing less than a weekly chronicle of "" militant "" doings, and is to be written from the militant point of view. But who are the militants? We have seen it stated that a manifesto issued by certain self elected representatives of the Women's Social and Political Union defines "" militant "" as meaning "" a woman of action."" Let us dissect this definition. A militant is, according to Dr. Johnson, "" one who fights; one who is disposed to contend."" Dr. Johnson was, of course, a very old fashioned lexicographer, and the word might have been described to him by citing a passage in the Peerage, a work in which he is as good as surfaced. Such sounds a little musty, we admit, and we shall probably receive a circular from the Concise Committee of the Women's Social and Political Union, informing us that this article "" does not meet with the approval of the Majority."" A woman of action! In a word, a woman who does things — and is prepared to set about doing them independently. Shall we accept the new Suffragette definition of "" militant "" ? We venture to think that the "" militants "" are, not women of action, but women of indignation."	1911	1990.5001

"" Twenty-five cents will help us, "" said Marjorie, with a laugh. "" We don't ask our friends to give us anything they can't afford."" "" Well, then, I'm your friend!"	1913	1913.0421
CHAPTER V. LENSES AND THEIR USE. The ordinary camera is furnished with one of the many makes of rapid rectilinear lenses, and in nearly all cases this will be found satisfactory for general work. The amateur who intends to do only a little work, and that of the simplest kind, will find that the lens furnished with the camera will be all that he will need. The rapid rectilinear lens is made of two double glasses, or combinations, and is so constructed that it gives a flat picture, that is, the whole of the picture is equally sharp. The largest stop, or opening, is used for taking snapshots, and the smaller stops for portraiture. For a large group, and for all interior work, the smaller stops will have to be used, so that the length of time the plate is exposed will be long enough for the plate to register the action of the light. In fact, one cannot use too small a stop in making interior pictures, as the depth of focus is increased with the smaller stops, so that even if the figures are at different distances from the camera, all parts of the picture will be sharp. 24 For ordinary outdoor work, and for a large view, the larger stops will be found satisfactory. The amateur who intends to do any considerable amount of work should have three lenses, a rapid rectilinear for general work, a single combination for snapshots, and a portrait lens. The single combination has but one pair of glasses and gives a flat picture, but only a portion of the picture is sharp, the rest going off into a soft blur, and this quality is what makes it so desirable for snapshots, as the background is not sharp enough to detract from the figure.	1912	1879.8619
Anaesthetics were then unknown. I had to operate on many cases of hernia, and invariably gave the patient a good drink of whisky. I always made a large incision, and by seizing the sac and turning it inside out, without opening it, I could see the stricture and could cut it if necessary. The protruded viscera were then returned, and the sac was opened and ligated. There was never any trouble, as the man was always sober and grateful. The most distasteful of all my work was venesection. The lancet was then the only instrument used. The practice was universal, and I was supposed to be behind the times. The only consolation I had was that I seldom had to do it. When I did, I undertook the task reluctantly, and always made the incision much larger than was customary. I had no faith in the practice, and always told the patient that I would let out only a little bad blood, and would replace it by good. The true reason was that I knew he had very little blood to spare, and I wanted to be certain of getting what was required. The most difficult part of the work was the selection of the vein to be opened. Time was of the utmost importance, and I knew that while I was groping in search of the vein, the patient might die. In every case I was fortunate enough to find the vein at the first trial, and the incision was always made in such a way that I could slide my finger into the opening, and keep the vein exposed until the blood was seen to well up and flow freely.	1911	1874.1708
"The general effect is very beautiful, the lighting being apparently obtained by "" concealed "" incandescent lamps, and the use of coloured glass being specially to be noticed. Some of the effects are very striking, but the designers seem to have overlooked the fact that the decorative glass used in the windows was practically opaque, and so the real effect of the lighting was lost. The window marked No. 4 in the illustration presents a striking contrast to the others, and is decorated with lamps of various kinds, which are openly displayed, while the window is itself lighted by coloured electric incandescents. Nos. 5 and 6 are especially fine. The former shows a practical use of electric light in a shop window, while the latter illustrates a clever effect of reflected light in a very beautiful window."	1912	1873.0852
Mr. Mackinney had compared with some care the action of the electric light and of the different gas lights at his disposal. He was, however, obliged to confess that the work was very far from complete, and that, so far as he had examined the matter, it was impossible to lay down any hard and fast rules. He was, however, quite prepared to admit that with some colours the quality of the light was as important as the quantity, but not with all colours. With certain objects, especially those which “ ab sorb ” the yellow rays, the action of the light was more to be depended upon than the intensity; thus, the hue of a white dress was always enhanced by the absence of the yellow rays, and by the substitution of the electric rays in their place ; but the converse was the case with such colours as the yellow and orange ribbons, and, moreover, other colours such as violets and purples were often equally unfavourably affected.	1912	1884.2223
"Now, lads, for a last grand rush ! "" came a voice from the barricade. I recognised it as that of Fitz-John. The order was obeyed, and with a wild shout "" The last charge ! "" we hurled ourselves over the barricade into the street, and dashed at the enemy. I shall never forget that wild rush. We were like madmen. The Germans were taken completely by surprise, and for a moment they staggered back. But their discipline was too good to be broken. They quickly rallied, and, with a frightful hail of bullets, began to mow us down. 158 I saw Fitz-John fall. I saw the gallant young fellow, who had led the last charge, shot through the head, and he fell just as he was about to strike a German officer with his revolver."	1906	1877.2374
Hence the flash of the male would tend to fall upon the area previously illuminated by the female, and thus facilitate the locating of a mate. This advantage is of course reciprocal, since the female must also see the male by means of the illumination of the field by his flash. In this connection it should be noted that in those species in which the male flies above the female the light is emitted from the upper side of the body (Fig. 7). In those species where the male flies below the female, the light is emitted from the under side (Fig. 8). In this connection it is interesting to note that in the large genus Photinus the female is usually quiescent and the male active, but in the genus Photuris the reverse is true.	1911	1939.9977
Two classes of very discontented men exist in this country to-day: one is the Labour Party, which, having been in power for a short time, is giving a good deal of dissatisfaction in the matter of carrying out its pledges; the other is the body of unemployed, who are being driven into the most desperate of measures by their enforced idleness, and are being made the dupes of those who would use them as instruments of violence and destruction. There is little virtue in a Labour Party which cannot be kept true to its promises by the organised body from which it springs. One reason for the lack of disorganisation and discontent among other parties which have been in power is, that they were never under any delusion as to what their party was intended to do.	1911	1889.4999
You find out your error at San Sebastian, and perhaps make a mental note that they know how to enjoy life better there than in England, where clerical holidays are generally passed in boring ways at home. The music in the casino is very fair, and goes on alternately with dancing till late in the night. During the interval there are tableaux arranged before the open alcoves, and sometimes dance or sing and recite. The last of the series at the time of our visit was entitled '$600,000, ' and represented the delirious joy of a family suddenly enriched by such a fortune. The performance was liberally and rather piquantly endowed with moral reflections. Whoever did not die of envy on the spot was made to feel sorry for the dancers in the next tableau, which represented their family lying crushed beneath the weight of such wealth. The moral was evident, and met with loud approval. One singing girl was very pretty, and another had the fascination which often goes with a red face and white eyelashes. They were openly applauded. The audience did not include many of the local aristocracy, which prefers languorous nights on the beach, or idle afternoons at a cafe with a view. These people have beautiful houses just outside the town, and drive into it in droves in the cool of the evening.	1913	1875.1212

The Professor replied that it was just the same with the features of a person on the earth. When we are at a distance, and the light is good, we can see them well, but as we approach, and the light is very strong, and the outline of the figure is not well marked, we cannot see them at all. The great atmospheric effects, which were so striking when we were at a distance, and the moon was shrouded in a misty light, had now entirely disappeared, and the surface had a perfectly different appearance. The mountains and rings stood out boldly, and were well defined. We could see plainly that the whole surface was covered with pock marks and scars, and the great rays radiating from some of the mountains and craters were very striking features of the landscape.	1911	1871.0422

The books will be uniform in style and size, and will be published at a price of one dollar each. The first six volumes will probably appear in the following order: 1. The Evolution of the Horse. 2. The Teeth of the Horse. 3. The Micro Organisms of the Horse. 4. The Anatomy and Physiology of the Eye of the Horse. 5. The Diseases of the Eye of the Horse. 6. The Anatomy and Physiology of the Limbs of the Horse. The publishers will esteem it a favour if any requests or suggestions as to the order in which the subsequent numbers shall be issued are forwarded to them. [1] I. THE EVOLUTION OF THE HORSE.

2 1 o The question of the change of volume in these three cases is an interesting one. The volume may change: (i) Through a change in the length of the edges; (ii) Through a change in the angles between the edges; (iii) Through a combination of these two changes. It is clear that the original shape of the cube must be retained, otherwise (iii) is involved. (i) will occur when the changes in length are unequal, and (ii) will occur when the changes in length are equal but the changes in angles are unequal. Now (b) gives a twofold change in length of the edges parallel to the direction of the stress, and hence a change in volume by (i), but no change in the angle between the edges, and a retention of the original shapes, therefore no change in volume by (ii).	1908	1938.7516

This river rises in the Bering Glacier and in its short course of about 25 miles traverses a wide area of coal-bearing rocks. The Bering River coal field is about 50 miles long and 25 miles wide, and is bordered on three sides by the Pacific Ocean and the great Bering and Malaspina Glaciers. The area of coal-bearing rocks is about 1,200 square miles, and these rocks are almost entirely covered by the great ice sheets. The coal area is therefore limited to the edges of the glaciers along the Bering River and its tributaries. The first knowledge of the coal in this region was obtained by Davidson and Murray of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, who in 1892 found small outcrops of lignite in the mountains back of the Malaspina Glacier.	1911	1928.2773
and the drag on it is considerably increased. The result is that, when the machine is held straight, the drag is increased, and, when the machine is turning, the turning moment of the rear end is also increased, and the time of turn is lengthened. It is therefore desirable to make the negative moment less by moving the centre of gravity forward. This has been done in the new machine, and the margin of directional stability is now large. There is still a slight tendency for the nose to swing to the left, as is usual with British machines, but the effect is not pronounced. The lateral control is, however, very good. The rudder has a very small angle of incidence for a large yaw, and, on the whole, the behaviour is excellent. The lateral stability of BS. 1 was not very good, and the machine had a slight tendency to roll to the left. The lateral control was, however, very good. The new machine is much better in this respect, and the lateral stability is now large. The behaviour is quite satisfactory, and the machine does not roll to the left. 61. The curves for the new machine are shown in Figs. 24 and 26. The negative directional moment is not so large as in BS. 1, and the margin of directional stability is large.	1912	1892.8226
This formidable fleet, as it has been pointed out, is insufficient for a campaign, but is more than sufficient to deal with any probable hostile action in the North Sea, and will serve to protect our trade and our coast towns. If, however, any such action on the part of Germany should be attempted in the North Sea, we may be sure that the result would be to precipitate the inevitable conflict. But the telegrams from Berlin yesterday to the effect that the German Navy was mobilised, though not complete, did not cause any alarm at the Admiralty. Our mobilised fleet in the North sea is about four times as strong as that of Germany, and, as stated, is more than sufficient to deal with anything Germany could attempt in the North Sea. That is the most essential point. And meanwhile, with all this naval strength mobilised, the Army is also mobilising, and the railway companies which were mysteriously requested a week ago to have all their passenger trains complete and ready are also preparing to move their troop trains without delay.	1906	1888.6943
The entrance to this castle of giant like nature is limited to its ports, which are Table Bay (Cape Town), Saldanha Bay, Mossel Bay, Algoa Bay (Port Elizabeth), Baakens, East London, Durban, Port Natal, Beaumont, Port St. Johns and Kango, all situated on the coast of the Union of South Africa, with Port Nolloth and Lüderitzbucht in German South West Africa, all of which will be briefly considered hereafter. Keeping in mind the great cyclopean character of this southern land mass, a vestige of which may be seen at Table Mountain, we can readily understand how the Decanoesis, or system of communication, was set on foot by the great Boer trek north and west from Cape Colony. As indicated on the map, the Decanoesis at first was practically limited to the Vaal and Orange Rivers and included in the diagram. But, like the arteries and veins in the human body, the system grew in importance and branched out in all directions till, as we shall shortly see, it now constitutes one of the most wonderful systems of railways in the world. The central or Boer Republics being satisfied with toys, the great British toy manufacturer, the British Government, was called in, and has since carried the Decanoesis to the very gates of Africa. In a previous paragraph we compared the brain to the outer world of a human being; in this one the Decanoesis is likened to the circulatory system which keeps up the vitality through imparting strength receiving strength, giving out the impurities and renewing the energy.	1908	1896.3098
"I thought he was above that sort of thing!"" They were now moving through Park Avenue, and the street lamps shone on a row of tall, well - dressed men and women, who, like themselves, were out to enjoy the late summer night. ""Well, I'M not!"" said the voice of the girl in the automobile, with sudden vehemence. "" If he thinks I'Ll go to his theatre to - morrow, he's mistaken! I'Ll let him know that I'Ve had enough of him! And if mother asks why I'M not going, I'Ll tell her!"" ""Oh, don'T, Marcia! You know how she feels about Arthur!"" ""Of course! And I'M not going to be the one to let him spoil my life!"" exclaimed Marcia, with a passionate outbreak. ""Let him spoil your life?"" echoed Wagg. ""Why, he hasn't even begun to flirt with you!"" ""Well, I'Ve flirted with him enough!"" flashed Marcia, and the car stopped suddenly before a restaurant. ""Waggin, I'M going in there for a minute. You stay here. I want to see a man."" Wagg had no choice but to obey, and as he sat there he argued with himself that this was not a flirtation."	1913	1909.8898
Then, too, if the Earth is to undergo any material change in the distribution of land and water, that change must take place in the future, for now the distribution seems to be such as to give ])est opportunities for the development of life. But if oceans are to cover large portions of our now land surface, or if the land is to become broken up into many isolated tracts, then the conditions for terrestrial life must be less, rather than more, favourable in the distant future. But such changes, we know, must take place in the Earth, and thus, if we suppose that the present conditions in Jupiter are favourable to life, we may at least be sure that they must become less so in the future, just as they must become less so in the Earth.	1913	1895.3046
A few attempts have been made to bowl steam cars, driven by motor either on the road or by a dynamo 12 during stoppages, but none has succeeded commercially. Electric vehicles find employment for short urban journeys, where recharging presents no difficulty, but the odour of the galvanic pile as a source of power remains. Its time has not yet come. Distillation at a low temperature still holds the field, and though its range of application is limited, it suffices for modern requirements. The only recent improvement in it is the introduction of motor spirits, that is to say, of light oils of a relatively high boiling point, which have been separated from petroleum, and which burn and vapourise more readily than the heavier liquids. They are now being rapidly run down by the makers, but they are not yet widely known to the public. The ordinary owner buys a petrol at the corner shop, without realising that he is filling his tank with ol ; that he has less than a dozen varieties to choose from; that his car will perform best with one special form of spirit; and that his dealer can be educated to supply what he needs, if only an independent spirit can be secured. Until a few years ago the question of lubrication was of minor importance. Now it has become vital. Of the lubricating oil now on the market any car maker will tell you that 13 many varieties are worse than useless. He has had experiments made with them all, and can cite failures. It is impossible to be more precise in this connection, but it may safely be stated that the oil which is best for one type of car is bad for another; that the best oil is never the cheapest; and that bad oil is the ruination of any engine.	1907	1905.5648
"And then, as if in answer to his thought, she turned suddenly towards him, her face pale, her eyes aflame. ""Oh! I wish I could be a man just for one hour! Just one hour!"" she said. ""I would kill that man who shot the deer!"" ""But, madam, he was only poaching,"" Paul answered, surprised. ""He had no right to shoot the deer."" ""No right! No right! And I had the right to see that beautiful creature die! I had the right to hear its last cry! No, no! I would have killed that man! I would have shot him down in his tracks! I would have killed him for the sake of the deer!"" ""But, madam, he was only poaching."" ""I know he was only poaching. And I am only a woman. But I would have killed him!"" ""But, madam, he had no right to shoot the deer."" ""No right!"" she cried, her voice rising. ""No right! No right! And I had the right to see that beautiful creature die! I had the right to hear its last cry! No, no! I would have killed that man! I would have shot him down in his tracks! I would have killed him for the sake of the deer!""

The direction of the light is then seen, and the eye, if it be sensitive, suffers accordingly. This is of particular importance in the design of the apparatus used for electric lighting, for the surfaces of metals and glass are usually polished. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the construction of the lamp should be such as to shield the eye of the observer from all direct rays from the filament or other luminous body. 39 THE USE OF SHADES AND REFLECTORS As a general rule the light emitted from an ordinary lamp is not in itself so bright as to cause inconvenience by directly dazzling the observer, but it is a common complaint that the presence of a lamp in a room is a source of disturbance to the eyes, though the light is not directly looked at.	1912	1897.597
A little action on the part of the heart causes a flow of blood, and this blood, which is a liquid, has the property of exerting pressure on the walls of the vessels in which it is contained, and this pressure is exerted equally in all directions. The consequence is that if by any accident a small hole is made in one of the arteries, a jet of blood is squirted out in a direction at right angles to the wall of the vessel, and the energy of the heart is used not in nourishing the body, but in driving the blood to a distance, perhaps over the head of the unfortunate victim of the accident. The heart, in fact, is a pump, and the arteries are pipes carrying the liquid away from the pump. The only difference between the arteries and the pipes of a pump is that the former are elastic, and that the elastic recoil of the arteries 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 	1913	1883.9008
"In making this piece, cut a circular piece from the same card stock, i^/s"" in diameter, and glue it in the lower right hand corner, as shown in solid lines in Fig. 3. Now with a compass strike an arc of 3"" radius, centre at the lower left hand corner, passing through the centre of the straight edge of Fig. 2. It is best to accurately find and mark this centre and then set the compass point there, as the arc must be struck through this point to enable the ""angle of lens"" scale to be used properly. The piece you have just made is now complete. Take a piece of card stock 4x8 and place it horizontally on the table in front of you. Mark the centre line and then divide the two halves into twenty equal parts, as shown in Fig. 4. Strike the two arcs A and B one inch above the lower edge of the piece at the twenty and ten divisions respectively. The right hand half of this piece is now to be cut away as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 4. The arc A is the base of this cut, and the two vertical lines are parallel to the centre line and one quarter inch from it. The distance from the lower edge to the cut is left at four inches, to allow for the triangular piece, Fig. 6, which is to be fastened on the back of this part to reinforce it."	1912	1906.4038
I ve been ill, I ve been in pain, I ve been distracted, and I ve not been myself. It s the first time I ve ever been in a room where they were out of my sight. I told Jeffers I should not stay in the drawing room to be bored by the people who were making me ill, and I went out on to the terrace. I had the door open for a moment, and I heard the sound of voices and laughter. I couldn t bear it. I couldn t bear it. And you know, Herbert, I ve had no one to help me. I have had no one to help me. I couldn t bear it, and I went out to the terrace. I was only just out side the door, and I was going to close it, when I heard a man s voice say: I heard it quite plainly. I turned and saw a man standing in the shadow of a tree, and his hand was stretched out to the door. I thought he was going to come in, and I was terrified. I was terrified. I thought he was one of the people in the house, and I hated the thought of his coming in. I hated the thought of his coming in. I said: I said it to frighten him, and it did frighten him.	1906	1924.3795
"It is hardly a matter of legitimate difference of opinion, and certainly not one of mere abstract theorising, to say that a device thus tainted at its very inception, and thus fraught on every page with the danger of a ""popular tyranny, "" wrought by a ""tyranny of the majority, "" is worse than none at all. For, once given a place on the statute books, it may be turned to the basest account by unscrupulous men who are not deterred by any consideration of honour from violating the spirit, if not the letter, of their pledges. A good many of the erstwhile champions, even, of the referendum in the West have come to see and realise this truth. And it is under the pressure of a wholesome reaction against the folly and injustice of the haphazard, indiscriminate method of referring to the people the only real test, the sine qua non of a true referendum, namely, the power to originate as well as to veto, that many of the opponents of this measure have springing up again, like the proverbial mushroom, a so-called ""two headed referendum, "" and are clamouring for it as a panacea for all the ills that mankind is heir to, or at least of all the ills that the political body politic is afflicted with. Unquestionably the safest, as well as the most effective, referendum that can be devised is one that will embody the principle of popular initiation, and as well that of popular veto, or ""submission."	1911	1849.806
Thus the dominant race is composed of 8,742,301 Magyars, 1,678,569 Croats, and 1,052,180 Servians, who together number 11,473,050. This indicates how the problem is complicated by the fact that the Magyars themselves, although they dominate, are not entirely homogeneous, and that the Croatian and Servian races, who suffer most from Magyarland, being included in the Slavs, number 2,730,749. In addition, the Slavs are divided into several races, such as Slovaks, Ruthenians, Slovenians, and so forth, and are also divided in allegiance, part being loyal to the Magyar Government and part agitating for separation. Of the Roumanians about three-fifths are loyal, and of the Germans about two-fifths are loyal. Thus, putting the loyal elements on one side and the disloyal elements on the other, we have the following distribution: LOYAL ELEMENTS. DISLOYAL ELEMENTS. Magyars - - - - 8,742,301 Roumanians - - - 2,799,479 Germans - - - - 2,135,181 Slavs - - - - 11,473,050 (Slovaks, etc.) These figures, of course, are only approximative, but they show clearly enough how the Austro Hungarian Empire is divided.	1907	1936.2552
I have no wish to enter into the question of land nationalisation. I am not concerned with that, but with the right of the individual to a reasonable share of the means of existence, and with the fact that the present system is denying him that right. Mr. Hunt is also mistaken in thinking that I am an advocate of the old system of Poor Law relief. I am not. I am an advocate of the new Poor Law, which will be based on the same principle as the old age pensions, and which will make the giving of a pension to a man who has seen better days as natural and as free from stigma as the giving of a pension to a soldier who has fought for his country.	1911	1880.8406
"He declared that "" a species is a collection of individuals which, by the common possession of certain external and internal characters, are distinguished from all other collections of individuals, and constitute, in the ordinary course of nature, the whole offspring of a common stock "" ^ The first part of this definition is a reiteration of the usual definition of species as conceived by the naturalists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The second part of the definition is a proclamation of the doctrine of the fixity of species, in a form to be discussed later. The most important thing to remark here is that Buffon had gone back to the Aristotelean definition of species, which he had rejected so categorically in the first volume, and which had been abandoned by all naturalists for some generations."	1911	1906.7045

The first greenback was issued February 25, 1862, and by the end of the year there had been issued $150,000,000, and by the end of the war $450,000,000. A great part of the expenses of the war was paid with these notes. The first issue was made under the act of February 25, 1862, and was for $150,000,000. The second issue was made under the act of July 11, 1862, and was for $50,000,000. The total issue under these acts was $200,000,000. This was the first greenback money. The notes were made a legal tender for all debts, public and private, except duties on imports and interest on the public debt. The first issue was signed by J. W. Denver, register of the treasury, and L. C. Baker, treasurer of the United States. The second issue was signed by John Campbell, register of the treasury, and John J. Cisco, treasurer of the United States. The first note was for $5, and was of the same design as the notes of the second issue. The second note was for $10, and was of the same design as the notes of the first issue. The third note was for $20, and was of the same design as the notes of the first issue. The fourth note was for $50, and was of the same design as the notes of the first issue.	1911	1912.2408
"""I don't blame the woman who is used to doing her own work, "" remarked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. "" I think it's a great deal better for a man to give his own money and buy things than to have his wife go out and work for it."" ""Yes, "" said Mrs. Fitzpatrick, "" there is a difference. A man can do without a lot of things a good while, but a woman cannot."" No, "" answered Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, "" a man can't do without a lot of things very long, either."" The man who is unaccustomed to bestowing favours usually puts his foot in it. It was on a British war vessel that an officer found a sailor who was a great deal the worse for drink. "" Man, "" he roared, "" d'ye know what 'tickled your grandfather?"	1913	1905.265
In the department of social life, however, the greatest confusion prevails. The problem of human happiness is the most important, the most interesting, and the most complex with which man has to deal. It is the one problem that cannot be relegated to experts. The average man must himself take part in its solution. Therefore, the process of guess work has not been abandoned in this department of human activity, but is still the prevailing method. The most intelligent guess work, to be sure, is employed, and for that reason the failures are less numerous than they would be were the average man less intelligent. But the method is essentially unscientific and for that reason is attended by much suffering and many blunders, exposing the guessers to the scorn of the intelligent and the pity of the altruistic.	1911	1911.0492
But if the employment is not under an express contract, the engineer or architect is entitled to reasonable compensation. 261. Lien Laws for Engineers and Architects. (1) Some states have enacted lien laws for the protection of engineers and architects, which will be found in the appropriate section of this book. (2) In many states where there are no lien laws for architects and engineers, they are held to be within the general mechanic's lien law, and may therefore avail themselves of the lien provided by such law. (3) The right to claim a lien under the mechanic's lien law depends on the law of the state in which the works are located. 262. Free Passes. (1) An architect or engineer is not entitled to free railroad passes as a matter of right; but such passes may be given him by the railroad company if they so desire. (2) A railroad company may give its agents and employes free passes to an architect or engineer in consideration of their certifying the amount of the work done by its employees. 263. Recovery of Compensation. (1) An architect or engineer can recover for his services only for those rendered in good faith, and not in violation of law, or his contract with the employer. (2) If the contract is partly executed, the architect or engineer is entitled to recover on quantum meruit for the value of his services. (3) If the contract is broken by the employer, the architect or engineer can recover the contract price less the damages sustained by the employer by reason of the breach.	1913	1905.4358
"He must be on his guard, and his chief weapon would be discretion. Valetta's sole confidant was the Duchess, and in the Duchess's heart there was no room for another. When the Duchess was not in the house, when she happened to be at Lady Robson's, or at the Oratory, or at a garden party at Lord Abingdon's, Black took daily Mrs. Sykes to the Heath, or they explored some other portion of London, always avoiding the West End, where it is possible to be tepidly fashionable without being particularly interesting. On Sundays he took Mrs. Sykes to the Oratory. There he was greeted with delight by the Rev. Alfred Blenkinsop, the vicar, who invited him to a choir tea, and then to a supper in his own house, combining the two functions. Black accepted both. "" We are having an inspiring time, "" said the vicar. "" I am in the midst of a course of lectures to the choir on ' Hymn Writers and Hymns.' As a matter of fact, the choir has been sadly ignorant. I don't think more than three of them knew who Dr. Neale was."" "" I hope they realise his importance, "" said Black. "" Oh, indeed they do."	1913	1880.3977

The magnitude is about the same for equal angles of yaw on opposite sides. The lateral force is approximately proportional to the sine of the angle of yaw. The centre of pressure for the resultant force in the vertical plane, defined as the point where the resultant of lift and pitching moment cuts the horizontal plane at the step, moves forward as the angle of yaw increases. It is about 5 ins. forward from the step at zero yaw, and about 2-5 ins. at 25° yaw. The lift is approximately proportional to the cosine of the angle of yaw, and the drift is approximately proportional to the sine of the angle of yaw.	1912	1976.7477
The term Americanism has been used to designate not only an idiom, a word, or a mode of speech which is characteristic of Americans, but also a word or phrase which is not English, but which is used universally in English speaking countries. In this sense it is practically a synonym of Anglo Saxonism. The term has also been used to cover the entire vocabulary of the United States. This is to confound the one with the other. The one is a part. The other is the whole. The one is a selection. The other is the substance, the material of which the selection is made. The one is a collection of words and phrases which are peculiar to the United States. The other is the aggregate of all the words and phrases, the idioms and modes of speech which are in use in this country. To illustrate further. The one is a collection of words and phrases which are not found in the vocabulary of England, but which are found in the vocabulary of all the other Anglo Saxon countries of the world. The other includes all the words and phrases which are peculiar to the United States, whether they are found in the English vocabulary or not. It includes also those words and phrases which are not found in the English vocabulary, but which are found in the vocabulary of the whole world of Anglo Saxon countries.	1913	1932.3126
"When at last, nearly every one of the pilgrims had emptied his money 12 pouch into the slop basin, the priest returned to the deck. The captain looked in the basin and wept for joy. He took off his cap and said: ""Sir, I am a sinner, and sailing is my trade. I have lost a good ship three times, to the bottom she went, and this time I thought she was doomed also. But I will repay every kopeck that you have collected."" Then he called the sailors. The captain ordered them to pray also to St. Nicholas, and he ordered the engines to be reversed with all their strength. And they did. And the ship, tearing up the water, began to rise. The water poured off her sides, she rose, and rose, and rose."	1913	1906.329
"Her surest mark of contempt was to call a boy ""baba's little man."" She knew that this term of endearment was not intended for boys, and that it was one of her mother's most effective weapons in controlling her. The general principle involved here is that of the persistence of an image in spite of variations in the stimulus. We have seen that the child is sensitive to variations in the stimulus as compared with the original image, but the persistence of the image itself is a phenomenon of the same order as that involved in the learning of a poem by heart. The child is not puzzled by the fact that the words of the poem can be altered without altering the poem. She is not puzzled by ""daddy pops, "" ""poppy dads, "" and ""papa's little man"" because she has learned that the meaning of words is not to be identified with their sound. She has learned that the same meaning can be expressed in different words, and that different meanings can be expressed by the same words. She has not yet learned, it is true, that a single word can express many meanings, but she has learned enough about the symbolic power of language to be able to use it freely and with discrimination. The next step for her is to learn that a single word can have many meanings, and that the meaning of a word is often determined by its context."	1911	1973.6168

The actual worship of the Greeks was little more than an acknowledgment of the divine power of the gods. It was a form of respect offered to them, whether it were simply appropriate ceremonial, or the taking part in the popular festivals. It was expected of course that one would do these things, but such acts could hardly be called belief in the doctrines of the gods. Hence men could continue to pay this form of worship, and yet give little or no actual belief to the doctrine of the gods as taught by Homer and Hesiod. The real belief which kept the community together was loyalty to the state. To this everything else must be sacrificed. Hence, in a sense the Jew, who could not give this loyalty and who refused to worship the gods, was a disloyal citizen, and the Athenians held that, although Socrates was a good citizen, he could never be a good Athenian because he did not worship, as they did, the gods on the calendar.	1911	1872.6812
"It must also be remembered that at such large angles of attack the lift coefficient is still rapidly increasing when a small disturbance in the angle of attack will tend to the production of a restoring force in the longitudinal direction. For the letters used in this chapter Lanchester's condition may be re-written in the approximate form suggested in 89, 90, and 91, namely 5c ^ 0- V£r* a) 5 where S is the area of the horizontal tail. 97. Direction of Longitudinal Stability Forces and Moments. — The forces, velocities, and moments which appear in (46) and (47) are not fixed in direction. In effect they are the variables x, y, z, and p, £, r of the mechanism of 85. The first three direct the flying direction as a whole, the last three direct the position of the flying angle in the arc described by the mechanism. The distinction is of importance in a study of stability ; but in a machine like the one used for illustration it does not enter into the determination of the forces and moments, and in the present condition of knowledge it cannot enter. Experience has to be relied on for the assumption that the directions are the natural ones, and, as a matter of fact, it is the assumption that a "" tail "" always pulls its front into the direction of its own motion, and vice versa, which enables us to assign the directions."	1912	1946.0013
Assume for wrought iron, 25 x 106 lbs. per square inch as the modulus of elasticity, 0-0000068 F. as the coefficient of expansion, and neglect the effect of the difference of expansion between the two metals. 6. A brass and a steel wire 1/32 inch diameter, and 6 inches long, are rigidly fastened at their ends to a brass plate, and a force of 10 lbs. attached to the middle of the wires is then applied in the direction of their lengths. What is the increase of temperature, if any, in the wires, if the plate is held at the same temperature? What would this increase of temperature be if each wire was 30 inches long instead of 6 inches? The values of E and a to use are : For brass, E = 12 x 10° lbs. per square inch, a = 0-00001 F. For steel, E = 30 x 106 lbs. per square inch, a = 0-0000062 F. 7. A hollow brass cylinder 2 inches internal diameter, 1/16 inch thick, and 8 inches long, contains water at 100° F.

XLIV / Impressionism is a technique of representation, and not a philosophy of life. It is, however, a technique that is often associated with a superficial and momentary view of the infinite. The impressionists are concerned not so much with the immediate objective reality as with the effect of that reality on the artistic imagination. In the resultant pictures the emphasis is laid on the transient and the personal. XLV / The neo — impressionism of Seurat is a step in advance of the romantic individualism. The technique is still that of the pointillists, but the canvases are often constructed with a view to the harmonies of movement and colour. XLVI / Art Nouveau is the product of the industrial revolution. It is a naive attempt to make the machine feel at home in the house. The styles adopted are eclectic, and the ornament is often a straining after the sensuous rather than the intellectual beauty. XLVII / The new sculpture is a reaction against the superficiality of the Victorian school. The modeling is often vigorous and the details well thought out. The compositions, however, are often forced and the themes trivial. XLVIII / The new architecture is a combination of the practical and the æsthetic. The façades are often a mere plastering on of decorative details. The interiors are spacious, and the structural features are left exposed. XLIX / The new industrial art is a compromise between beauty and utility. The ornament is often borrowed and applied without understanding.	1913	1962.0961

MADAM, — The last few issues of your paper have contained letters from correspondents who appear to think that the housing problem is confined to the working classes, and that the only alternative to the present system is to become a "" landowner."" May I point out that the majority of your readers are probably in the same position as myself. That is to say, they live in lodgings or ""rooms,"" and besides being most inconvenient and unhomelike, this system is a constant drain on our resources. It is, of course, impossible for us to ""landlord"" ourselves, as we have no one to boss but ourselves. May I put in a plea for houses. Most of us are now getting to the stage when we want to ""settle down, "" and surely the demand for houses could be met without the System having to give way. I cannot believe that, even if the majority of the population owned their own homes, there would be no houses to let, which, with the present system, would mean no houses to landlord. — Yours faithfully, L.

"Nor can we doubt that under the leadership of this ever widening brotherhood of nations the whole world will be influenced to follow in the same path. The second encouraging sign of the times is the growing belief in the efficacy of the Christian way of meeting personal and national wrongs. The world is beginning to see that the remedy for hatred, injustice and oppression is not more hatred, injustice and oppression. ""An eye for an eye "" leads to universal blindness. The true solution of the problem of race hatred and sectional prejudice is not the shotgun nor the sword, but the schoolhouse and the church. To meet the wrongs of individuals and nations with the spirit of Christ means the lifting of the world into the realm of eternal righteousness."	1911	1953.1173
The more the fat is hydrolysed the greater is the amount of free acid present and the higher is the acid value. The acid value is calculated according to the formula : milligrammes of KOH x 1000 mg. fat The KOH used is converted into caustic potash by igniting the KOH previously to its use. The method of determining the acid value is as follows : 1 gramme of the fat is dissolved in about 50 c.c. of alcohol (sp. gr. 0-84), 1 1 1 and the mixture titrated with decinormal sulphuric acid, using phenolphthalein as an indicator. The end reaction is obtained when the alcohol is neutralised and the free acid formed is neutralised. The titration is usually carried out in the following manner : The alcohol is heated to 60° C, 50 c.c. of the decinormal acid are run into a porcelain dish and heated to the same temperature, and the fat dissolved in 50 c.c. of alcohol is stirred into the acid. The heat is maintained by placing the dish on a hot plate. The titration is complete when the mixture no longer shows an alkaline reaction to litmus. The reaction is hastened by stirring with a glass rod. The mixture is then cooled and the excess of acid determined by titrating with caustic soda.	1913	1972.4698
The obstructions to visibility are of two classes, natural and artificial. The natural obstructions are terrain, weather and light. The artificial obstructions are masts, towers, buildings, and wires. The terrain consists of mountains, hills, valleys, and plains. The mountains and hills obscure the view of the valleys and plains. The valleys do not obscure the view of the mountains and hills. The obstructions offered by the terrain are not serious when the aircraft is cruising at 5000 feet and the terrain is less than 3000 feet. The weather consists of wind, rain, snow, and fog. The wind does not obscure the view, but it may be of such violence as to make flying dangerous. The rain, snow, and fog do obscure the view, but the rain and snow are not serious obstructions to visibility.	1913	1936.2545
CHAPTER VII THE DIGESTION AND METABOLISM OF FARM ANIMALS 1. The Digestive Processes 11. The Digestive Organs 1. THE DIGESTIVE PROCESSES It is not necessary for the purposes of the feed investigation to enter into a detailed study of the anatomy of the digestive organs of the different species of farm animals or of the histology of these organs. It is, however, essential that the investigator should understand the fundamental facts concerning the processes of digestion and metabolism which are common to all animals and which underlie all rational methods of feeding. The process of digestion is the breaking down of the complex and diverse materials which make up the food into forms suitable for absorption and for use by the organism. The process of metabolism is the use of these materials by the organism.	1911	1958.3658

"But not all strong characters are born of rough usage. The lumber hound breeds more strong characters and more bad characters than the blood hound does; and the blood hound does not always do it. And the worst of it is, that in this rough-and-tumble programme the few that would have gone through without serious moral or intellectual damage never get their chance. We at least ought to be sure that the men who come to us in their teens, with the character, the poise, the balance, the self control, the sense of manly honour, the ideal of a manly life, which their fathers and mothers have tried to give them, do not suffer from the unreasoned requirements of our unreformed systems. "" But this is not the defence of the system of commonsense and human observation which is growing, half consciously, in many colleges and universities. The defence is rather that, after all, it is the only system that works. We may wait for years before getting college deans and professors to speak out frankly about this matter; but already the records of nine genera tions at Harvard University, of seven generations at Yale University, of three generations at Princeton, and of two generations at the University of Michigan, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, and many other institutions, all the way from Bates College to the University of Minnesota, are abundantly teaching us that there is very little correlation between college standing and success in the world."	1911	1906.6512

The present Report contains the results of a number of investigations into the aerodynamic properties of aerofoils. (i) The first investigation, which is described in paragraphs 74 to 75, is a continuation of the work described in Reports No. 5 and 10. The results have been obtained with a large series of models, having a plane lower surface and a camber of O'lOO of the upper surface. The position of the maximum ordinate has been varied from 0-25 c. to 0-75 c. The results are plotted in curves showing the lift and drift coefficients against the angle of inclination of the aerofoil to the stream. These curves are similar to those given in Report No. 5 for an aerofoil having a maximum ordinate at 0-50 c. It is shown that the lift coefficient is independent of the position of the maximum ordinate, while the drift coefficient is greater the further back the maximum ordinate is placed. The drift coefficients are compared with the values given by the formula 0- 2 0- 2 where c is the chord of the model and a is the angle of inclination of the aerofoil to the stream. This formula is found to give a fair approximation to the drift coefficients for angles of inclination up to about 15°.	1912	1935.6075
"How much can we enjoy?"" It is a path well marked, easy to find as you walk in the ways. The signs stuck up at the cross roads say. ""The Way of Folly."" ""The Way of Death."" But the warnings are ignored. Down the years a throng of human beings has surged and jostled and passed. Many of the figures of monstrous size are blurred in their outlines. The faces have grown pale and pinched. The eyes have become dull. The mouths have begun to droop. The feet drag heavily. There are many signs on the way which one may read if one will. ""Passed this way and paid."" ""Paid with health."" ""Paid with peace."" ""Paid with honour."" ""Paid with character."" And others. ""Passed this way and repassed."" ""Repassed by a way of shame."" ""Repassed by a way of crime."" ""Repassed by a way of despair."" And so forth."	1908	1938.1324
Henry, who seems to have been still alive to the necessity of some compromise, actually offered him the leadership of the Royal party, a proposal which Simon repelled. He now had the whole of England against Henry, except the Welsh, who were neutral. Even the powerful officials of the North were driven into Simon's arms by his energy. The Earl of Warenne, the Earl of Ferrers, Hugh Bigod, and the other heads of the baronage of the North rose in arms ; the Bishop of Durham and the Earl of Lancaster with their dependents aflame against the oppressor. Simon, with swift action, hurried northwards; and on the 18th of May he had won the great stronghold of York, and was master of the northern baronage. A northern baron now became the leader of the Royal party, the young Earl of Richmond, the son of the King of France. He was attractive and brave, and he made Simon's opponents his friends. The Earl of Ferrers was won by his active and personal valour at York, and in the campaign which ensued this handsome young noble, with the fiery energy of his race, rapidly rolled back the tide of Simon's victory. By the end of June he had regained York, and laid siege to the great castle of Dover, the key of Simon's domain, and by far the strongest of the Cinque Port fortresses. For two years it had held against every siege, and now it was only weakened by the necessity of sending a portion of its garrison to strengthen the Earl of Ferrers before the walls of Rochester, the second most important stronghold of the South.	1912	1886.2028
"The latest vessels of the destroyer type have also been fitted with Parsons turbine engines. For merchant vessels the turbine engine has many great advantages. It is simple and compact, it requires very little manual labour to tend it, it is easily started, and, by freeing the propeller from the necessity of using a clumsy shaft and various frictional gearing appliances, gives much higher effective results. The only disadvantage is that the turbine is more costly than the ordinary engine. But, as with many other inventions, as the use of the turbine becomes more general the cost will be lessened. It has been calculated that, allowing for the difference in cost, the turbine engine gives a 30 per cent, greater effective power than the ordinary steam engine. For the use of the turbine for land vehicles there is as yet no promise. Mr. Parsons says that the difficulty lies in the fact that so far all experiments in this direction have been with steam turbines, which are not suitable for road engines. Gas turbines, on the other hand, have not yet been made a practical success."" In the automobile, as in every other invention, there is a constant striving to attain speed, and the car that travels the fastest is the one that the manufacturer and owner alike desire to possess. Hitherto, the petrol car has led all competitors in this respect, but lately the steam automobile has begun to divide honours with the petrol driven machine."	1907	1898.8983
"The bedding was a source of much anxiety to us, for the landlady pointed out that the sheets and blankets were ""all marked,"" and we were only consoled by the reflection that if they were marked they were at least clean. The following morning we were awakened by a loud knocking at the door, and the voice of the landlady calling out — ""It ain't no use a tryin' to get up, 'cos I knows you're up, an' breakfast is ready."" This was true, but we had intended to get up in our own time, and not at the dictation of the landlady. However, we rose, and descended to the breakfast room, where the table was spread with a cloth on which were several great brown stains, and the breakfast service consisted of a plate, a knife, and a fork for each of us. The tea was made in a cracked jug, and the milk was served out of a tin can, which was also cracked, and through which the milk dripped on to the floor."	1908	1894.6635
On the contrary, a very different conclusion is supported by the facts of science. The forces of the different fields of phenomena overlap and interlace. The forces of each field act to a greater or less degree upon the phenomena of the fields lying next above and next below in the scale of evolution. The chemical forces, for example, not only act upon the phenomena of the atomic field, but also upon the phenomena of the molecular and organic fields. The phenomena of each field are thus to a greater or less degree, composite. Each field of phenomena is a product of the forces of its own field acting upon the phenomena of all the fields lying next below in the scale of evolution. The phenomena of the atomic field, for example, are the product of the molecular and cosmic forces acting upon the phenomena of the molecular field. The phenomena of the chemical field are the product of the molecular and cosmic forces acting upon the phenomena of the atomic field, and the chemical forces acting upon the phenomena of the molecular field. And so on. The phenomena of the social field are the product of the biotic, psychic and social forces acting upon the phenomena of the organic and organic fields. The forces of each field, on the other hand, act upon the phenomena of the fields lying next above in the scale of evolution, as well as upon the phenomena of their own field and the fields lying next below.	1911	1925.0466
(Michel de Marolles, in preface to his translation of Shakespeare. ) 1 [These words were written in 1850 and refer to a translation of about half a dozen plays made by Le Tourneur in 1775 and never published in full. A complete translation was issued by the same translator in 1784, but apparently it was never republished in full. — Ed.] the English, in whom the poet has struck the chord that vibrates most strongly in their hearts. The French, who are not less knowing or less intelligent, have not the same sensibility to the qualities of the poet, because they have not the same qualities themselves. They are naturally less inclined to appreciate that grand and terrible side of nature which Shakespeare depicts with such boldness and such masterly strokes. . . . . . . . . 1 [Shakespeare is now a classic in France. The first complete translation appeared in 1846-72, under the editorship of Charles and Emile Augier. — Ed.] . . . . . . . . [In the second extract from his preface, Schlegel follows his predecessor, Goethe, in expounding the theory that the plays fall naturally into two great divisions, the tragic and the comic, and showing that the great comedies of the first period Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth have a tragic atmosphere in spite of their being classed as comedies.	1912	1883.7267
""" Yes, I know. I'M not a politician — thank the Lord. I'M just a squire and a steward. But the governor — — "" He stopped. His brow darkened, his handsome, boyish face began to show signs of what his friend, with his blunter powers of observation, would have called "" age."" ""The governor is all for reform, of course, and he's getting old. And this — this miserable Thornton manages to upset him. Thornton pretends to want to help, and he's a perfect devil of hard work. ' S queers and hustles things. It makes my father doubt me sometimes."" His lips trembled over the last words. He thrust his hands into his pockets and began to walk up and down the room. "" I will tell you, Lester, what Thornton is. He'S an agitator, any kind of agitator — a trade unionist, a land reformer, a secularist, whatever you choose. And he'S a fanatic.

"Does the average allopath know what specific medicine is used in homoeopathy for pneumonia ? It should be known to the laity that the so-called "" advance in medicine "" is simply a new application of old remedies. Quinine, the first effective specific that came to the knowledge of the profession, was discovered, and its use popularised by natives of tropical South America long before the days of Christ. Iodine, discovered in 1812, was used by the Egyptians 249 centuries before Christ. Mercury, arsenic, copper, lead, etc., all familiarly known poisons, were used in the old school long ago, and are still used by eclectic practitioners, and by charlatans of all kinds, but are now dropped by homoeopaths as they were dropped long ago by the sect known as Thomsonians and Eclectics, who preceded the allopathic school of today."	1911	1897.3811
"Now, the ancients, as I told you, were familiar with the production of light without heat, and the question arose whether by the application of this principle, if understood, the world might not be saved from destruction by fire; for however far off the cataclysm may be, that is, the final annihilation of this planet by fire, it certainly is looming nearer and nearer, the day of its completion being foretold by physicists with more or less accuracy. I ought to mention, however, that we are assured by geologists that even if the earth escaped being swallowed up in the general cataclysm of its sister planets, it would then be the scene of terrible volcanic upheaval, accompanied, no doubt, with a reign of fire. But I will not further harrow your feelings. THE END APPENDICES APPENDIX A. THE following letter has been kindly placed at my disposal by Sir William H. White, to whom it was addressed by Captain W. W. Fisher, R.N.: — "" H.M.S. Powerful, "" "" Longmoor, "" "" Hong Kong, "" 18th September 1903. "" Dear Sir William White, — I have been experimenting with a new form of incandescent lamp, which was sent to me by Mr. H. H. Mortimer, of Poole (see enclosure). It consists of a coil of platinum wire, about one eighth of an inch in diameter, enclosed in an envelope of very thin glass. When it is desired to use the lamp, the glass is broken off, and the wire connected with the terminals of the battery."	1913	1891.1136
"""Did you not see me at all?"" she asked, her voice very low. ""I hid behind a tree, and never meant to be seen."" ""I saw you, "" he said, with a laugh, ""I saw you all the time!"" ""Then why did you not speak?"" ""I was afraid of frightening you."" ""You were right, "" she said, ""you would have frightened me — and now I will tell you why I laughed at you from behind my tree — because I thought you looked like a runaway schoolboy!"" ""I was a runaway schoolboy!"" he said, ""and I am one still."" ""I wondered, "" she said, ""as I sat there, what you were running away from."" ""I am running away from the life that is killing me. I am a clerk in a terrible place called a department store. I work fifteen hours a day, and I am paid six dollars a week.""

"The shelves should be of dark wood, and the floor should be of wide boards, stained a dull brown.

"" It would be a pity to banish him to the moon, "" said Mr. Pickwick, "" for he might come back with the Man in the Moon, and that is a worse person than he.

Call at No. 17, Skelton Street."" He went to the address, and found a tall, thin, elderly gentleman sitting at a table covered with papers. ""I saw your advertisement, sir, "" the man began; ""and being short of money, I thought I would call, and — "" ""Short of money, are you?"" interrupted the gentleman, ""so am I.

The man took a piece of paper, folded it up, and drew a pencil across it. ""There, sir, "" he said, displaying a sixpenny piece. ""Now, sir, may I ask what you want to sell?"" ""I want to sell you this piece of paper for sixpence."" ""Very good, sir."	1913	1901.6271
"The difference between this and the old ""help wanted"" sign is that, instead of describing the job, the Exchange describes the man needed. It states in detail how many years he has been at work, what he has worked at, what he has achieved, what he is able to do now, and what he is fit for in the way of work. The Exchange sets the standard for labour. With the cards of the men who have died in the war, or who have removed from England, or who have ceased to be labourers, are printed the words: ""Not available."" In the past, the labour market has been like a horse pond. A horse pond gives the horse a chance to drink, but it does not furnish him with food or shelter."	1913	1938.4437
"It may be mentioned that the lamps used in these displays were only 1-5 watts per candlepower. The use of "" Tubolite "" for street lighting has been advocated by Mr. H. W. Houghton, and I am able to show you a sketch (Fig. 17) of a street in which he has arranged for its application. The sketch is, of course, only a suggestion, but it is interesting to note that the street is only 50 ft. wide, and that the lamps are placed 28 ft. above the ground, and yet the spacing is 80 ft. apart. A practical test of the method has been carried out in a narrow street in South London, and the result was very satisfactory. The lamps were 16 watts, and the illuminance averaged 0-8 ft. candles on the roadway. The cost of the installation was about £50 per lamp. I must not omit to mention the use of "" Tubolite "" for lighting the interiors of buildings. In the first place, it is most valuable for lighting up ceiling domes, and I am able to show you a photo (Fig. 18) of a dome so lit up. The lamps are placed in a circular trough, and are arranged to give a uniform illuminance over the whole surface of the dome. The photo is not a very good one, but it will be seen that the effect is pleasing."	1912	1891.068
"These two disturbances together may even be looked on as a general disorder of the metabolism of fats, for in both cases the supply of glucose is deficient, and the breakdown of fats to form energy brought to a standstill at an early stage, before the fats have been fully oxidised to carbonic acid and water. This points to the general conclusion that fat needs carbohydrate in its oxidations, is broken down with difficulty when the carbohydrate supply is deficient, and that the normal metabolism of carbohydrate itself may be disturbed by the presenee of an excess of oxidizable fat. The breakdown of proteids and carbohydrates, on the other hand, appears to depend little on fats. This is well shown by the feeding of fat in excess in the so-called "" protiensparend "" mixtures. When the proportion of proteins is relatively small, the fat may be increased to a very large amount with a relatively slight increase in the carbonic acid excretion, the appearance of the urine and general health remain good, and the animal thrives. And it is a common observation, although the reason is unknown, that a small daily intake of fat greatly facilitates the assimilation of protiens and carbohydrates. The effect of excess of fat in the food on the excretion of nitrogen has been carefully studied by several observers (Voit, Bunge, Pettenkofer and Lind, Rubner, E. Müller and H. Lange, J. Müller and Kauff.)"	1913	1930.0662
We have seen that the insect parasites are usually much smaller than their hosts, and their smaller size probably facilitates their entry into the host body and enables them to find more easily the tissues which they wish to utilise for food. But besides this the habits of the insects as a rule make them much better suited for the dissemination of their parasites than are the mammals or birds. Thus, we have seen that many of the insects live in communities, and that even those that are solitary are often members of communities in which closely related species have different habits or are found in different localities, and thus the parasites have a better chance to find the organism which they require. Moreover, the insects are much more numerous than the vertebrates and, having a much shorter individual life, they reproduce much more rapidly. Hence, even if the percentage of parasitised individuals is about the same for insects and vertebrates, the absolute number of hosts supplied is much greater in the case of insects. As an illustration of this we may mention the fact that in 1909, at the Farasitological Laboratory at North Melrose, 77,000 parasites were reared from the gypsy moth 4 and 43,000 from the brown tail moth. These were liberated in the woods of eastern Massachusetts. The following year over 200,000 parasites were liberated, and the work is being carried on with constantly increasing results 5 .	1911	1933.8622
The crosshead is connected to the screw by a nut and block, which is fitted with an adjusting screw to allow the crosshead to be raised or lowered according to the length of the test piece. The 421 Fig. 211. Fig. 212. testing piece is placed on two supports, and the straining is applied through a v nosed piece on the lower side of the crosshead. Fig. 212 shows a very compact machine by the same makers for 5 tonne tensile tests. The straining is applied through a hand wheel, the mechanism being entirely enclosed to protect it from injury. 422 Double Lever Machines. — A very popular type of testing machine is that in which two levers are used, one for each side of the test piece. The two levers are connected by a crosshead which travels in vertical guides, and the test piece is placed on two fixed supports. The two levers are connected at their outer ends by a horizontal bar, which is pivoted on the outer ends of the levers, and is also connected by a screw to the inner ends of the levers. The outer ends of the levers are also connected by a screw to the inner ends of the levers. The horizontal screw is turned by a hand wheel, and its action is to raise or lower the outer ends of the levers, and thus to change the angle of the levers with the horizontal. 423 When the horizontal screw is turned so as to raise the outer ends of the levers, the inner ends of the levers are lowered, and the crosshead is thus lowered on the test piece, and vice versa.	1908	1929.0325
How many would gladly participate in a campaign of systematic observation ? Besides the immediate interest, the result would be of the highest importance, were only the methods of observation and communication worked out. The idea of a Social Survey of a City is not new, and there are many such surveys in process of realisation or already accomplished. But these surveys are devoted to special subjects and are limited in scope. It is the conception of a General Survey, a Survey of the City as a Whole, that is new and that is here proposed. If, then, a Survey of the City as a Whole is one of the aims of the Department of Sociology, it is clear that the city student must begin his work in the Field and not in the Library, and with Observations and not with Books. He must go into the Field with definite problems in mind, and with a definite plan for the solution of these problems.	1908	1897.086
You are too well acquainted with the true Situation of the Ballet to be misled by the Representations of any Person, and you will not suffer yourself to be influenced against an old Servant by the Suggestions of a Young one, who, I am persuaded, has no other view in making them to you, than to serve himself. I am very far from being his Enemy; and I cannot but think him a very good Dancer; but I have seen very good Dancers before him; and I have seen very good Dancers made by the assistance of the Opera. I am not so selfish as not to rejoice in the Success of any Young Man who has the good fortune to please the Public; but I must think myself justified in saying, that this Young Gentleman has no pretensions to the superlative Excellence which is claimed for him by the Managers; and I have been so little blinded by Jealousy, as to be able to perceive, that his Dancing is not equal to that of several Men who have danced in the Opera before him.	1912	1868.7906
""" Now, Anna, don'T start that way! You are going to have your fuss with all the women everywhere — don'T begin it here!"" cried John Adam, angrily. "" You know very well that I am not starting it. I haven'T talked about her or to her — I am trying to be good."" He turned and went away from her. John Henry said to Lizzie, ""Anna is down on you bad now — you better be careful."" Lizzie sat down in the middle of the dial and pulled the weeds that were in tufts in the corners. She hummed a tune. The warm, moist air was heavy with the smell of the honeysuckle, and the sunlight was so intense that it seemed to quiver. Anna saw her from the window and turned her back, and taking two small silver cups that were on the table, she went down the hall to the kitchen. "" You better come up to the parlour, "" said John Henry, angrily, to Anna. "" You don'T care for her, or you would look like it."" "" That is what you want, "" said Anna, sullenly. "" I don'T want anything!"" shouted John Henry. "" I wish to goodness I hadn'T married! I wish I was back on the farm!"" At the kitchen door stood Lizzie, her arm resting on a chair, holding one of her feet with her hand."	1913	1960.4565
The most common and best known example of this is the 37 phenomenon of the hysterical paralysis. The arm is no longer obedient to the will, not because the motor centre is injured, but because the path going from the centre of consciousness to the motor centre is out of order, — out of order because the impulse to move the arm, which was related to some disagreeable experience, was not allowed to go out. It was kept within the mind, and from that time on the two centres, the one for consciousness and the other for motion, have been kept apart by a psychic scar. This scar is now a hindrance to the voluntary action of the arm, but it does not hinder the involuntary movements. The arm can still be raised by the physician without the patient's knowledge, and it can be moved by the power of suggestion. This is, of course, a very crude way of stating the matter, but it will serve to illustrate the importance of the connection between the feeling effect of an experience and the rest of the mental life. We shall have to study this relation more closely in connection with the theory of the emotions, but it is well to have the matter suggested at this time in order to impress its significance. 38 CHAPTER III THE EMOTIONS 1. The existence of a feeling tone or quality in the process of apperception has already been suggested.	1909	1927.4708
Hence in a negative that is to be used for enlarging the pinhole must be eliminated. Removing the Pinhole Marks. — There are two methods that can be adopted for this, either of which is effective. One is to take the negative in the right hand, and with the left hand thumb and forefinger, or with a pair of tweezers, grasp a corner of an unexposed piece of flat film just large enough to cover the offending mark, and then press down the film so as to cover it, and at the same time to squeeze out the air from under the film patch. The other and better method, in my opinion, is to make use of a small, round, sharp, and rigid, but not excessively, (iv) sharp pointed, style, which I have had made specially for the purpose.	1912	1904.6556
The leaders of the movement were not always in accord on the theory of money but they were united on the need of monetary reform. The struggle for the free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 was bitterly fought for many years by the populists, the silver republicans and other independent groups. It was a hard fight for the adoption of the Chicago platform in 1896 that resulted in the nomination of Bryan for the presidency. The movement swept everything before it in 1896 and again in 1900 but the fight was lost in the election of 1900 when McKinley was re-elected. The monetary issue was not practically before the people again for several years until the agitation was revived in the spring of 1906 when the national monetary commission was organised and began to formulate a plan for the establishment of the Aldrich Bill. The Aldrich Bill was promptly opposed by the leaders of the progressive movement in Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota and other western states. It was not an easy matter to unite the insurgents in Congress against the bill because many of the insurgents were divided between the factions that were fighting for local and sectional interests. But the opposition was consolidated by the vigorous and militant progressives. They were led by La Follette and his fighting legion of western insurgents who were determined to wrest the control of the government from the predatory interests, especially the railroads and the banks.	1911	1946.1975
In the first place, we must be careful to distinguish between the natural and the acquired abnormality of the mind. Mr. Shaw's genius has all the characteristics that can be derived from the former. It is instinctive and spontaneous. It occurs as a part of Nature's plan. It is a faculty like tallness or musical skill, and is not at all to be confused with the effects of individual experience, culture or education. It is essentially a gift, a mere matter of heredity, and is displayed, for instance, in the case of the man who was born with the ability to perform prodigies of calculation. On the contrary, the madness which genius is supposed to share, is unnatural and acquired. It is not inherent in the mental constitution of the man, and the effects of culture are here 271  responsible for its manifestation. Hence, as long as you do not insist that Shakespeare's genius is of the same quality as his madness, the paradox is tenable. But, on the other hand, we have for our consideration a much stronger claim of genius to this community with madness, which is to be derived from the much vaunted theory of the sub conscious mind. According to this, genius is a manifestation of the sub conscious, which has no moral sense and no reason. It does not recognise or obey the conventions which safeguard the normal consciousness, and hence appears at first sight to share with the madman all that is wild and dangerous in the absence of control over impulses.	1911	1891.1088
In the Dominion it is stipulated that every person shall abstain on that day from all unnecessary work or worldly amusement. In France the law prescribes that every person shall suspend his labour on Sunday, and also on the Festival of the Assumption, August 15, the day of the French National Festival, the 14th of July, and on Christmas Day. In both countries the laws are enforced by penalties. In Canada as well as in the United States the question as to what constitutes unnecessary work or worldly amusement is frequently the subject of litigation, and often leads to the gravest difficulties. The Canadian law leaves the question to be determined by the judgment of the Justices of Peace. In Massachusetts the police of Boston were directed, some years ago, to prosecute all persons who persistently violated the Sunday laws. This they did with the result that the courts were soon overburdened with cases. Most of them were dismissed by the judges, who did not consider the violations serious enough to require punishment, but some of the cases were carried up to the Supreme Court, where they were decided in favour of the Justices of Peace and the police. In New York city a similar movement was made by the police, but it was soon abandoned. In Toronto, Canada, the sheriff summoned a number of merchants, and the question was submitted to the Court of Appeals, which decided that the sale of ice cream from a push cart was unnecessary and therefore legal on Sunday, but the sale of it from ice cream parlours was illegal.	1907	1910.2236
A striking feature of the American school is the preponderance of the urban population in the school system. This is the common experience of all modern nations. In 1900 the urban population of the United States was 40.5 per cent of the total population, while in 1910 it had increased to 46.3 per cent. In 1900 the urban population contributed 57.9 per cent of the total value of the public school property ; and in 1909 the urban schools received 67.3 per cent of the total expenditure for public school purposes. The urban school system has developed a type of school which is not found in the rural school system, namely, the high school. In 1910 the high school was attended by 23.4 per cent of all pupils enrolled in the public schools. But this urban school system is confronted with difficulties which are not met in the rural school system. It is a striking fact that the increase of the urban population is not accompanied by an increase of the teachers in the public schools. Between 1900 and 1910 the total urban population increased by 10,579,385 ; but the total number of teachers in the urban public schools increased only by 57,062, or one teacher for every 185 pupils. The consequent increase of the average number of pupils per teacher in the urban schools was from 47.3 to 56.6. The urban school system is also confronted with the problem of the transitoriness of its population. The average attendance in the public schools is 88.3 per cent of the total enrolment.	1909	1929.4077
but also the results of the more advanced branches of biology. That light is as yet but dim. It would be rash to conclude, from the fact that many of the most important races of mankind are mixed races, that intermixture is a conditio sine qua non both for the progress and for the survival of mankind. For, in the first place, pure races cannot be said to be wanting among the civilised peoples of the world, and, in the second place, it is questionable whether mankind, as a whole, could not survive and advance by means of pure races. The present degree of intermixture is not the only conceivable one; and it may be possible, by means of judicious selection, to obtain from pure stocks the finest specimens of mankind in every conceivable respect.	1908	1885.6694
"And now as he sat there, looking up into the grand snow crowned hills beyond the valley, a new longing came over him — a longing to give up the struggle, to surrender the coveted happiness, to resign the hope that was eating into his heart, and to go forth into the fighting world again in the spirit of his Master who had not where to lay His head, and whose period of active service was bounded by the brief space of three years. ""I will go away at once, "" he thought. ""It is better that I should do so; perhaps if I break off all connection with it, it may fall into other hands, hands more fitted than mine to carry it out."" The thought afforded him a moment's relief. He was about to rise and walk back, that he might pack his few necessaries and be off by the first train, when the young woodsman from the lodge came up the hill towards him. He was carrying a small bundle of rushes in one hand, and using a stout stick as a crutch for his lame leg. ""Good morning, sir, "" he said, ""I had a notion I should find yer here; I seed yer tracks in the snow."" ""Well, what have you to say to me?"" said Philip, with an impatience which was almost ungracious. ""I have only come to ask that you should have the goodness not to take me into your counsels any more. I do not want to hear anything about your plans for the chapel, nor about Lady Dagmar, nor about anybody connected with her."	1908	1893.9784
204 and 205 represent a vertical machine made by the firm of W. Fairbairn and Sons, of Manchester, to the design of the late Sir William Fairbairn. The machine has a vertical steel cylinder, into which the test piece is placed, and in the top of which is a circular hole for the passage of the chain or rod by which the load is applied. The test piece is gripped in the cylinder by means of cast iron jaws, which are brought together by a screw and hand wheel, and the load is applied by a steel rod (Fig. 205), which passes through the top of the cylinder and is attached to the test piece by means of a special coupling. In this case the load is applied by a single steelyard lever (Fig. 206), the fulcrum of which is formed by a knife edge (a) resting in a slot in the vertical supporting column (b), which is built up of I section steel bars.	1908	1895.5985
The day from which Fig. 6 is taken (November 2, 1910) was one on which the average velocity was rather high, being about 14 mph., but the character of the gusts was such that the maximum velocity attained was only 30 mph. Further, the highest hourly average was 18 mph., the maximum number of points per hour being 7.7. This shows that the wind was of a steady, continuous type, as judged by the scale of the anemograph. On this day the average overrun was 1.4 mph. and the maximum per hour 2.4 mph. The day represented in Fig. 7 (November 17, 1910) was one of lower average velocity, this being only about 10 mph., but one on which the gusts were much more prominent, the maximum velocity being no less than 48 mph.	1912	1924.671
The Romans never had any difficulty in dealing with the tribes of the peninsula, and the Exe, therefore, was not of such vital importance as a strategical frontier obstacle as was the Nene. The Nene, on the other hand, was not a complete obstacle, and the Fenland was not a complete obstacle, nor is it so to this day. The Romans, however, had no such means at their disposal for the conquest of a country as the modern engineer possesses, and had to rely upon their own strength and the strength of their beasts of burden. It was therefore necessary that they should avoid impassable marshes, and such marshes as were found in the Fenland were therefore a further protection to the Britons, and made the Nene a more effective barrier than the Exe. The Fenland, however, was not a serious barrier to a determined foe.	1912	1875.3363
CHAPTER V THE INFLUENCE OF THE SCANDINAVIAN INVASIONS ON THE ART OF THE ANGLO SAXONS IT has been necessary to establish definitely the origin and character of the art of the Anglo Saxons before we can understand the changes which were brought about by the Scandinavian invasions of the ninth and tenth centuries. One of the most important of these changes was the introduction of the animal style, which had been developed in the north of Europe, and which was in its full vigour when the Danes and Norsemen poured over the northern and eastern parts of England. The new style, with its new ideas and its new methods, was in strong contrast with the imported art of the early Christian period. The invaders brought with them not only their inventive and artistic genius, but also their traditions of art, their ideas, their forms, their methods, their motives.	1904	1894.2205
"The most remarkable phenomenon of all is the so-called "" lunar transient phenomena."" These are brief appearances of clouds, bright spots, and other objects on the surface of the moon, which are inexplicable to the present day. They are not very frequent, but enough have been observed to show that they are not the result of mere optical delusion. They have been seen by many observers, including Lord Rosse, Schmidt, Nasmyth, and many other skilled astronomers, who have used various kinds of telescopes. They are not visible to the naked eye, and they are not seen with equal distinctness at different times. They are usually seen with a light, small telescope, and not with a large one. They are sometimes seen in one part of the moon, sometimes in another; but none of them has ever been seen in the Mare Serenitatis, and very few in the Mare Imbrium."	1913	1881.8035
An architect or engineer may be dismissed or discharged by his employer, but not without good cause. The employer has no right to terminate the contract of employment without good cause, when the engineer or architect has entered into a contract with a third party to perform services for the employer. 201. Performance of Service. — It is the duty of the architect or engineer to perform the services for which he is employed in a skillful and workmanlike manner. He is not required to be a perfect architect or engineer, but he is bound to exercise that degree of skill and diligence which is ordinarily exercised by architects or engineers of similar experience and ability in the same kind of work. 202. Term of Service. — If the employment is for a definite period, the architect or engineer is entitled to be paid for his services for the entire period, even though the employer does not require him to perform the services for the whole period. 203. Dismissal or Discharge. — An architect or engineer may be dismissed or discharged by his employer, but not without good cause. The employer has no right to terminate the contract of employment without good cause, when the architect or engineer has entered into a contract with a third party to perform services for the employer. 204. Extra Work. — If the contract provides that the architect or engineer shall be paid a certain sum for his services, he is entitled to receive no more. He is not entitled to recover for extra work performed, unless the employer expressly requested or ordered him to perform the extra work.	1913	1890.5436
"The Liberal party as a whole has never been committed to that doctrine of (the) State ownership of everything which is held by the extreme Socialists."" The Labour Party. — Mr. Hardie stated (September 6, 1906) that the Labour Party was formed at the last General Election, when 29 Labour men were returned. Its purpose was to secure that Labour Members should never again be put in a position of having to choose between allegiance to class interests and allegiance to party interests. It had since the election been agreed between the Labour Party and the Liberal Whips that the Labour Party should vote for Liberal measures in return for a Liberal vote for Labour measures. Mr. J. H. Austin, Liberal M.P. for the City of Worcester, writes (September 8, 1906): — ""I cannot believe that any large number of members of the Labour Party are prepared to go the whole hog of Socialism."	1907	1916.6515
"He said he was glad to see that the Government had appointed a lawyer to the post of Under Secretary of State, instead of a mere politician. ""I am not sure that he is a lawyer, "" I said. ""He is only a Scotch lawyer."" ""Scotch lawyers are better than English lawyers, "" said the Colonel. ""They are more learned, and they are more honest."" ""Ah, "" said the Colonel, ""there is a great deal of difference, I believe, between a Scotch lawyer and an English lawyer. I have never had much to do with English lawyers. I am afraid I am a very unlearned man. I have been in the army all my life."" ""But you must have read a great deal, "" I said. ""Oh, yes, I have read a great deal, "" he said, ""but I am afraid I have not read the right books."" ""What books have you read?"" asked the Colonel. ""I have read a good many novels, "" I said, ""and some poetry."" ""And a great deal of history, I am sure, "" said my wife. ""I am afraid not, "" I said, ""I have very little memory for history. I am always confusing dates and places. I can never remember who was Prime Minister in a certain year, or what battle was fought in a certain year, or what country was annexed to England in a certain year."" ""But you remember the events themselves, "" said my wife."	1913	1905.9528
— A wire rod of diameter d is rigidly fastened at one end to a frame, and a load of W lbs. is hung from the other end. If the modulus of rigidity of the material is J, how far will the free end move vertically ? Assume the angle of twist to be small. 1. Assume the modulus of elasticity E to be given. The angle of twist is Wd irJ or, vertically, wd irJ But, from the theory of simple bending, the vertical movement is wd2 3EI Hence, equating the two expressions for wd irJ = wd2 3EI or, vertically, w d 2 3E Hence, the vertical movement is 1. wd2 3EI 2. Assume the modulus of rigidity J to be given. The angle of twist is Wd irJ or, vertically, wd irJ Hence, the vertical movement is wd2 3EI EXAMPLE 6. — The spring of Ex. 4 is now bent, from its vertical position, through an angle of 2t radians, so that the ends of the coils, instead of being in the same straight line, are at a distance of 2r sin t from each other.

Maidens, resplendent in mantillas and gold, and with flowers in their hair, are escorted by cavaliers whose belts and saddles are heavy with weapons, and whose spurs jingle in rhythm with the madly prancing steeds. It is the fiesta day; the day of the bull fight; and, like the ancient Romans, the people are rushing to see the gladiators contend with the lions. The seating capacity of the Plaza is over 17,000. When all are seated, the doors are closed and guarded. The musicians and the president of the show enter last. The musicians are all in white, with sashes of bright colours, and the fanfaronades they toot on their trumpets would arouse the dead. The president, dressed in the height of fashion, is a dignitary; he wears a rosette and receives the respectful homage of the audience.	1913	1888.8228
Above this concentration it again produces fog, and at about four per cent the fog produced by sulphite in strong solution is just doubled. This is a very serious fact for those who, like myself, have been in the habit of putting large quantities of sulphite in the developer in order to preserve the negative. It means that we have to be very careful that our sulphite is pure and fresh, for it is only under these conditions that it can be used in anything but small quantities. It is much better to use the best and freshest sulphite in small quantities than to use large quantities of inferior sulphite. It is quite a common experience that old sulphite, even when carefully crystallised out, is much more fog producing than fresh sulphite.	1912	1908.4061
The mixed fatty acids obtained by warming poppyseed oil with alkali and alcohol have been described by Hartley as yielding two tetrabromostearic acids with melting points 80° and 84°, and a tetraoxystearic acid with melting point 178°. Of these acids the first two may be isomeric with those from pigs' liver. A mixed fatty acid obtained from linseed oil by the same method yields a tetrabromostearic acid melting at 79° and a tetraoxystearic acid melting at 177°, and may therefore contain the same acids as the poppyseed oil fat. It is not known whether these fatty acids from animal tissues are identical with those obtained from the vegetable oils. The acids obtained by the action of alkali and alcohol on castor oil have been described by Hartley as yielding a tetrabromostearic acid melting at 81° to 82°, and a tetraoxystearic acid melting at 177°. These acids are probably identical with those obtained from poppyseed oil. Sherer and Reimer have described a fatty acid obtained from the oil of the liver of the codfish which, like ricinoleic acid, yields a bromostearic acid melting at 97°, and a bromooxystearic acid melting at 116°, but does not yield an oxystearic acid melting at 178°.	1913	1973.8806
The staff consists of the Principal, Dr. Jones, formerly Professor of Chemistry in Cape Town University, three doctors, and two or three teachers. The average fee per student is only £ 1. The prospect is very bright. The people are keen, and all the funds are at the disposal of the Council of Education. The school is not likely to be long confined to the iron buildings. The immediate plan is to get out a local manual for practical work in the various subjects, and in connection with this I have written to some of my friends here and in England, asking them to suggest problems for local students. The idea is that the students will be more likely to work at a problem set by a man of science they know, than at one suggested only in a book.	1908	1913.1348

"That man has lived on his reputation, and on everybody else's reputation, long enough. I'M going down to Martover myself next week, and I'Ll find out all about him. I'Ll expose him, and down he comes, root and branch!"" And he slapped his knee thunderously. Atherstone looked at him in amazement. Was he mad? But Coryston was quite sober. He had evidently reasoned on the subject, and had come to the conclusion that the well known hunter and homeopathist of Martover was a fraud, and needed exposure. It was a curious instance of the power of a mere suggestion. The suggestion of an epidemic, of anything like a breakdown among the neighbouring horses, had set a whole pack of running, though nearly all the hounds had been excluded from any such idea."	1913	1902.5719
"It strikes me, Amelia, that your mind is getting very much unsound on these subjects. I'M afraid it is the fault of that Mr. Moore who comes here now and then; he gives you those horrid books to read, I'M sure, and makes you talk such nonsense as you never talked before. I don't know what Mr. Moore can be thinking about!"" "" He thinks a great deal about you, Mrs. Peppercorn, dear, "" said the little woman, with a slightly contemptuous smile; "" and I'M sure I wish you would both of you get rid of this ridiculous prejudice towards one another. "" "" I don't know what you mean by prejudice, "" returned her indignant mistress. "" I'VE no prejudice against the man; I'M sure he is a very clever man, as you say; but that can't make me like him, can it?"" "" And as for getting rid of any feeling towards him, Amelia, I'M afraid you have none to get rid of, for you have never shown any whatever. You have had the same cold, distant manner with him that you have with every man you have ever spoken to in your life. "" ""I never saw you show any manner to anybody, Amelia, "" interrupted the little dressmaker with a smile. "" You always treat men as if they were women and as if you were the woman, "" continued the offended Mrs. Peppercorn. """	1908	1891.8165

"The peculiarities of women are one of the great unsolved problems of the universe. Men never act like that. I saw a fellow I hadn'T seen for years the other day, and all he did was to say: ""Hullo, Buck! You in town?"" and walk on; and I was perfectly satisfied, and so was he. ""That was Mabel, "" said Mrs. Sammerton, rejoining us. ""Oh, yes, "" I said, ""I thought she looked familiar — not as familiar as some people, but familiar."" ""Now, Frank, what do you mean?"" she said, reproachfully. ""By the way, "" I said, ""who is that stout gentleman in the silk hat and the black frock coat?"" ""That is Mr. Wisher, the Cashier, "" she replied. ""Don'T you know? Oh, I see you do!"" I didn't say anything, but I felt proud of my knowledge. He was the only man in the street that didn'T take off his hat when Mrs. S. passed, and she, of course, was the only woman he didn'T bow to. We finally reached the Zoo, where we had a great deal of fun talking to the animals. The elephants were particularly entertaining."	1912	1905.275
It is easy enough to provide light enough to make everything visible, but it is quite a different matter to provide the right quality of illumination for specific operations. Avoid excessive diffusion. An absolutely glareless light is usually impossible. But excessive diffusion is not a good way of getting rid of glare. In the first place, it requires a more powerful lamp, and means greater expense. Secondly, it makes the direction of the light uncertain, and thus leads to unexpected shadows. Avoid defective shades. If the lamp is easily in jured, use a glass shade. Otherwise a cloth shade may be used. But see that the shade is kept clean and extends right down close to the base of the lamp. If the shade is not close to the base, the light from the naked part of the lamp is sure to be dazzling.	1912	1912.478
"When the mists are rolled in winter and the sun is gone, we sing a cooling hymn.

"" Oh, I don't know — like a frog in a new pot of water that is being heated gradually, I suppose."" "" Dagmar! "" "" Yes, mama?"" "" Come here, child."" Dagmar rose from her father's knee and went over to the sofa on which her mother's head was propped by cushions. "" I am tired, dear; I want you to go down to the nursery and take care of your little brother till I call you."" Dagmar's heart sank at the prospect of losing her father's company, but she said submissively, "" Yes, mama, I will."" "" No, you won't, Dagmar!"" exclaimed Mr. Duncan, angrily. ""Dagmar never does what I tell her, she always does what you tell her."" "" Never mind; I told you to do it, and you are going to do it,"" replied Mrs."	1908	1909.9967
This distribution is an excellent example of the phenomenon of the correlation of parts and of the mechanical hypothesis. Fig. 6 b shows the force diagram of a thighbone under the action of a couple and an axial pull. Combining this diagram with the equation of moments, we obtain the direction and intensity of the resultant of the internal forces, indicated in Fig. 6 a. The result may be considered the mechanical explanation of the peculiar distribution of the trabecular bone, a distribution which is a visible record of the mechanical history of the bone. The mechanical hypothesis underlies a large portion of the modern theories of the structure of substances. The phenomena of the strength of materials, elasticity and plasticity, fatigue, fracture, and the mechanical properties of crystals, are all susceptible of a more or less satisfactory explanation on mechanical lines. The mechanical hypothesis has been most fruitful in chemistry. The peculiar distribution of atoms in molecules, as inferred from the number and energies of the various chemical unions, is partially based upon the mechanical hypothesis. Numerous other hypotheses, such as the kinetic, the hypothesis of the continuity of matter, and the atomic hypothesis, based upon the mechanical hypothesis, have been used with great success. The mechanical hypothesis forms the basis of the kinetic theory of gases. The hypotheses, however, run riot in this field.	1911	1949.8082
"As we stood there, looking out upon the wide, white world, our thoughts went back to the little room in the old farmhouse where the Founder of Christian Science was born, and we recalled the words of one of her biographers : — "" It is a quiet little room, with a window at each of the four sides, and the view from each is quite different from that from any of the others. The window on the south looks out upon the barnyard, where the hens and turkeys cackle and gobble and scratch; the one on the west, upon the road, where the oxen slowly drag their loads to the mill; the one on the north, upon a stretch of cold, desolate, and unbroken wilderness, and the one on the east, upon a more cultivated and pleasant landscape."	1911	1896.9886
59. SOUTHEAST. 2. SEAPLANE. — This is a reconstruction of the SOUTHEAST. 1. The body has been raised and lengthened by some 4 feet, and the whole design has been modified to meet the experience gained with the earlier machine. The propeller is now placed on the centre line of the body, and the rudder has been enlarged. The machine has been tested on the water, but has yet to be flown in the air. 60. SOUTHEAST. 3. — This machine, designed by Mr. H. Farman, is a further development of the earlier types. It is fitted with a 70 HP. Gnome engine, and the total weight of the machine is 400 lbs. The wing area is 262 sq. ft. and the length of the body 24 ft. 6 in. The distance between the wheels is 10 ft. 6 in. and the distance between the wings 3 ft. 6 in. The total area of the three surfaces is 338 sq. ft. The area of the fixed tail is 50 sq. ft. and the area of the rudder 7 sq. ft. The machine has been tested on the ground, but has yet to make its first flight. 61.

There is no watching or guessing; just fix the time and give the negative that amount of developer. For films, I recommend the Paterson tank, and for plates, either the Paterson or the Ideal. I prefer the Ideal for plates, as it is much easier to load. For a developing box, I have a small one, made of black cardboard, which will hold six plates, or six strips of film, and is about the size of a half dozen boxes of candy. It is fitted with one or two developing dishes, and has a removable top, the lid sliding in grooves. There are little hooks on the inside of the top, which hold the plate or strip of film while it is being developed. When I am using the tank for developing plates, the developing box is used for developing the same number of films at the same time. The box is made so that it just fits into the tank. It is a very convenient and practical little affair. For fixing, I have a small dish, made of white enamel. The dishes sold at the five and ten cent stores will serve the purpose very well, but I prefer the enamel dishes, as they do not stain, and can be cleaned very quickly. For developing papers, I have a dish, also made of a piece of black cardboard. It holds two or three prints comfortably and is very shallow.	1912	1914.6958
As the elastic limit is not exceeded the stress and strain are connected by Hooke's law, and the energy per unit volume is therefore ! ES. The total energy is the volume times this quantity, or — 1J EV. * Similarly, the energy spent in producing an elastic extension of a unit length in pulling out a nail or screw is ^ P/ 42. Resilience. — The power of a material to regain its original form is known as resilience. The term is also applied to the elastic strain energy per unit volume, that is, to 4- EV. It is generally taken to mean the maximum energy which can be stored per unit volume without risk of permanent set. This quantity may be determined graphically, as shown in Fig. 45, the area of the triangle and of the loop if there is a double curve being measured. 43. Comparison of the Resilience of Different Materials. — The resilience may be compared in different ways, but in any case it must be remembered that the absolute amount of strain energy stored for a given extension will be greater the larger the initial length. The following are methods of comparison sometimes in use : (1) Take the total area of the stress-strain curve. In this case the units of length do not appear in the formula, and the quantity is independent of the length ; but it is dependent on the diameter of the specimen.	1908	1921.3401
Of their ten genera quite half are peculiar to Australia. Hence the evolution of our Frogs has not been very extensive. The Tailless Amphibia are even cosmopolitan, but our Bombinatoridae are peculiar. Our last family of Apoda, the Soi icidae, is represented in America, and a second family has made its appearance in Madagascar. Appearance of Mammals in Australia. — Every group of Air vertebrates, after its brief terrestrial existence, has taken to the water, and evolved in that environment our aquatic types, — Dolphins, Otters, Seals and Manatees. The Birds are well represented in these transformations, and even the Lizards have developed aquatic types. But none of our modern Mammals possess a swimming member. Moreover, as already said, every family of modern Mammals is represented in South America. But, on the other hand, in Australia we have certain groups of monotremes and marsupials which are absent elsewhere, and reappearance of these at corresponding stages of evolution in our immigrant orders of placental Mammals is prevented by their incapacity for natural selection. Completion of the Fauna and Flora of Australia. — The Mammalian migrants have reached Australia from time to time, and have each time brought a few aliens, say Cats and Rabbits, which have subsequently spread over the whole continent.	1909	1915.3481
But the shading must not be perfunctory. It is a matter of common observation that when a lamp is lit, it reveals the shade, and its defects, as much as the furniture. The indirect system is that in which the source of light is concealed from view, and the light is reflected from the walls and ceiling back into the room. This plan has the advantage of producing soft shadows, avoiding the glare of the naked source, and permitting a more uniform distribution of the illumination, but requires a larger expenditure of power to produce a given effect. The distribution of the reflected light depends largely on the colour and texture of the surfaces of the walls and ceiling; hence, in this system, it is all important to use light and smooth surfaces.	1912	1880.5099
Well into the nineteenth century the Teuton formed a large percentage of the immigrants arriving in this country, but the number of Germans seeking a new home in America has lessened to an astonishing degree since the close of the Civil War, and now the large number of Italians arriving every month in Castle Garden, together with the far greater number entering other ports, are the immigrants we see swarming about us. In the past little attention has been paid to these newcomers by the intelligent American. The Russian Jew and the German may be watched with playful interest, but the Italian is too often regarded with antipathy. Yet, as time goes on, our insatiable craving for cheap labour is bringing these people into stark competition with our working classes.	1911	1911.0786
"But we have seen that even the apparent increase of German exports is illusive. The exports of Germany and the United Kingdom compared are as follows: — Year. Germany. United Kingdom. £ £ 1895 162,642,000 226,128,000 1900 171,068,000 248,469,000 1905 273,796,000 330,023,500 In Poland the exports fell from £ 11,000,000 to about £8,500,000, and even the exports of the Rhenish Westphalian provinces to France, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland fell from 79,497,778 and the enormous increase of exports through Hamburg came to an end after 1904, as a comparison with the official figures for Hamburg shows (cf. Germania, Hamburg, 19 Dec. 1908). In her tariff reform agitation the British Government ignored these inconsistencies, and likewise the fact that the so-called '• dumping "" in German colonies filled the British colonies with German manufactured goods, and that these colonies could never come to be a very important market to Britain. The British Colonies imported in 1905 German goods to the value of £11,780,000, and British goods to that of £ 16,600,000, mainly from the United States, as the following table shows: — Imports of British and German Goods into British Colonies in 1905.

In all factories visited, the standard of lighting was found to be adequate. Glare. — The second requisite of local lighting was also found to be fully satisfied, glare was absolutely absent. Shadows. — The third requisite was found to have been complied with, for no troublesome shadows were cast on the work. In addition to the above three points, which are essential for perfect local lighting, it may be mentioned that the lighting was always of a good quality. In two factories, however, the lamps were too high up to allow of the best lighting being obtained. The lighting in the factories visited may be said to be not only adequate but good. CHAPTER IX. CANADA LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY, TORONTO, CANADA. (By J. LAVIS.) Building. — The building of the Canada Life Assurance Company is eight storeys in height with a basement, and it covers a space of 120 feet by 150 feet. The basement is used for the storage of records and for the heating and other machinery of the building. The first floor is used for offices of the President and Vice Presidents, the Secretary and the Manager. From the second floor to the eighth inclusive, the remaining offices are located. The Company employ about 400 persons, of whom about 300 are office employees, the remainder being engaged in outdoor work.	1912	1874.8827
"He trusted and believed that there would be no withdrawal from the land policy which had already done so much good, and which was in all respects the best land policy that had ever been applied to Ireland."" Mr. Chamberlain. — "" So long as the Liberal party was united in this policy of Home Rule for England, and Irish autonomy in all local matters, Irish unionism would have some local support, but the Conservatives were playing a losing game. The Ulster situation was far from strengthening their hopes. He regarded the Ulster Protestants as among the most staunch and gallant of their countrymen. They were the descendants of the best of England and Scotland, the men with whom England had colonised the hands which met the savage Irishman sword to sword, and who finally conquered and softened him."" Eye, bullseye!"	1907	1900.8331
Nietzsche, too, was a woman hater. But the hatred of Nietzsche, unlike that of Weininger, was impersonal. It was hatred of woman as she is, not of woman as she was or might have been. To clarify my meaning, let me pause for a moment to consider the genesis of Nietzsche's hatred. Like Weininger, he was a degenerate, but he was a degenerate of a nobler sort. He was a Nietzschean woman, if I may employ the term — or, rather, his mentality was that of the overman, or superman, as he was one of the few men to whom the Nietzschean doctrine of the will to power was not an abstract idea, but a command, the fulfilment of which constituted a duty. Nietzsche was, in a word, a degenerate who had made the most of his opportunities. His physical infirmities were the occasion of his mental greatness. And that greatness found expression in a passionate love of all that was manly, and a passionate contempt for all that was womanly. In his eyes, to be womanly was to be weak, and weakness was always despicable, whether it was manifested in deed or in dress. His hatred of Weininger is easily explained. Weininger was a Jew, and Nietzsche had a profound, a fanatical hatred of the Jews. In the earlier half of his life he himself was a Jew, but he was a Jew without the Jewish instincts.	1911	2005.3207
"The Princess of Wales's Hospital, at Kensington, the largest in London, received its full share of patients, while the very few private hospitals which were left undisturbed were also filled to the doors. I learnt later that every church in the British Isles had been appealed to for linen and bandages, and that the appeal was answered most liberally. In the churches the wounded were received and tended by volunteers of both sexes, who did not spare themselves in their efforts to alleviate the pain and suffering of the unfortunate men. Though the battle in the north had ceased, the great struggle was still being maintained in the south, and it was therefore impossible to say how long the services of volunteers would be required. At Kensington I met a lady who had just come from the Princess of Wales's Hospital, and who told me that there was still great need of help. For weeks she had devoted her life to the care of the poor soldiers, and she said that other ladies of her acquaintance were doing the same. ""We cannot sit idly by in these terrible days, "" she said. ""We must do our share to help our brave men who are fighting for their country."" Later, I again made my way through the Park to the western part of London. The streets were almost deserted, but I saw a number of Red Cross wagons and horse ambulances, while at various points soldiers were stationed upon guard or were resting. At Kensington I went to the Princess of Wales's Hospital. It was the largest hospital in London, and received its full share of wounded every day."	1906	1875.8989
"Mr. McClure's analysis of Wilde's character is keen and searching. It is a masterly portraiture, drawn with a firm hand, and it is but just to say that Mr. McClure's own fine moral sense and clear insight are shown to advantage in the discussion. The chapter entitled ""The Bible of the Man of Earth"" is one of the most powerful and impressive in the book. It is a discussion of the philosophy of materialism as taught by the late John Dewey — a philosophy which Mr. McClure declares to be ""the Bible of the man of earth."" In the exposition of this materialistic philosophy, Mr. McClure has given us the most lucid and convincing argument against it that we have ever read. It is given in the form of an imaginary debate between a disciple of Dewey and a disciple of Christ. The disciple of Dewey argues that the only life of which we have any proof is the life of the body, and that the only consciousness we can ever know is the consciousness of the body. He teaches that the body is the sole source of knowledge, and that the mind is merely a function of the body. He argues that the body is the only reality, the only being, the only existence, and that the body is the only being of which we can ever have any knowledge. The disciple of Christ argues that the body, while the outward manifestation of the spirit, is not the reality, but the shadow of the reality, and that the spirit is the being, the existence, the consciousness of which we are aware."	1911	1926.1489
"They were all very good to him, and made him sit in the easiest chair, and brought him things, and gave him hot drinks. But he felt as if he were in a nightmare, and that he must wake and find himself in his own room at the "" Castle."" He could not think why his mother had allowed him to come down amongst them. It was very unkind of her. He told her so. ""My dear,"" she said, ""you are so much better. I could not let you sit alone upstairs and brood. Besides, we had to have you down to show you the new collar."" 226 ""Yes, the collar, the collar!"" he said impatiently. ""Where is it?"" ""You must wait, Paul, and have the real homecoming properly done,"" she answered. ""It is in the drawing room on the table. We are waiting for the clock to strike ten, and then we will all go in."" ""Ten o'clock!"" he said. ""I wish it was midnight. I wish I had never come home."" ""Paul!"" exclaimed his mother, shocked. ""You are very ungrateful."" ""No, I am not,"" he said. ""But I want to be alone with my Queen."" ""You shall, dear, after ten."" And so it happened that, at ten o'clock, Paul entered the drawing room, and there, on the table, was the collar — a marvel of art. It was a broad band of pure gold, very simple in design, with just one thing engraved on it — the word ""Queen"" in a beautiful old English script."	1909	1908.6598
"It is a curious situation. The directors of the National City Company are to be selected by the directors of the National City Bank. The president of the bank will be the president of the company, and the vice president of the bank will be the vice president of the holding company. The company will not be a subsidiary corporation of the bank, it is true; but there is no disguise about the close connection. The bank is to be the chief stockholder in the company, and the president of the bank is to be president of the company. It is a situation that would give rise to but one conclusion in a country where the banking business was not under the supervision of the government. And that conclusion would be that the holding company was a device by which the national banking law was being evaded. * * * As the law stands, the whole situation looks like a very serious weakening of the national banking law."" To this we may add that the Springfield Republican has not lost sight of the gravity of the situation, as indicated by the organisation of the First National Company, and it has been quick to voice its critical attitude toward the violation of the spirit of the laws which this new holding company by the First National Bank is an illustration. Thus in a recent issue it says: ""When the First National Bank of New York announces its intention to incorporate under the New Jersey law a company which is to be a holding company for financial and industrial corporations, its action may well provoke a serious discussion of the situation."	1911	1901.3414

When It has completed the task, we doubt whether it will be able to conform to the new and improved methods. When we see what paralysis, breakdown, and failure it has so far suffered from overviork, we are dubious of further expansion of the organ which is already too large and undeveloped for its work. We can conceive, even now, that its capacity, like that of other organs, will be diminished by use, and we resent this as we resent the mismanagement of the land, the results of which we see about us every day in the shape of slums and diseased and poverty stricken inhabitants. 6. It governs people for their own good, does it? What do the people say to that? What right has the State to go beyond self protection and interfere with liberty, however, mistaken, paternal, or malevolent? Liberty is a priceless heritage. It has been won by hard fighting. It is still being fought for by thousands in the world. We will have no more of a State which governs people for their own good. We will strive to build in the land the State which governs by consent, not by dogma, by voluntary association, not by compulsion; a State which will leave free scope to the individual and social initiative which has ever been the spring of social progress. To this end we will have no interference, however patronising, with our social life; and when we are told that such interference comes from a paternalism which is purely reactionary and conservative, and is, in fact, anti socialism, and that in this connection Socialism stands for Freedom, we heartily endorse the dictum.	1911	1922.2823
"His name was George Morton, and he was an inventor of some repute, his particular branch of invention being the construction of flying machines. He was sitting at the breakfast table in his pretty little villa at Norbury, and the person he was addressing was his only son, who was seventeen that birthday, and whose birthday it was also. The son was a lad of great promise, with a well proportioned, athletic figure, and a fair, boyish complexion. His features were rather like his father's, but they were softened by a certain boyish naivete and a look of frank enjoyment of life which his father lacked. "" Yes, I suppose it is, "" replied the boy, running his fingers through the close cropped hair which was one of the features that made him look so boyish. "" But I'm jolly glad I shall be of age."	1911	1889.3226
"39. Variations in Strength of similar Materials. — The strength of materials of the same kind varies greatly. For example, the tensile strength of cast iron may vary from 50 to 200 tonnes per square inch; while in the case of concrete made from the same materials, the variations in tensile strength reach from about 1 to 10 tonnes per square inch. The tensile strength of various materials is often represented graphically by a series of curves called ""striation curves."" These vary considerably in different localities, and it is therefore advisable to obtain a series for any particular locality in which it is proposed to undertake extensive building operations. A few such curves are shown in Fig. 240, and are taken from Prof. Hughes' ""Materials of Construction."" They refer to bricks made by several different makers in Glasgow, and the tensile strength of similar bricks varies within very wide limits, as is shown in this figure. Figs. 241 and 242 show similar curves giving the compressive strength of concrete made from different kinds of aggregate. Of course, the curves are of no direct use unless it is known what particular aggregate is meant on which to base the concrete. 40. Specific Gravity. — This is a property of great importance when considering natural building materials. When comparing different materials as holding substances it is necessary to bear in mind that, for equal volume, the strength of a material is greater as its specific gravity is greater."	1908	1922.1481
It is the modern Italian way of making a living. The man who does not belong to a cooperative society is a man without a job, and he knows it. He knows that he will be the last to be hired for any work that has to be done. And he knows, also, that he will be paid less for his labour than the man who belongs to a society. It is not a question of wages. It is a question of being in the game. Every Italian cooperative society has its headquarters in the town in which it is organised. There the members meet regularly to discuss the business in hand. Each man has a vote, and each man has a voice in the matter of the society's contracts.	1913	1936.0242
In his criticism of the utilitarianism of the day, Professor Santayana is at his best. Utilitarianism, he says, is based upon a mechanical theory of the universe and a metaphysical theory of the will. The mechanical theory is now abandoned by all the best thinkers. It is the theory of the universe as a collection of atoms in constant motion, and of the will as an atom thrown into motion by some other atom, and in turn throwing some other atom into motion. The utilitarianism of the day, however, still rests upon this theory, and is constantly appealing to the atomistic view of the universe. It is at this point that Professor Santayana's criticism is effective. In his view, the mechanical theory of the universe is now abandoned by all the best thinkers, and the utilitarianism of the day is at war with the highest philosophic tendencies. The utilitarianism of the day is also based upon a metaphysical theory of the will, which is equally abandoned by all the best thinkers. The will is an atom which chooses between two courses of action, and the utilitarianism of the day is based upon the assumption that the choice is determined by the greatest happiness principle. Now, the will is not an atom, and the greatest happiness principle has no place in the modern philosophy of ethics. Professor Santayana's position is that the moral sense is not the will, but a faculty of the mind, - the faculty of enjoyment.	1913	1942.9496
"I was strong and could do the work of two men, and that's what I did. And if it was hard, I didn't mind it, as long as my children was all right."" ""Aren't we all right, mama?"" asked a boy about fourteen years old, who had come in unnoticed, and now stood close to his mother's side. ""We are, aren't we?"" ""You are, and you always will be, if I have to die for you,"" she said, her tone changing from one of bitterness to tenderness. ""If I have to die for you!"" ""You ought to die for us!"" said a girl, about eleven, who entered behind the boy. ""You ought to die for us, and you ought to die for a good many others, too!"" ""Lize, you hush!"" commanded the mother, shaking her head as if to warn the child against any further speech."	1913	1926.1454
"There's compensation in all things, is there?"" she echoed. ""Then why are we going to be locked out of our homes, and why are we going to have to trudge about the streets like tramps in the middle of winter? Who's going to take us in, or take care of us? There's not much ' equal distribution of happiness ' about that, I think."" "" Dear, dear, Mrs. Sprott, I am afraid you will have to plead guilty to being a little too abstract in your ideas this morning, "" said Miss Pocock. "" It is so easy to arrive at the most unshakeable deductions upon the mere fringe of a question. We often talk about happiness being equally distributed, when we have but to look out into the world to see how few really happy people there are."" Mrs. Peppercorn made a sound which alarmed her neighbours at table. "" I can't and won't pretend to be abstract, "" she exclaimed. "" Here I am, like anyone else; here is Mr. Peppercorn, and there's our little income. We're not happy, and neither are we well off. We have to wear each thread of our clothes and each shoe for twice or thrice its time, to say nothing of our Sunday collars and cuffs. We can't afford to lay in a stock of health; we have to buy that at every moment as it happens to be convenient, and we don't have half enough."	1908	1899.0483
"ll I don't like that. To me the worst part of our government is that it is a government vf the people. I would like to escape from the tyranny of a democracy, were that possible in a democratic state. But what I want now is not free sufl'rage, but ""bad government."" My house is old, and I am going to have it repaired this summer. For a time I shall suffer from the disturbance such work causes; there will be unpleasant draughts, painty smells, and probably some rain will get into my house before it is kept out executely. But the repairs will add to my comfort formany years to come. And I endure the discomfort of the time because I am looking forward to the greater comfort of the years to come. Just so I suffer now from the discomfort of ""bad government, "" and shall suffer more before I enjoy the good, permanent results of the needed changes. I can't say just what we need, but we need a good deal of something. Let me look around at a few needs that are calling for immediate help or radical change: 1. We need more integrity in our public servants. I have no doubt, when I get on oily enough, that I can find a few presidential electors who will sell their votes."	1911	1889.1051

In the Southern states, however, the opposite is true and a slope to the south or southwest is preferred, as the trees then start earlier in the spring and mature their fruit better in the summer. For berries, a northeast slope is generally best in the South as well as in the North, because the early spring and summer sun is needed to keep the ground dry and to promote the growth of the plants. It is very important that the land be well drained, especially for the tree fruits. This is not so important for the small fruits, as they may be grown in rows or hills on the tops of ridges or on the sides of the hills where the drainage is good. But the tree fruits must have the entire field well drained or they may be injured by the water standing in the soil. In fact, many orchards have been ruined by the use of tile drains which were not placed deep enough or which were allowed to choke up and become useless. On this account, a soil which has a subsoil that is naturally impervious to water and which is too dense or too clayey to be artificially drained is not well adapted to fruit growing. A soil that is too sandy to retain moisture and that needs constant irrigation is also unsuited to fruit growing. A soil that is well adapted to fruit growing has a surface soil that is deep, rich, mellow, and well supplied with humus and a subsoil that is loose, porous, and well drained, and one that will retain enough moisture to furnish a constant supply to the roots.	1914	1916.6259
This presumption was in fact strengthened by the work of Cuvier, who, as we have seen, demonstrated the reality of catastrophes, and hence of the necessity of limiting the application of the principle of continuity and of the doctrine of gradual evolution. The general acceptance of the creationist view of species, which this Buffonian criterion of species tended to foster, was also furthered by the idea of a special creation of the organisms of the different groups and subgroups of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. This idea was rendered plausible by the general belief in the fixity of the types of the vertebrate and invertebrate phyla — a belief which was based on the embryological observations of Meckel, 1 1 1 and which was strengthened by Cuvier's demonstration of the reality of the four great plans of organisation. The conception of a special creation of groups of species, which are now called genera, was favoured by the fact that, as I have shown in the previous chapter, the Buffonian view of the origin of the domestic animals was in accord with the idea of a special creation of genera. So that although Buffon himself was an evolutionist, his doctrine of the origin of the domestic animals, which was based on the variability of individuals, was in harmony with the view that the genera of the animal kingdom are not only natural entities, but also special creations.	1911	1926.4348
The diameter of the fan is 8 feet, and its circumferential speed at the tips is 3,600 feet per minute. The fan is so arranged that the air enters it axially and is discharged radially. The wind produced by the fan is shown in Fig. 2. The direction of the arrows indicates the direction of the wind. The area of the working portion of the channel is 4 square feet, and the area of the discharge from the fan is 36 square feet, so that the velocity of the wind from the fan is only 1/9th of the velocity of the air entering the working portion of the channel.

"137 ""God and the angels are the only ones who know when I am to die."" And he turned away, waving his hand. He shook his head in reply to all further questions and suggestions concerning the matter, and went out to compose himself in the garden. The news that Peter Schwarz was going to die on the twenty-third of September was soon spread through the community. Most of the people made light of it, but among the older and more seriously inclined it was regarded as a thing not to be trifled with. People spoke of it in whispers on the street. In the prayer meetings some bright lady suggested the health of Mr. Schwarz and his family as a special unmentioned petition, but one of the deacons dismissed the idea."	1913	1913.8336

"In January, 1775, he appears in a little farce, Les Visitantes, in which he is the author of one of the two roles, the other being filled by the Marquis de Marmontel.^ As a fact, Le Texier was an excellent actor, as few of those who have seen him perform in any of the roles which he filled will deny. 1 Cormenin, Une Vie de Voltaire, p. 482. 1 Deux ans de comedic 4 Ferney, p. 174. 7 After the departure of the royal court Le Texier returned to the Théâtre-Français, where he played in Madame de Genlis' Adelaïde du Guesclin, December 7, 1776. On January 2nd, 1777, he reappears on the stage of the Comédie Française in the title role of Bazire, a vaudeville by Louis de Boissy. It is said that though the piece was inept and the acting poor, Le Texier succeeded in charming people by one thing — his eyes. These, which had at one time been so beautiful, were now, alas ! his only remaining physical advantage. His countenance, which had been so fine, was ugly; his nose was no longer straight, and the white hair which fell over his shoulders was not a mark of glory.

Paris green is poisonous and should not be used on fruits that are to be eaten until after the first rain. London Purple: London purple, 1 pound. Water, 50 gallons. Mix as above. This is also poisonous. White Hellebore: White hellebore, 1 ounce. Water, 1 gallon. This is used for currant worms and rose slugs. Kerosene Emulsion: Kerosene, 1 pint. Soap, 1 ounce. Water, 1 gallon. Dissolve the soap in the water and while hot add the kerosene. Mix by pouring back and forth from one vessel to another until it becomes a creamy emulsion.	1914	1911.8949
"The Old Man and the Sea. By Ernest Hemingway. (Hogarth Press, 7s. 6d. net.) 1 HE old man at the beginning of Mr. Hemingway's story is over eighty and has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. He is a Cuban fisherman, poor and lonely, but with a fine spirit, and a boy who loves him. The boy's parents have forbidden him to fish with the old man, but he loves him too well to leave him altogether. So he goes to the old man's hut and helps him, and carries his gear and his lines and his sail to the sea. And when the old man catches a great fish, and it is torn to pieces by sharks, he goes home and sleeps, ""the boy lying close to him in the terrible old man's shack."" It is a simple story, simply told, and like all Mr. Hemingway's work, it is full of the beauty of the world. The Last Tramp. By John Galsworthy. (Duckworth, 2s. 6d. net.) T^HESE two stories are full of Mr. Galsworthy's deep and tender sympathy with the downtrodden and the lost. The first, ""The Last Tramp, "" is the story of a poor, old, broken man who has been a ""tramp"" all his life."	1913	1932.774
He has always had a great respect for you, and when he was in France, he spoke to me often of your kindness to him. He is a man of letters, and one of our most illustrious musicians. If you would have the goodness to facilitate his task by giving him some details of your life, your career, and your works, he would be eternally grateful to you. I have no doubt that you will wish to reward my friendship by obliging my friend, and that you will excuse my presumption in making this request to you. I should have a thousand regrets if I had gone to England and had not been able to speak to you of my friend, whose worth I wish to make known to you.	1912	1888.5468
The transverse shape was a continuation of the keel line, and the models might be described as having the full forms of a flsh, tapering of gradually toward the stem and the stern. It is probable that a somewhat concave shape of the sides, sweeping out to the top, as in model No. 17, would be a little more efficient than the present forms, and after testing models Nos. 17 and 30 it is likely that a side shape of model No. 17, with the bottom of model No. 30, would give a model possessing very good qualities. In this connection it should be remarked that the main object of developing a shape of broad beam and flat bottom was to provide for good seaworthy qualities in a single embodiment.	1912	1907.2394
The city itself is high on a granite mount, which seems to rise to the sky from the plain as a tower rises from a castle; and it is surrounded by walls, which were first Celtic, then Roman, then Moorish, and finally Christian. The Moors added the most to the walls, and they are the most beautiful and picturesque part of them; but the Christians finished them with a severity which has its own beauty. The city is entered through gates with the emblems of the Catholic kings, and the walls are crenellated in the fashion of Christian fortifications. The castle which tops the rock was originally Celtic, and later Roman, and later still Moorish. It was at last converted into a monastery by Ferdinand and Isabella, who were born in the neighbouring city of Cuidad Real, and whose mausoleum at Granada is the most beautiful thing in Spain. In this monastery Columbus came to lay his plans for the discovery of America before his sovereigns, and here he returned after the discovery, to be received with the highest honour. The castle has a fine garden, with a fountain in the centre, and a shady walk of orange trees, and its terraces give the best view of the city and the surrounding country. It has also a chapel, where the altar is adorned with the sword of El Cid; but the sainted sword was not the most interesting thing in the chapel to me. That was a glass case full of the swords and shields, and helmets and breastplates of the knights who fought in the famous jousts of the Moorish Spain and the Christian. They were all of gold and silver, and enamelled with gay colours, and inlaid with jewels, and burnished till they shone like the sun.	1913	1861.0991
""" If you would only be quiet, "" said Marcia, with a kind of impatience. "" You are making my head ache, and I cannot listen to you. I will go and find my father."" And she moved towards the door. Mrs. Bets sprang after her and caught her dress. "" Don't — don't do that ! He will be angry with me — and I can't bear that ! Oh, dear — oh, dear — what am I to do!"" Marcia turned upon her. "" You are not a child, "" she said, "" and you are behaving like one. If you want to speak to me, speak. If you want to cry, go away and cry. I will not have you making my head ache by doing both at once."" Mrs. Bets dropped her hand, and Marcia went back to her chair, though she was angry with herself for having done so. "" I was — I was foolish, "" said Mrs. Bets, trying to regain something of her former calmness, and wiping her eyes and her nose with the same operation. "" But oh, dear, I am so frightened — so frightened ! My son — my son — my son — oh, dear, what will become of him!"" "" I will send for my father, "" said Marcia again."	1913	1911.7975
"Darby, in the person of Mr. George Wyndham, is determined that England shall be strong. Joan, in the person of Lady D'Abernon, says it is not necessary to spend money on forts at Dover, which, after all, are "" merely a fussy sort of barrier to the Channel tunnel."" The Darby and Joan are not in harmony: but the cartoon is not merely a pictorial illustration of the cartoonist's opinions. It is a warning, too, to Mr. Wyndham. The forts at Dover are not the only "" fussy "" things that are being done in the name of Imperial Defence. There is a great deal being done that is not fussy. The great work of Imperial Federation, for example, is not fussy. But there is a great deal of fussy legislation about Home Rule, and so on. There is no doubt which of the two is more needed, and it is just possible that Mr. Wyndham may consider Mr. Balfour's AntiHome Rule Bill and the other "" fussy "" legislation that is being introduced, more important than the forts at Dover. We have spoken of the cartoonist who is a teacher. There is another who is a prophet, and who can, when he chooses, give a lesson as well as prophesy. This is Mr. Charles Dana Gibson, whose cartoons, as we have said, are not only amusing, but full of serious meaning."	1911	1918.3965

It is well, however, to secure seeds from the best and hardiest sorts and to plant them where they will produce healthy and vigorous seedlings for use. (b) Johnny apple sedgs are commonly planted in a nursery row to produce stocks for grafting. As this strain runs somewhat smaller than ordinary seedlings, some prefer to grow extra nursery rows and to select the stocks to be cut down for grafting according to their size — large or small. Choice seeds are said to produce seedlings which are a little nearer uniform. The trees produced from these seedlings tend to be more uniform than from unselected seeds, but in either case trees from seedlings vary greatly as to different qualities. (c) Pear seedlings are much used as stocks for dwarfing. They are wintered in the cellar and in the spring they are forced into growth; then buds of the apple are inserted into the shoots which are to go above ground. Stocks of many sorts have been tried for the apple, but so far pear stocks are the only ones which give any general satisfaction. They do produce dwarf trees and trees on which the apples have different tastes and qualities, but such stocks are still far from ideal. Effects of Different Stocks: (a) As a rule, five or six years is required for the apple on seedling stocks to bear fruit, but a few varieties are precocious even under these conditions.	1914	1930.4735
One more bit of advice and I am through. When out on a trip to get pictures, take a good supply of plates or films, and don't economise. It's better to have a few spoiled than to miss a good picture because you had only one plate left. If you have to cut your trip short because you have run out of films, you may be sure that there are plenty of good pictures around which you could have had if you had been able to stay longer. But, on the other hand, don't take along too many. I have known men to have a box of films packed away so securely that they didn't know where it was, and so couldn't use it if they wanted to.	1912	1954.16

THE SINKING OF THE SHARON Rose In his essay on the Shipwreck, Stevensonsays: ""It is, I suppose, the greatest of all misfortunes, after the loss of a child, to sink at sea, and perhaps, at that, the least alarming; theory that is to say disappears in the face of practical experience. The second day the bodies swayed like a kelp bed; the third we saw a fish feeding on the eyes of one; on the fourth we rose, a phantom, from the surface."" T HE SINKING OF THE SHARON ROSE IN the morning of May 2, 1910, the British steamship Sharon Rose was proceeding . on an ordinary voyage from Ancona to Alythus. As the story of the disaster, as told by the captain, who was saved, is one of the most remarkable of the many interesting accounts of shipwreck, it is here reproduced in its entirety. The morning was warm and the sea smooth, but at noon a light haze drove down from the northward and by midday the wind had increased to a gale, with driving rain and a very heavy sea. By this time we were off the northern entrance to the Dardanelles, and my first action was to alter course to the northeast, so as to take the sea on the starboard quarter."	1913	1907.5206

"""Are you going to leave me ?"" she asked, stricken. ""Yes. I CAN prove it — I can'T tell you — but I CAN prove it."" He opened the door. ""How?"" ""By keeping my word."" He went out and closed the door. She stood for a little time where he had left her, her hand on the mantelpiece, her face pale. Then, her back straightening, she went across the room and opened the door that led to his laboratory. The doorknob fell from her hand. Her sexual instinct, the impulse which makes a woman step backward even though she hears the steps behind her, lent her the strength to enter. They were all there: the great, white, grotesque-skinned man on the centre table, the two piggish men in the chair, the spare, quarrelsome little man against the wall, and the other, iron faced and sullen, who tried to read upon the table his newspaper, rendered illegible with many finger marks. The little grey monkey, looking almost black under its oil lamp, stuck its head above the edge of the table. But they were silent.

A municipality possesses certain powers of government which may arise from its char ter, from general statutes applicable to all cities or to certain classes of cities, and from special powers conferred by the legislature. In Wisconsin it is provided: ""A city may sue and be sued, subject to the provisions of its charter respecting suits.”"" In respect to the power to incur indebtedness, Wisconsin has adopted a provision common to many states: ""No city, village, or town shall incur any indebtedness or liability, except for current expenses, to exceed in any year the income and revenue for such year, unless the same is, by a vote of three fourths of the members elect of such city, village, or town, authorized to be incurred, at a legal meeting thereof.""“ Various debts or liabilities have not been held to constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of this provision. For example, an existing debt due by a municipality to a judgment creditor, though unprovided for by the budget, does not of itself constitute an ""indebtedness"" within the meaning of the Wisconsin provision requiring a four fifths vote for its incurring."	1913	1848.6825
To one who has had a taste of the joys of such outings as that to a summer resort, with its crowded streets, shops and hotels, with its merry throngs enjoying the pleasures offered by the place, the real charm of the picture lies in the suggestion it gives of the happy time passed there. And yet, because of the custom of posing for the camera, such pictures are apt to be valueless from this standpoint. The camera fiend wanders about and sees something that interests him, he snaps it. But the something that is of the greatest interest to him, the something that will mean the most to him at all times, is the scene around the hotel door, the people with whom he spent that summer in the little cove, the gang that enjoyed the fishing trip together.	1912	1938.2614
An arrangement like this is, however, not pleasing. The lamps should be spaced at a distance apart equal to their height above the platform, if the lamps are placed at a height of 12 ft. above the platform, and spaced at a distance of 12 ft. apart, each lamp should give 400 c. p. at 20 degrees if placed in the centre of the row, to give the same average illumination over the platform. But as a matter of fact the lamps are placed about 10 ft. from the edge of the platform, and the spacing is rather greater than 12 ft. apart, and the lamps are placed 12 ft. above the platform. It is not, however, the average illumination over the platform which is of the first importance, but the edge illumination, and this is very uneven. As a matter of fact, it is the practice in the best theatres to have a row of lamps over the proscenium arch and columns of lamps at intervals in the stage house. It is very difficult to give any mathematical expression for the distribution of illumination obtained, for the lamps are not of the same candle power, the reflectors and diffusing glass are not the same, and the lamps are not all at the same height above the platform. An approximate idea may, however, be obtained by considering the distribution of illumination from a single lamp.	1912	1875.7958
He is now employed by a large firm in the North of England, and is making rapid progress in his profession. I am very proud of him, and often write to him, to tell him so. I am sure he will one day be at the head of the business in which he is engaged. He has a great aptitude for dealing with machinery, and inventing new ways of improving it. It is by no means an unusual thing for him to be called upon to give his opinion with regard to some new invention, and many of his ideas have already been patented and brought into general use. He is now engaged on a scheme of his own, and I have no doubt that it will prove a great boon to the world when he has brought it to perfection.	1911	1867.5411
The teaching of the Buddha, which had spread over the Indian subcontinent and attained to an extraordinary degree of intensity, is a case in point.

He then compared the two photographs. Now, while this is a very good method for determining the colour rendering power of an illuminant, it has certain drawbacks. In the first place, the sensitiveness of the photographic plate is not equal to that of the human eye in different parts of the spectrum, and so the results are not quite fair. In the second place, the method is a somewhat lengthy one, and is not so easily applied to the determination of small differences in the colour of two illuminants. I have therefore devised a method which I think is a great improvement on that just mentioned. I have constructed a colour box, which is a very simple piece of apparatus, and can be made by anyone in a few hours. The box is of wood, and has six sides. The side A is a piece of plate glass, and the side B is a piece of ground glass, which can be painted any colour.	1912	1894.6749
Now, I have not scrupled to bring forward the very latest pronouncement of this author, for I have no desire to conceal anything from my readers. I have found that what I have to say is confirmed by the experience of writers whose views I have only just discovered, and with whom I have no other concern than that of a reader. No one, I am sure, will accuse me of being actuated by a desire to enlist recruits for the opposite camp. I am the last person to wish to increase the numbers of those who belong to the no — sect, and who have no belief in the power of the human mind to regenerate itself. I am not concerned to win over to my way of thinking those who are so fortunate as to possess a religious sense. I should not wish to deprive them of their inheritance. I am only anxious to make it clear to those who have not this sixth sense that they are not necessarily shut out from the Kingdom of Heaven. The only argument to which I care to listen is that which is founded on experience. It is for this reason that I have gone into the matter so fully. I have been told that the Gods are dead, and I have been told that the Christian God is very much alive. I have been told that my spiritual welfare is in jeopardy.	1911	1868.3424
list system, are two. One is that it is more complicated and therefore less intelligible to the average voter. The other is that, if it is to be applied to more than one vacancy, different ballots may have to be counted for different candidates, because each candidate is to be elected with as small a number of votes as possible. This means that the ballots must first be sorted according to the candidates and then counted successively for each candidate, beginning with the one lowest in votes, until he has received enough votes to elect him, and then for the next lowest, and so on. The counting is complicated, but not unduly so considering the great advantages gained. The necessity of sorting the ballots according to candidates is a disadvantage, because it makes it impossible to apply the Hare rules to the counting of the primary elections of the parties that are to use the system in the general election.	1914	1904.9937
But the British battleships had not yet come into action. The Invincible was in command, and she ordered the Queen Mary to go after the German cruisers and keep them in sight, while the rest of the squadron turned to the rescue of the crippled light cruiser. The Queen Mary started obediently on her errand, but the German cruisers had already disappeared from the field of action, and the British battleships wheeled to the east, where the Edinburgh Castle had beached herself in a final act of defiance. The Germans made off at their best speed, and were not again seen. The German light cruisers were, of course, heavily outgunned and outclassed in every way by the British First Cruiser Squadron. But they had performed a remarkable feat. They had actually engaged and for a time held in check the British First Cruiser Squadron, which had been despatched in search of them.	1906	1912.2484
He was a man of the world, and loved the world, and the things of the world, and his heart was full of the pride of life. He had always taken a pride in the things he had been able to do with his own hands, and in the things he had been able to buy with his money, and in the things he had been able to get others to do for him. He was an accomplished and well bred man, and he had a good deal of that knowledge of the world which can only be gained by a constant mixing with the people of all classes who inhabit it. His manners were perfect, and, as a rule, so were his morals; but his manners were by far the more flexible of the two, for in them he had been trained to perfection, while he had never taken the trouble to train his conscience.	1908	1898.3638

""" All right."" Wickett turned and faced the young woman who had been at his elbow. "" I have to report, Mrs. Captain, that the ship is ready for sea, and that the — "" "" Oh, I know. Taps. I've heard it before."" She turned and walked away, and Wickett continued: "" I got a new idea about the navy on that cruise. I was with a bunch of young fellows who were just as enthusiastic about the service as were the young fellows with whom I had cruised many years before. I was amazed at their esprit de corps, their love of the service, and their loyalty to their superiors. I was ashamed of myself. I felt like a disloyal old man. I kept wondering what had happened to me, and I finally decided that it was because I had been assigned to the command of a monitor. I had been too long away from what I had always thought was the real navy — the battleships. I had forgotten that even monitors have their place in the service. But I was reminded of it in a most impressive manner by a young ensign who had been one of my junior officers on that last cruise. I was on my way to the naval academy to lecture to the midshipmen on the subject of ' The Monitor and Her Place in the Navy.'"	1913	1913.2156
A few moments later his curiosity was satisfied. The carriage rolled on swiftly, and whenever it stopped at a crossing or at a street corner, the old gentleman leaned forward and peered eagerly out at the passers — as though he expected to see some one whom he did not wish to meet. His countenance was unusually pale, and his eyes flashed with a feverish brightness. The time for speech had not yet come when the carriage drew up before the entrance of a large building in a quiet street, and the old gentleman opened the door and stepped out in the same way as he had done the day before. This time there was no footman in sight, and the Herr just glanced to the right and left, to see that no one was near, then, opening a small porte- monnaie, he took from it a small metallic object and attached it to the knob of the door.	1913	1906.6346
His father had been the Bishop of Wells, a man of real spiritual insight, and of a certain moral magnificence which was not untainted by vanity. He had shone for a few years as a leader of the Tractarian movement. But he had been forced to resign his see through a refusal to take the oaths of allegiance to the Crown. This had been the result of a long and violent struggle to recover for the Church her lost temporal power in the State. He ended his days in the quiet of a small country parsonage, where he was worshipped by his parishioners as a saint. His wife had been the daughter of a Jacobite peer, an Irish earl, and her whole family had been connected with the Jacobite movement. She was a woman of a proud and melancholy nature, and her early life had been overshadowed by the flight of her brother to France, where he died in poverty and obscurity, a victim of political proscription.	1913	1895.6127

— At the time of the tests reported on here, it was thought that this work would be of interest and value, and a special device (No. 14) was constructed for it. This device is shown in Fig. 6. It has a skid strut (the vertical part of the device) and two wing struts (the inclined parts), and these are all one piece. The fineness ratio varies from 3*8 to about 12*3, and the part of the device devoted to this work was supported at each end of this strut by a horizontal arm, which allowed the strut to be placed at any angle up to 15° to the horizontal plane. The drift, lift, and speed variation tests were made with the device at various angles of inclination to the wind. The preliminary study of the results (the final study has not yet been made) leads to the conclusion that there is little practical advantage to be gained at the moderate angles of inclination which are probably met with in aviation, by introducing inclined struts instead of wing struts to support	1912	1912.7084
The money trust was now in complete control. It had succeeded in having the Secretary of the Treasury redeem the silver notes in gold, and it had succeeded in having the purchasing clause of the Sherman bill repealed. It was only necessary now to have the government bond issues renewed, in order that the banks might be able to control the gold reserve. It was for this purpose that the bond issue of 1895 was negotiated. These bonds were sold to private bankers at a price which yielded the government only a small percentage of the face value of the bonds. The balance was made up by the banks charging a large premium on the gold which they sold to the government. This bond issue was negotiated without the knowledge or consent of Congress, and was never submitted to Congress for approval.	1911	1917.6879
"""Drop it!"" commanded Peter, and the dog dropped it. It was a woman's hat, and the dog, who was called ""Stain,"" had stained it with blood and mud and teeth. ""Well, I guess that's the end of that, anyhow!"" said Peter. ""I wish I could get a chance to thank Miss Van Der Windt for her kindness to me, Stain."" The dog looked up at him and wagged his tail, and while Peter was considering whether to take the hat to the town and give it to a livery stable keeper, who was the only person in Cleveland whom he knew, or to leave it where it was, Stain made up his mind for him. He picked up the hat and trotted off down the road with it, and Peter, with a shrug of his shoulders, followed. Stain took the hat to the door of a log cabin on the outskirts of Cleveland, and Peter, who was not sorry to have his errand made for him, knocked at the door. A young woman opened it. She was very good looking, but she had a weary, frightened look, and her dress was patched and stained, and she seemed to be about to cry. ""I beg your pardon, "" said Peter, ""but my dog found this hat in the woods, and I thought it might belong to you or to some one in your family."""	1913	1922.4425
"h, it is good to see the time, "" exclaimed his Excellency, addressing the gentleman who stood beside him. ""Are we to have more rain?"" and he walked to the window, a long, slim man, smartly dressed in a well cut uniform of field marshal. He was von Kronhelm. ""I fear so,"" was the reply of the genial, grey haired man, who from his broad shoulders and close iron grey hair looked more like a soldier than a diplomatist. He was Sir John Marbridge, the Ambassador to the German Empire. ""It is unfortunate, your Excellency, that I am unable to say a few more words before the final act of our great dramatic performance is enacted; nevertheless, I am glad that the curtain is about to rise upon the last scene, "" said von Kronhelm, who could not conceal his impatience."	1906	1918.065
By way of diverting my mind a little, I went down to the Pantheon Gardens in the afternoon. I had not been in them for nearly a week, and I was pleased to find that they are still tolerably well filled with people. I met a few acquaintances, and among others, the Countess of Alnwick, a dark and clever looking woman, who was lady in waiting to the Princess of Wales when she first came to England. I had a little conversation with her, and was struck with her cold, penetrating eyes. She has a calm self possession which I admire. The grandeur, or at least the display, of life goes on uninterruptedly in St. Petersburg. The other day I saw the Grand Duke Michael, son of Alexander III., with some members of his family, driving on the Nevsky prospect, in an open carriage drawn by four horses, which were gaily caparisoned. The coachmen, too, were dressed in white and gold. The Grand Duchess looked quite happy, as did her children, who are all so vigorous and handsome. I do not think that their pale, delicate mother, the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, will live for very many years. 152  I have seen her only twice since her return to St. Petersburg, and on both occasions she looked ill and tired.

During the pupping season he changes his colour, becoming very light, from being very dark, and the hair on his head, chest and fore legs, becomes short, and some of it is shed off, while the hair on the hind legs is long and shaggy. At other seasons the colour is darkish brown, excepting the legs, which are of almond colour. The cows have no such change. They seem to have a grand ball or romp once a day, and will chase one another for half an hour at a time up and down the beach and over the rocks, and in the water for miles, without seeming to tire. It is a grand sight, and one that can hardly be described. They have also a grand powwow at the time of the full moon at night, and make a great noise, both in the water and on the land.	1909	1885.8295
It marks the conclusion of the first stage of the Long War. Up to that moment the fighting had proceeded upon more or less equal terms. The Royalists had had the advantage; the Roundheads were being beaten in detail. But at Nantwich the tide turned. The Roundheads had now the Scotch at their side, and from that day forward the Royalist strength, even if unbroken, was practically impotent. The position was this. England had declared for the revolt of the Netherlands, and as early as 1584 had made an active alliance with Holland. The Dutch had been the first to help the Puritan cause, and their ships had carried the bulk of the Parliamentary army across the seas to the relief of the Scots. The Scots were now under the command of the Prince of Orange, and the first campaign of the Long War had freed the whole of the North from all Royalist troops. The Scots now remained in England under the command of the Earl of Leven, and with them were eight thousand horse and foot under the immediate command of the Prince of Orange. Not only was the whole Northern and Midland counties freed from Royalist troops, but the Long Parliament now represented the whole of the English race, the whole of the English power. I have pointed out that by the second of the two events of January 25, 1644, the Royalist strength, even if unbroken, was practically impotent.	1912	1899.4989
The results will be published in detail later. In addition to the above, a series of tests has been made to determine the effect of increasing the slip, i.e. the ratio of the difference between the speed of the ship and the speed of the water to the speed of the water. For each value of the slip ratio, five values of the thrust have been taken, the corresponding values of the external power being also determined. Thus a number of thrust — power curves were obtained, each corresponding to a different value of the slip ratio. These curves have been plotted, and the area between the corresponding pair of curves (i.e. that lying to the left of the one corresponding to the given value of the slip ratio) has been separated, giving the work done by the water per second.	1912	1918.9948
"In this naive life experience we do not ask why something is present in our mind, and why something else is absent. We do not ask why we feel pain now and delight later on, and we do not ask why we feel the one kind of pain rather than the other. But as soon as we begin to demand an explanation of our mental life, we have to turn to the twofold aspect of our mental activity, and we have to ask, not only why something is there, but also why it is the way it is. And now we have to refer to the brain as the only objective reality which we can take as a basis for our explanations. If we could take some other reality, we would, of course, take it, and we would not take the brain. But we can take only the brain. And we can take it not as something material, which is to be put in opposition to the mental facts, but as something real, which serves as a basis for our explanation. This warning is all the more necessary, as we find the misunderstanding quite often. The view of psychology which we have outlined is sometimes called the ""psychological parallelism."" This is a misnomer. Parallelism suggests a mere parallel course of two realities, and it suggests an explanation by the assumption of a common third, which is not stated."	1909	1972.8958
The second great expansion of museum work, which is of equal importance, is the establishment of research laboratories. I have already pointed out that museums are at the present moment the only institutions in America where research is being actively carried on in biology. The U. S. National Museum has a few laboratories, but only a few, and they are open to outsiders on the same basis as similar laboratories in other institutions, and are not run by the Museum at all. The great biological laboratories of the U. S. Fish Commission, the Bureau of Plant Industry, the Bureau of Animal Industry, and the Bureau of Chemistry are not under the National Museum at all, but are maintained by these separate commissions. The only laboratories maintained by the National Museum are the geological laboratories of the U. S. Geological Survey, and these are maintained by the Survey and not by the Museum. In the Smithsonian Institution, aside from the National Museum, there are no research laboratories at all. The Bureau of Standards has a few laboratories, but they are not under the Smithsonian. The only biological laboratories under the National Museum are those of the Division of Pathology, which are maintained for the study of animal diseases, and which are under the Bureau of Animal Industry. All other divisions of the U. S. National Museum have no laboratories whatever. But even the laboratories of the Division of Pathology are largely used for routine work, and but little research is carried on in them.	1911	1940.8987
This blackberry is not hardy in the North. The high bush blackberries are not hardy throughout the state. The Snyder and the Dewberry are the hardiest and will succeed in the northern parts of the state. The Kittatinny and Ancient Briton are hardy in the central part and the Wilson and Rathburn in the southern part. The blackberries make a stronger growth and produce larger berries than the raspberries. The canes live through the winter and bear on the second year, so that two crops are always in the field at one time. The canes for the first year’s crop may be cut or trimmed back in the spring, while the canes for the second year’s crop are cut back in the fall or spring after the crop is gathered.	1914	1955.0308

The Wages Boards Acts of Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania, and the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Acts of New Zealand, are all framed to secure the same end, viz., the establishment of fair and reasonable wages and conditions of work in the various industries of the country, and though differing in some details, the Acts are sufficiently alike to admit of their being dealt with together. In Victoria and New South Wales, where the Wages Boards Acts are in force, the Boards have no power to fix hours of work, but may fix the rate of wages, and determine the conditions of work. In Tasmania, on the other hand, the Wages Boards may fix both wages and hours, and in this respect they are similar to the Boards established by the New Zealand Acts.	1908	1867.8862
The bank was established in July, 1896, and had paid out at the end of May, 1900, when the workmen first went on strike, a total of five hundred and fifty thousand dollars. This is equivalent to a little more than one thousand dollars for each of the two hundred workmen. The amount they received at the end of May this year was a little over one hundred and five thousand dollars. In the first two years they received about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or proportionately one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars a year, with an average of six hundred and twenty-five dollars for each workman. In the four years their average amount received a year has been one hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars.	1913	1909.8728
"But I won t take up any more of your time with my foolish notions. Let us hear what our friend from America has to say. It will at least give us food for thought. Yours, temporarily, Judith. (6) A Letter from Mr. Schvan. "" Judith, "" I have read much of Steinweg s article and it has awakened in me thoughts in line with your own. I have two questions to put. First, is love in its highest form, mutual? And secondly, if love without response is not love, what is it? I have studied this matter deeply and have been led to an understanding that satisfies my reason and my feelings. I will try to make you see it too. First, then, it is my firm belief that love in its highest form must be mutual. Perhaps in a life so boisterous as mine it is impossible for me to see things from any other point of view than my own. Certainly I have no time for introspection. But I cannot help thinking that the highest love is kindred love, — love that loves back. I suppose when I look into my heart for an instance of unreciprocated love that equals and exalts itself the answer is the love of my mother. Yet even there I have my doubts. I think my mother loves me back over and over again all I give her in love."	1911	1920.5945
"As a rule, gas is conducted to the consumers in the same way that it is transmitted from the gasworks to the main distributing station. But sometimes there are intermediate pressure stations, which take a high pressure gas from the main, and reduce the pressure before distributing it through the lower mains. THE MEASUREMENT OF GAS Gas is measured as it is supplied to the consumer, and the meter is usually placed in the house or place of business. The best form is that known as the ""rotary "" meter, which is especially suited for high pressure gas. It consists of two cylinders, one revolving inside the other, the gas entering at both ends, flowing round through passages formed by the walls of the drums and the lobes which divide the drum into compartments."	1912	1900.1018
The truth is, I believe, that the personal relations of the two creeds are friendly, that the Mahomedans are not hostile to the Nationalist movement, and that the belief in their hostility is due to the same misconceptions and the same exaggerations as those which I have just mentioned. It is a fact that the Mahomedans in Bengal are not Nationalists; but it is a fact, also, that the Mahomedans in the Punjab are Nationalists. The difference is largely due to the influence of the British Government in the different provinces. In Bengal, where the British Government, for reasons which every one understands, is identified with the anti-Nationalist reaction, the Mahomedans are anti-Nationalist; in the Punjab, where the British Government is identified with the Nationalist movement, the Mahomedans are Nationalists.	1908	1884.6884
"Among the most notable of the serious plays of the season is ""Under Sentence, "" by William C. De Mille, at the Lyceum, which is in the main a study of character. The plot is slight, and in one or two places is forced, but the action is interesting, and the dialogue is clever and often epigrammatic. The audience is kept in a state of suspense throughout to learn how the situation will be met by the different characters. The play opens in the apartment of a wealthy New Yorker, who is entertaining a young woman, a visitor from the country. The man is a life prisoner, under sentence for murder, who has escaped from jail. He has made his home in the apartment, which is furnished to represent a bachelor's quarters, and when he has finished his story of the crime and its motive, he proposes that the girl live with him as his wife. She is horrified. When she has left him, a young New Yorker, a friend of the girl, comes to the apartment, and under the impression that the man is a bachelor, proposes that he should marry the girl. The man shows the young man the law which he has made for himself, and which he has worked out to a system. ""I have no right to break the law, "" he says. ""You are a fool, "" replies the young man."	1911	1905.9094
The laugh rang out and startled many. It astonished Frederick himself. He had not intended to laugh. He had been in a brown study, and had not even been conscious of the fact that he was in a crowd. Now he was the centre of a dozen staring faces, some of which were angry, some horrified, some merely curious. He was the only person in sight who was not bent against the wind. He was the only person apparently uninjured by the weather. A woman with a child in her arms screamed. Frederick turned and fled, feeling like a lunatic. He was conscious that the crowd was now a mob, and that the mob had been aroused to fury by his action. He ran blindly, and the mob ran blindly after him. He flew down the street, and they flew down the street after him, shouting.	1913	1930.1691
""" Yes, yes, Mrs. Tovey, "" said Mrs. Peppercorn, impatiently; "" I'M not disputing that. He was very good at keeping his own health, and very particular about his food and exercise, and I suppose that's why he lived to such an age; but his complexion didn't dazzle me, and I was always quite sure there was nothing very remarkable about it. I never saw it close, it's true, but I saw it through a window once or twice, and I thought it looked too much like a mask, and as if it had been painted. I'M sure he took a lot of trouble with it."" "" He took a lot of trouble with everything, "" said Miss Tovey, who was not to be drawn into a disparagement of her dead pastor. "" Yes, that I'M sure of, "" said Mrs. Peppercorn; "" and that was one reason why I didn't want him for a neighbour.

I suppose the new vicar will be a gardener, too, and I'Ll have to suffer the same annoyance."" "" But he won't have the same garden to potter about in, "" said Miss Tovey, with a smile. "" No, I'M thankful for that, "" said Mrs. Peppercorn, "" though he might come into mine if he wanted to, for I'M sure I'Ve got no time to waste over it."	1908	1877.1088
And, strange to say, the very lack of modern prosaic comforts has developed a spirit of contentment, which has been a strong factor in the happiness of the life in the land. At the present day the majority of the better classes may be said to have a certain amount of what may be called ' modern culture, ' and it is the home of these people that is the most attractive and pleasant to the Christian worker who is here for a time. These people are often called ' Chinkies ' by the Americans and ' Sesh ' or ' Secesh ' by the Southerners. The first name is a corruption of ' Chinese, ' and originated in the war with Japan. The Southern name comes from their supposed sympathy with secession in the war between the States. Owing to their difference in customs and mode of life they are liable to have their life divided into two distinct parts — the Chinese and the English. The women, almost without exception, live a life of seclusion and never visit Europe or America, and many of the men do not care to do so, their business life lying all within the land. The chief feature of the Chinese life is the keeping of the woman in purdah. Up to the present time no effort has been made to abolish this custom. The two lives come together somewhat in the case of the missionary. The men, of course, have no restrictions in this respect, and the women occasionally have English and American friends visit them.	1908	1916.8198
It is no fault of the pathologist that this is so. He has done his best, given the means, and the time, and the opportunity, and the support of other workers. But he has had to labour under the greatest disadvantages. As yet the science of plant pathology is in its infancy. It is a young and struggling branch of biology, and it has not yet reached the stage at which it can afford to devote much attention to practical problems. The best workers in the subject are already fully occupied with the fundamental researches which must be carried out before they can be certain of their ground. The study of the individual disease is a long and laborious undertaking. It is not merely a matter of ascertaining the organism which causes the symptoms, but of isolating that organism and watching its life history through every phase, both in its active and in its resting stages, and of determining the relation of each phase to the symptoms. All this takes time. To make the matter clear by a concrete example, the potato wart disease, which is one of the most serious diseases with which the potato grower has to contend, is still not fully understood, though it has been under investigation for over 20 years. And this is not because the workers have not been willing to spend the time, and to devote the attention which it requires; but simply because the organism is a very complex one, and it takes time to find out its complex history. When the pathologist has made this preliminary study, and has determined the cause of the disease, he has only just begun. He has next to find out the conditions under which the organism is able to produce the symptoms, and the means which can be used to render those conditions ineffective.	1911	1892.1924

This was the case even in Brussels, where, after the second battle of Ypres, the Germans had boasted that they had taken 260,000 British prisoners. The story was too absurd to be taken seriously, for it would have meant that the whole of the British Army had surrendered. The Germans had, however, no scruple in publishing the statement, and as the British and Belgian papers had been suppressed, the people of Brussels were obliged to accept the news on the authority of the German Army. THE PROCLAMATION IN LONDON. [Facing page 58.1 On the other hand, the German people were credulously swallowing the tale of British cowardice and the activities of a mythical British air fleet. The German Army, it was stated, was aware of the presence of British aeroplanes hovering constantly over their lines, and dropping explosive bombs. In all probability the German General Staff had been fooled by their own aeronauts, for the only British aircraft anywhere near the German lines were those of the brave little Belgian aviators, who have since performed such heroic feats. These brave men, alas! had no bombs to drop, but they reconnoitred the German lines, and sent back valuable information to their chiefs. As the German people were being fed on these silly fables, so the British and Belgian people were being told by their captors that the German people were indifferent to the war, and were being oppressed by their Government.	1906	1925.1403
"""Vase shajied lamps are also common, while others take the form of a lyre, a caduceus, and even a helmet. The wick hole is usually in the back of the lamp, and the spout, from which the flame is fed, is placed on one side. The hole is sometimes in the shape of a dolphin, and the spout of a wing or a spear, while the feet of the lamp are formed of a lion's paw or a goat's horn.

"Ward represents the view that gregariousness simply is the caiisf of those social phenomena which the sociaUsts regard as the cause and foundation of human society. In spite of the fact that he accepts the doctrine of ""the social instinct,"" Ward regards social phenomena as being subject to the laws of evolution and development, in just the same way as any physical occurrence. He dismisses from the field of serious consideration the old doctrine that social phenomena are due to the operation of a supernatural power, which acts in a capricious and arbitrary manner. The only other alternative is the belief that social phenomena are due to the operation of the social instinct or social instincts, or to the feelings which are produced by these instincts. As I have said, Ward rejects this view. He is at one with Spencer in his rejection of the social instinct. He considers that the most primitive state of human beings is that of individuals who have no feeling whatever for one another except that of antago nism. The first and only bond which can unite such individuals is that of force. One individual masters another, and so 194 becomes his master, and the relation of master and slave is established. This relation is the basis of the patriarchal family, of kinship, and of citizenship. In this way Ward arrives at a view of the origin and basis of human society which, on the whole, is similar to that adopted by the utilitarian school of ethics."	1908	1943.6617
These plates of baleen are formed of the same hard, elastic substance that composes the hair of land animals, and are used by the whales to filter the water of the sea. The mouth of a whale of this kind is gigantic. When opened, it reveals a cavern forty feet in length, covered with transverse folds of skin, and from the upper jaw hang down, to within a foot or so of the tongue, about three hundred of the baleen plates on each side. This fringe of whale plate becomes the instrument by which the whale strains its food from the water. The animal is about to engulf ! 1 1 its prey. The great mouth opens wide, and the water rushes in with its burden of small fish, crustaceans, molluscs, etc. The whale then closes its mouth and raises its head above the surface. The tongue is now forced upward and the water is expelled. As the water leaves the mouth, the frayed edges of the baleen plates of whalebone serve as a sieve to prevent the escape of the food. The whale then lowers its head, and passes through the water with its mouth wide open, thus taking advantage of the resistance of the water to force the particles of food against the inner side of the baleen.	1909	1884.567
"The first meeting of this Commission was held at the International Electrical Exhibition in Turin on November 11th, 1911. It was decided to call the Commission the "" International Commission on Illumination, "" and the following were appointed as its officers : — President : M. P. de Mongeot, Paris, France (President of the French Committee). Vice-Presidents : M. A. J. Fresnel, Hannover, Germany (President of the German Committee). M. C. de Shizt, Bruxelles, Belgium (President of the Belgian Committee). M. R. R. Bruck, Stockholm, Sweden (President of the Swedish Committee). Mr. R. G. D. Allen, London, England (President of the Illuminating Engineering Society). M. A. W. Marckwald, A. C, Berlin, Germany, was appointed Secretary General. The Commission then entered into possession of the by-laws of the Comité International de Photométrie, and it was agreed that this Committee should be merged with the new International Commission, with the modifications to be found in the by-laws adopted by the new Commission, which are as follows : — BY-LAWS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON ILLUMINATION. Article 1. — There is constituted an International Commission on Illumination, having for its object to study all systems of lighting and technical problems in connexion therewith, and in order to facilitate the exchange of ideas and advise the best methods to be followed, in so far as the same can be done with advantage. Art. 2. — The Commission consists of delegates from the different countries, which are represented in the International Electrical Congress."	1912	1920.2208
— This value is obtained by saponifying a known weight of the oil with a measured excess of alcoholic potash, and determining the excess of alkali with hydrochloric acid. The total alkali required for saponification is known as the saponiJicatioH value, and the excess of alkali gives the weight of KOH equivalent to the weight of fatty acids present in the oil. From this the weight of oil taken is calculated to require for saponification the same weight of KOH as one gramme of stearin, or 2-81 cc. of N hydrochloric acid. This is known as the stearin equivalent, or the theoretical value, and is compared with the actual value, or the Hehner value, which is calculated to require for saponification the same weight of KOH as one gramme of oleic acid, or 4-5 cc. of N hydrochloric acid.	1913	1923.011
The eccentricity e of the load is e = OC - CB = 3 - 2-125 = 0-875 inch. The moment of the load about D is M = e X W = 0-875 x 0-04 = 0-035 tonne inches. Now, if we consider the left hand side of the section, we have: Let R = reaction at left hand end of hook. Then, taking moments about D: 0-035 = R x 1-5 Hence, R = -0233 tonne = 0-0233 x 1000 = 23-3 kilos. And, W = load = 0-04 tonne = 40 kilos. Hence, the maximum tension T = W + R = 0-04 + 0-0233 = 0-0633 tonne = 63-3 kilos. The area of the section is: A = 1-5 x 2| = 3-75 square inches. Therefore, the mean intensity of stress over the section is: 63-3 63-3 x 100 = 16-88 kilos per square inch. 3-75 The moment of inertia of the section about the line DE is found by taking the moments of inertia of the two rectangles about DE. The distance CB is 2-125 inches. B.C. X (3-375) = (i X (2i) 2 x 2-125) + (1 x 1-5 x (2-125) 2 ) B.C.	1908	1983.0167
"I was particularly struck with the very high reflecting power of the Rhodaminc ribbon for red rays, and I am glad to hear that Mr. Ritchie has been able to confirm my results. I would like to make one or two remarks upon the subject of the colour of electric light, as I have had some experience in this matter. In the first place, let me say that I do not think the colour of the light emitted by ordinary carbon filament lamps is in any way objectionable. On the contrary, I have been much struck with the beauty of the effect produced by such lamps, when used for decorative purposes, in the Exhibition buildings at Ghent. It is, however, a well known fact that the light emitted by the carbon filament lamp is deficient in red rays, and I think Mr. Ritchie is right in saying that this defect is accentuated by the use of reflectors. I have always been of opinion that the effect of the reflector is simply to concentrate the spectrum of the lamp, and that the red rays, being the least refrangible, are thrown off in the most direct manner. I am glad to learn from Mr. Ritchie that this is the case. I have also always maintained that the effect produced by the combination of a poor lamp and a good reflector is very much worse than that produced by a good lamp and a poor reflector. I have been much struck with the effect produced by the use of the ""white"" or ""daylight"" lamps, and still more by the ""tungsten"" lamps."	1912	1879.0731
His right arm was bandaged to his side, and his left hand was in a sling. He was a quiet man of about fifty. He had a grey beard and wore spectacles. The mere touch of the English soil had made him an Englishman. He treated the waiters, the porters, the little dirty children with the contemptuous tolerance of the Englishman for the foreigner. He was the real thing, and he felt it. The only little thing which he had noticed with a feeling of annoyance was that the woman who sat opposite him at the little round table, and who drank white vermouth with a squeezed lemon, was also an Englishwoman. She was reading an English novel. She wore a straw hat trimmed with a blue bow. Her hair was tied in a loose knot at the back of her neck. She had a very nice neck and pretty shoulders. She had also a pretty hand and well shaped feet. He had watched her put them into a pair of yellow kid shoes with gilt buckles. He had observed with some curiosity her Englishness, for by all the signs and tokens she was a young woman of the upper middle class. She had not been to the university, probably, but she had been to a good school. She was not a lady by birth, but she was well educated.	1913	1912.2737
"You are very young, Paul. You have not learned to know the invisible, to feel the warmth of the invisible. But you shall learn it all."" ""What is the invisible?"" he asked. ""The invisible is love, is hope, is God — it is all that we cannot see with our eyes but know with our hearts. Close your eyes, Paul."" He closed them. ""Now, Paul, can you see me?"" ""No, my lady."" ""But you know I am here."" ""Yes."" ""Why do you know?"" ""I feel you — your nearness."" ""Very good. That is the first lesson. And now, Paul, I want you to feel for something that is not here."" ""What is it, my lady?"" ""It is love, Paul. Feel for it — stretch out your hands — feel for love!"" The child stretched out his hands, and in that moment a piece of paving stone, half concealed by the straw, slipped from under his feet. He was falling, falling, and the ground leapt up to meet him! He felt a sudden grasp, and the lady's hands were about his waist. He opened his eyes, and she was looking into his face. She had caught him in his fall. ""You see!"" she said. ""You see! You have saved me, my lady! You have caught me!"" ""You see!"" she said again."	1909	1917.48
"When a prisoner is placed on trial for an alleged crime he commits, the evidence upon which it is sought to convict him is submitted to a jury of his peers. Should that jury be evenly divided in opinion, the prisoner is acquitted, as he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. If convicted, he is entitled to the benefit of appeal. Such is the procedure in a criminal case, the object of which is to safeguard by every means in the power of the law the individual citizen against the tyrany of the State. But when a litigant is seeking to obtain a decree nisi in the Divorce Court no jury is called upon to consider the evidence. The case is submitted to a judge sitting alone, who himself decides whether the evidence is sufficient to justify him in making the decree asked for. Should decrees be granted in cases where the evidence is insufficient, the question at once arises in the mind of the critic: ""Who is to blame in such instances: the litigant who has misled the judge, or the judge who has been misled?"""	1911	1896.2213
The equation of the forced oscillation is ^ + ^ + ^ = i (14) where A is the moment of the external couple. This equation is similar to the one for a simple harmonic disturbance of a simple pendulum. The solution is of the form 9 = 0 + c sin (wt + 6) (15) where 0 is the phase angle and 0 the amplitude of the oscillation. The quantity 0 is the angle between the line of action of the moment A and the radius vector drawn from the centre of oscillation to the point where the moment A may be considered as applied. The quantity 0 is the angle between the line of action of the moment A and the radius vector drawn from the centre of oscillation to the centre of inertia.	1912	1963.5112
In any case it is the time. Mix up the developer to be used for all the prints and use that, but it is better to learn the right time with a fresh developer. The reason for this is that a developer cannot be used over and over again for the same time. It loses strength with use and so a print developing for thirty seconds in a fresh developer may require a minute or more in a developer that has been used several times. When the right time has been found out the developer may be used again and again. Perhaps the best developer for beginners to use is the one recommended by the paper makers. It is sure to be right. It is better to keep the developer for the whites in one place and the developer for the blacks in another. In this way the whites cannot be accidentally stained by the blacks. For this reason, if for no other, one must have two trays. The blacks are developed first and the whites after, and so the blacks are always first and the whites second. In half tone or large picture work the blacks should be developed and fixed and the whites only developed, the fixing being left till after mounting. This is because the fixing stops development and so if the whites were fixed as well as the blacks the whites could not be developed further and would be dull and flat.	1912	1969.772
"T. H. F. The Electrical World, in an editorial on the subject of street lighting, has the following: "" It is not an uncommon thing to hear the statement that the average public is indifferent to the kind of lighting in public streets. If that were true, it would be sufficient to say that it is not a good basis for engineering practice. But it is not true. The average public is not indifferent to the kind of lighting in public streets, but rather it is unable to express its opinion on the subject in any definite manner. It is not able to compare one kind of lighting with another. It is perfectly willing to offer a general opinion that the lighting in its own community is poor, but it is unable to say that it is poorer than that in other communities, or that it is of a different kind than that in other communities, or that it is of a different kind than that in other communities, or that it is of a different kind than that in other communities."	1912	1917.2477
In a great many cases, where the farm is not too far from the railway station, a boy is sent to school at about the age of six and a half, and in any case a girl is sent at six, for there is much more difficulty in teaching a girl at home than a boy. If the farm is too remote to allow of daily school life, the children are boarded out. At the schools in the towns and villages the ordinary curriculum of reading, writing, and arithmetic is supplemented by needlework for the girls, and by gardening and carpentry for the boys. The chief difficulty lies in the fact that the school is almost invariably a church school, and the farmer's children frequently belong to a different denomination from that of the schoolmaster. This is a matter of great importance to the parents, for the schoolmaster is generally a busy man, with many other calls on his time, and the school is very largely kept open by the interest which he takes in it.	1908	1896.5953
"The first of the four great mathematicians who were born in the nineteenth century and who are represented in this collection is Georg Cantor. Cantor was born in St. Petersburg on March 3, 1845, and died in Halle on January 6, 1918. He was educated at the University of Berlin, where he studied under Kummer, Eisenstein, Weierstrass, and Kronecker. After having served as a private tutor for several years he was called to a position as teacher in the gymnasium at Frankfurt-on-the-Main. In 1872 he was appointed extraordinary professor at the University of Giesen, and in 1879 he was transferred to a like position at the University of Halle. Cantor was the founder of the theory of transfinite numbers. The first of his articles reprinted in this collection, that on the ""Fifth Solitary Point of the Second Course of the Weierstrass Function, "" is a criticism of a paper by the well-known German mathematician, Karl Weierstrass. The second article, ""On the Transfinite Numbers, "" is the first of a long series of articles in which Cantor develops his theory of transfinite numbers. In the course of his investigations Cantor was led to the formulation of the well-known Cantorian principle of the invariance of the power of a set under a one-to-one transformation. In the case of finite sets this principle is easily verified, but in the case of infinite sets the situation is much more complicated."	1911	1939.268
"10), and the latter was found to have the less resistance. 12. The floats are attached to the framework of the machine by means of blocks, known as ""tripods, "" each float being supported on three such blocks, one towards each end, and one in the middle. The middle block is cut away in a curious way, which will be described later. 13. All the models, except No. 33, which will be described presently, are built up of spruce and balsa wood, and are covered with a thin sheet of spruce plywood. The floats are hollow, and the plywood covering is made use of to give them their shape. The frame is built up inside this covering, and is not made use of in the least to determine the external shape. The reason for this is that it is always impossible to make a wooden model absolutely watertight, and if the wood is made use of to determine the external shape, it is in some places very thin, and is therefore liable to be damaged, and so altered in shape. In the case of the aluminium floats, the plywood covering is dispensed with, and the frame is made use of to give the floats their shape. The floats are now built up of a number of thin sheets of duralumin, known as ""spacers, "" which are put together in such a way that the frames of the floats are embedded in them."	1912	1877.7522
This is the problem of the relation of the relative fecundity of the various social classes to the inheritance of socially useful or harmful traits. 1 The answer to this question is being sought with great zeal at the present time. It is a problem of the first importance and one that must be solved before effective measures can be taken for the betterment of society. The answer is being sought from the data of pedigree study by a number of biologists, among them Miss C. B. Davenport, Dr. J. B. S. Haldane, and Dr. R. A. Fisher, in England, and Professor A. H. Estabrook and Professor K. L. Billings in this country. The answer is also being sought from the facts of the census of various states by a number of sociologists, among them Professor E. A. Ross and Professor A. J. Todd in this country, and Professor A. de Foville in France. All these workers are united in the belief that the answer lies in a knowledge of the laws of heredity. A few words concerning the position of the biologist in this discussion may be of interest. It is the position of the specialist whose duty it is to consider one aspect of a question and to leave the consideration of the other aspects to his fellow specialists. The biologist attempts to answer the questions: (1) Do socially useful or harmful traits show a tendency to segregate in the sense that their segregation is greater than that to be expected by chance?	1911	1883.9044

lain on the Caledonia, who had been so nearly swept from the deck of the Lawrence by the gun of the Detroit, fired the first shot from the American fleet that day at the nearest enemy — the Lady Prevost. The gun was manned by Isaac Webb and the boys from the Lawrence, for the Caledonia had no crew. It was a magnificent shot, crashing through the bulwarks and taking a heavy toll of the British. The other vessels soon joined in the cannonade, but the Lawrence held her fire. Perry knew that it was useless to waste a shot, and he wanted every gun to tell. Soon the smoke hid the enemy's line from view, and the ships drifted nearer and nearer to each other. As they neared the enemy's line Perry had the guns of the Lawrence trained for a broadside across the ships, and when within one hundred yards of the Queen Charlotte he ordered the helm put down and the ship to be brought close to the wind. The Lawrence thus came to close quarters with the Detroit and the Queen Charlotte, exposing her broadside to the entire British fleet. The Niagara followed in the wake of the Lawrence, while the other vessels continued their respective courses. 258 The wind was so light and baffling that the British were almost stationary, with the heads of their vessels pointing toward the Lawrence. The Niagara, under Captain McBlair, was manned by officers and men from Perry's old ship, the President, and by other picked men.	1913	1894.6893
My own opinion is that, provided the signal is placed on the same level as the running line, interference is more likely to arise from the position of the signal than from the height of the lamp. Mr. Eck also mentions the fact that, where the signals are illuminated by incandescent lamps, the light is insufficient. This is a point which I would emphasise, as it has been my own experience, and I must say that the ordinary incandescent lamp is quite inadequate for signalling purposes. I have not yet had an opportunity of trying the tungsten lamps for this purpose, but I feel sure that their use would give satisfactory results. In concluding my remarks, I would again express my appreciation of the value of the communications which have been received, and would ask for a continuance of the interest which has already been taken in the subject.	1912	1896.8102
The trees were bare, the air sharp, but always the sky blue and the sun warm. He would walk and walk till he was tired out, and then lie down on the dry bracken, and let the sun and the stillness of the woods calm his fevered soul. Yet still he did not dare to speak to his mother of his hope. She was so happy again, and he would not let her know how he was tormented by his doubt. It was on the afternoon of one of these lonely pilgrimages that he finally made up his mind to go to the cottage and learn the truth. As he lay on the hillside, the doubt of his powers and the pain of his loneliness came to a head.	1909	1914.899

"In Canada, after much discussion, it has been decided to try the system of minimimi wage rates for women in employments extending over two or more provinces. Among the English Acts best worth knowing by all who are interested in the question of the socialisation of the people, are the Shops Act of 1912, and the Factory Act of 1911, with their amending Acts of 1912.

He has no interest in the law as a cause of certain effects, but only in its meaning as a will. And wherever we have to deal with the interpretation of will, we have to deal with the purposive knowledge. It is a knowledge which is very large in its extension. It includes all the knowledge of the jurist, of the historian, of the philologist, of the critic, and of the psychologist. The whole field of the interpretation of will is the field of purposive knowledge. And this purposive knowledge is, indeed, a very different kind of knowledge from the causal knowledge of the scientist. It is a knowledge which is more difficult to acquire, and it is a knowledge which is more easily lost again. For instance, we may have a very large knowledge of the laws of our own country, but if we emigrate to a new country, we lose that knowledge, for it is no longer a purposive knowledge. We have to begin all over again to acquire the purposive knowledge of the laws of the new country. On the other hand, the scientist's causal knowledge is not easily lost. He may forget a great deal of it, but he has only to go back to his books and he can easily recover it. He has not to begin all over again. He has a great advantage over the purposed knowledge. But the purposive knowledge is, indeed, the knowledge which is most important for our real life. The scientist may have a very large causal knowledge, but if he is a bad judge, or a bad lawyer, or a bad historian, or a bad critic, he cannot be a good citizen.	1909	1905.1393
So smooth their way, it seems as if the stream, Bore only shadows, imaged in a dream, Of moving craft; so gently on they go, So slow, the current scarcely seems to flow. 1 THE ILIAD AND THE ODYSSEY 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 WE have now come to the last of the great poets whose works are the foundation of the study of literature, — the last in the ordinary sequence of chronological study, though not, of course, in time, for the Iliad and the Odyssey are far older than the Aeneid. But they are included in the course of the study because they are the last great work in the field of narrative poetry, and because they provide a most instructive contrast with the work of Virgil. If we were to examine them solely as narrative poems, we would put them first. But as narrative poems they are really one, and as such they begin the work of art that has no end. They are the fountain source of all narrative art. It is true that the narrative impulse is older than song. It is older than literature itself. There is in the mind of all men, savage and civilised alike, an impulse to tell a story.	1913	1885.0612
2d, may serve as an explanation of its superior ductility. The effect of magnesium is therefore very beneficial. In order to prove this, a number of alloys were prepared containing from 0 5 to 3 percent, of magnesium, and this was the only variable ; the alloys contained 25 percent, of zinc, and were prepared either by melting the copper and adding zinc in the form of brass, or by mixing the melted copper with the required amount of zinc dust. The alloys were prepared and tested in the same way as the alloys Nos. 22 to 27, Tables 4 and 5. The results are shown in Table 6. It will be seen that while the alloys containing less than I percent, of magnesium do not attain a higher tensile strength than alloy No. 2d, containing 25 percent, zinc without magnesium, the introduction of 1-2 percent. magnesium increases the tensile strength to 28-29 tonnes per square inch, combined with 20-21 percent, elongation. This is the most favourable result obtainable with 25 percent, zinc. The further addition of magnesium does not give any further increase in tensile strength ; on the other hand, the ductility is considerably impaired. In this connection, it is interesting to compare the alloy 2o/2, Table 6, containing 2 percent, of magnesium, with the alloy 2d, Table 4, containing 25 percent, of zinc and no magnesium.	1912	1887.6798
But there was no one on the bridge that day who did not do his duty to the uttermost. It was the first time that Captain Colin Campbell had commanded a ship in action, and he had no experience of modern naval warfare. Yet he displayed all the qualities of a great commander. In the very centre of the bridge, his head above the rest, he remained, watching the enemy's movements through the haze, coolly directing the fire of his ship and the manoeuvres of the squadron. He was like a great conductor, and the ship was his orchestra, obeying his slightest gesture. He was a man of middle height, sparely built, with a clean shaven face that showed only the slightest trace of a blue-black beard. His eyes, blue and steady, were set rather far apart, and under the brows, which were thickly thatched with hair, they had a peculiar look of being always half closed, as if the owner had to make a special effort to see or to hear.	1906	1920.509
"What a difference in the effect produced, for example, by the following two methods of presenting the points of a case: ""The authorities cited by the plaintiff do not support his contention. They are not in point. The defendant submits that the law is as stated by his counsel. "" Or, ""The plaintiff's counsel cite a number of cases which he claims support his contention. A careful reading of these authorities will show that they do not in any way uphold the theory of the plaintiff. The law, as stated by the defendant's counsel, is supported by the weight of authority. "" The former method is far superior to the latter for the purpose in view. The second is an attempt to belittle the opposite side by a direct attack, and it savours of the idea that the side must be forced into the mind of the court. It is better, if necessary to comment on the authorities cited by the opposite side, to do so in a way that shows them to be understood and to have been weighed by the advocate, and to have been found wanting. The following is an example of a careful and effective method of meeting a proposition advanced by the opposite counsel : ""The defendant's counsel, in support of his contention, cite the case of Smith v. Jones, 1 Allen 1."	1913	1931.9325
"But the law is not made by such men. The law is made by those who have learned to look beyond the present moment and to see that happiness is the only thing worth having. ""Happiness, as the object of law, is not the happiness of the individual, but the greatest happiness of the greatest number. The law is utilitarian in its theory and practice. It aims to give the greatest good to the greatest number. It aims to reduce the misery of the few to the lowest possible point consistent with the happiness of the many. It does not ignore the individual, the minority, the weak, the poor, the oppressed, the unfortunate. It does not attempt to make them happy at the expense of the majority. It endeavours to protect them and to give them a fair chance in the struggle for life. ""The law is equality. It gives to every man the right to be himself, to do his best, to enjoy the fruits of his labour without interference from his fellows. It does not guarantee success, but it guarantees opportunity. It does not guarantee happiness, but it guarantees the right to strive for happiness. It does not guarantee a fair chance to the rich man at the expense of the poor man, or to the poor man at the expense of the rich man, but it guarantees a fair chance to both.

And if it is intended to give the air of a serious study of literature, it fails altogether; for the inexactness is so glaring, that the reader feels that the translation is a makeshift, and is immediately thrown back on his own knowledge of the language. No one who remembers the difficulty of framing a translation on the spur of the moment, will have the cruelty to expect it of a schoolboy. The difficulty — indeed, the impossibility — of putting oneself in the position of another mind, constitutes the chief interest of literary work — of criticism, of translation, of teaching; and a teacher who has failed to catch this interest, has failed to catch the chief lesson which it is in his power to give. It is a commonplace that translation is a translation of the word and not of the thought. That the phrase itself is misconceived, appears from the fact that many eminent writers have declared for it as a literary exercise — as a means of entering into, of reviving, the mental processes of the original. Lingua Latina is a series of lessons, and had no intention of being a book of translations. In each lesson a certain number of new words appears with illustrations of its use; the exercises are based on the use of these words. Translation, to the author, was an illustration of the power of working with a live vocabulary, and of the futility of working with a dead one.	1911	1874.1488
"But the calm of his soul was unbroken. The soft, white hand that had been so soon kissed, so soon cruelly kissed, was still outstretched and he took it gently. ""Alma, "" he said, ""what was his name?"" ""I don't know, ’Lonzo, "" said Alma. ""He come on the train an' got off at Joliet — that's all I do know."" ""Well, "" said Alonzo, ""he ain't got no right to kiss you, an' he done it while you was engaged to me. Now you know all."" Alma was gazing at him with round, astonished eyes. ""I thought you was going to be mad, 'Lonzo, "" she stammered. ""I am mad, "" said Alonzo. ""An' I don't want to hear any more about what that man done. If he was here I wouldn't kill him, 'cause he ain't worth killin'. I'd just tell him he was a cowardly hound an' let it go at that. Are you ready to go home?"" ""I'm ready, ’Lonzo."" They walked on in silence. ""Ain'T we gonna get the things?"" said Alma. ""No, "" said Alonzo. ""An' how about the bureau?"" ""An' the bureau, "" said Alonzo. ""An' how about the chicken?"" ""An' the chicken, "" said Alonzo."	1913	1933.6447

Mammae open on to the surface of the skin, and the mother suckles the young by pressing them against her body. The adult has a leathery bill like that of a Duck, and webbed feet. The tail resembles that of a beaver, and is used as a rude paddle. The female Platypus is said to possess a poisonous spur on the hind leg, though the poison sac has been shown to be rudimentary in the male. The Echidna also has a leathery bill, and it uses its long tongue to devour ants and insects. But the female Echidna has the curious peculiarity of pouching the egg in the same way as a Kangaroo. The egg is oval in shape, being about one inch long and \ inch in diameter. It is lightly shelled, and the young Echidna remains in the pouch for about fifty days. The Anamnia, or animals without limbs, are represented by the Amphibia of Bruch. All of these except the Solenodons are insectivorous, and all have a long protruding tongue which they use to capture insects. The Centetidae live a burrowing life like that of Moles, and the Orycteropus has a strong mole-like structure and a head which recalls that of the Ant-eater. The Soledonos are insectivorous animals with a long, slender body, long limbs, and a long pointed head.	1909	1916.3717
The price is 20 dollars. For the amateur who does not wish to pay this price, or for any price, for a separate instrument, it is furnished at a slight extra cost as an attachment to the View Metre, and of course there is no extra charge for its use with any of the other Huesgen metres. The Sensitometer The purpose of this metre is to discover the speed of a given make of plate or film, and it will also determine the best length of exposure for any given light for that plate or film. It is especially useful for the advanced amateur who develops his own plates. The DR. DREYER SENSITIVE METRE. The Dr. Dreyer Sensitive Metre is a very simple and inexpensive instrument. It consists of a small box containing a piece of sensitised paper, which can easily be replaced when necessary. Pressing a spring exposes this paper to an even diffused light of about fourteen candle power; the paper is then inserted in the camera in the same way as a plate, and the exposure is registered by the time the sensitised surface has been exposed to the light in the box. The time required to register for an exposure on this metre is three times that which would be required for a plate or film of the same speed with the light ordinarily employed. As the light used is about 14 times more intense than the average daylight, the exposure as given by the metre must be multiplied by 4. 81 in order to obtain the length of exposure for daylight to be given the plate for best results.	1912	1901.6371

The work of re-education to simple trades, the work of the workshop for the crippled, the aged, and the overworked, should be a function of the state. The state should see that these men have the means of learning a new trade. It should see that they have the means of a fresh start in life. It should see that they are not left to charity. The crippled, the aged, the overworked should not be compelled to look to charity for support. They should be a charge on the community. The community should see that they are made useful. Men's working powers should be conserved, and this conservation calls for the most careful organisation. The work of the workshop should be organised and supervised. It should be related to the work of the school, and to the work of industry. The workshop should have a well defined function. It should not be a mere refuge. It should not be a dumping ground for the useless. It should have a definite part in the organisation of the community. It should be the link between the community and industry. Its function should be to teach men and women the simple trades. It should be a means of re-education for the crippled, the aged, and the overworked. It should be a means of conserving the working power of the community. It should be a means of increasing the efficiency of the community. Its function should be to teach men and women the simple trades.	1913	1907.05
"He hesitated for a moment, then nodded his head. "" Yes, you shall. I thought you would have faith in my faith, "" he answered, lightly. "" If you go down to the basement, I believe you will find Mrs. Dempsey's home laid out for her."" Then he returned to the study to take refuge from the passion of his emotion in a battle with the ingratitude and disloyalty of his country — a battle in which he was hopelessly outnumbered. "" You ought to do the little things, "" he had said. ah! she would do them to the best of her ability, if she were only allowed the time. But the little things were precisely the things that were impossible under the present conditions; and it was simply because her husband refused to see this that they had drifted to their present unhappiness. If he had set his foot down and declared that at least the children must return to New York, she would have obeyed him, as she had obeyed him in everything, large and small, ever since that first day when he had led her into the garden, saying simply, "" I want you for my wife."" And then, amidst the tumult of her indignation against him flared up this one passionate thought: — "" What did Charles Marr think of me when he married me?"" She dismissed the thought from her mind with a shudder; and then, in spite of her agitation, and the insistent entreaty that ran through her husband's letter, she found herself wondering how he would look as he sat there, writing the words he was writing, and whether he scowled as he wrote them, or whether he smiled."	1913	1914.015
As the primary teacher is sometimes tempted to give too little knowledge, so the secondary teacher is sometimes tempted to give too much. The child is not trained to the ability to sift and select. He is trained to the ability to take what is given him. He is thus prepared to be a sponge, and not a man. The secondary school should supplement the primary school in those essentials in which it has failed, and in which the pupil is most conscious of its failure. It should do this, not by repeating the work of the primary school, but by taking the pupil where the primary school has left him, and leading him a step farther in the same direction. This it can do if it knows the aims of the primary school and the nature of the pupil as determined by the work of the primary school. The secondary school is a transition school. It is the bridge between the primary school and the school of the special end. It is the link which binds together the school of general education and the school of professional education. It has a double function. It must continue the work of the primary school, and it must begin the work of the special school. It must continue the work of the primary school in so far that it must go back of the text book, and give the training in the power to select and sift. But it must begin the work of the special school in so far that it must prepare the pupil to enter a school where this power is to be used, and where it will be more important than the power to receive and take.	1909	1891.6791
It is certain that the cells of the body are intimately related to the plasma in which they are bathed, and that this relation is mutual. It is certain that the cells are not simply set free from the body by mechanical processes, but that they are set free by the action of substances that are secreted by other cells, in the same way that the secretions of the cells of the glands of internal secretion are carried into the blood stream by the lymphatic vessels. The latter substances, however, are poured into the blood in such quantities that they reach every cell in the body. The substances that are poured into the lymphatics to induce the breaking down of tissues are in the first place secreted by the connective tissue cells, and then, when a certain quantity has been manufactured, are carried away by the lymphatic vessels; but the lymphatics do not secrete them in such quantities that they reach every part of the body.	1913	1922.3568
Range XV, lot 13. — This lot has been worked sporadically for many years, but a large amount of scrap mica can be seen. The dike is four or five feet wide and the mica is intergrown with pyroxene and feldspar. A good deal of tourmaline is found in the dike. Range XV, lot 11. — The dike is similar to that on lot 12, but is considerably narrower and the mica is found in a matrix of calcite. The property has not been worked much in the past, but there are large sheets of window glass mica lying on the dumps. The property has a good deal of promise. Range XV, lot 3. — A large body of mica is found on this lot in the dike of pyroxene or hornblende. The deposit has been worked for many years, but not in a scientific way. Crystals of mica occur in a matrix of calcite with a good deal of apatite. A large dump of window glass mica is lying on the side of the mountain. This property is one of the best in the county. Range XIV, lot 3. — Four or five feet of dike rocks show on the side of the mountain. The rock is hornblende and a little mica can be found. There appears to be some apophyllite in the dike. The property has never been worked.	1905	1939.3634
The unsanitary methods of disposing of human excreta in Porto Principe were again called to attention. In 1900 was published the first report on the relation of the house fly to the transmission of typhoid fever by the late Dr. A. J. McGlvnn. He stated that flies were able to carry the typhoid bacilli, both externally and internally. In 1901 Dr. Theobald Smith published his classical paper, proving by direct experiment that flies could carry the living typhoid bacilli from excreta to food, and that the bacilli were capable of growth and multiplication in the fly's intestines. He also showed that the house fly could carry the germs of hog cholera and of diphtheria. In 1902 Dr. Smith published his report on the relation of the house fly to the transmission of anthrax, and in 1903 he re ported its relation to the transmission of the germs of tuberculosis. In 1903 Dr. W. W. King published the first report of such experiments in this country, and his results confirmed those of Dr. Smith. Since that time many papers have been published on the subject, but the majority of them have been of a more or less general character, summarising the conclusions of the previous workers, or dealing with points of minor importance.	1911	1926.9034
The aim of this department is to supplement the work of the textbook, to give hints and suggestions that will help the beginner over the little difficulties that are always arising in the dark room, that will help him to avoid the pitfalls that are so numerous and so easily fallen into, and to point out the best methods of doing the various things that have to be done. And to do this we need the cooperation of our readers, both old and new. The questions that arise in the mind of the beginner are not the same as those that trouble the old hand. The beginner is not sure as to the best kind of camera to buy, the best kind of lens, the best kind of plate, the best kind of developing solution, etc.	1912	1925.9703
""" I know it does, poor dear man. And he is so anxious. And I am so afraid about Edward's health. He seems to labour under some sudden nervous depression, which I can't understand."" "" Yes, I noticed that. But I believe it is simply owing to his precarious position, and his fears lest he should have to take the humiliating step of — selling out. He does not want to leave the Service, and yet, I fear, his prospects are very dark."" 380 Lady William's dismayed face expressed her most generous comprehension of the difficulty and anxiety of her brother-in-law, the Colonel's probable state of mind; her eyes wandered about her drawing-room — she was conscious of her pretty, sheltered, aristocratic existence, and felt that it was very sad that that excellent, that much-loved man, should be obliged to suffer so much."	1913	1887.9858
The chief thoroughfares had been barricaded at Finchley, Holloway, Hackney, and Barking, and minor roads at many other places. On the whole, despite the wild panic, the work had been done with a fair degree of method. The barricades were formed of railway trucks, heavy waggons, and even motor lorries, filled with stones and earth, and reinforced with iron railings, wooden sheds, and every kind of available material. The police and military had not been able to prevent the work, for the whole population seemed to have gone mad, and the sight of the barricades was enough to terrify any straggling German, who would certainly have been shot down by the mob before he had time to fire. The Germans, however, were aware of the existence of these obstacles, and were preparing to clear them.	1906	1898.9607
"The great Cathedral, with its Norman crypt and Early English nave, and the ancient Bishop's Palace, with its Norman hall, were more interesting to them than the streets and shops. The hall was the scene of the trial of William Penn for preaching Quakerism to the people of London. The trial lasted about two years, and Penn was finally acquitted, whereupon the Quakers named the new colony which they had founded in America after him, calling it Pennsylvania. It was at the trial of Penn that the jury was imprisoned for refusing to find a verdict against him, and that the famous scene took place between the Lord Chief Justice and the foreman of the jury. The judge said, ""You must find a verdict according to the evidence."" ""We cannot do otherwise, my lord, "" replied the foreman. ""The evidence does not prove the prisoner guilty."" ""Gentlemen, "" said the judge, ""you must find a verdict according to the evidence."" ""We cannot do otherwise, my lord, "" again answered the foreman. ""We have given the prisoner the benefit of the evidence, but we cannot find him guilty."" The judge ordered them to retire, saying, ""You must find a verdict according to your oaths."" To which the foreman replied, ""We will do so, my lord, as far as the evidence will allow us."""	1913	1891.0076
In the case of printing works it is not very important, because the walls are usually very dull, and do not therefore reflect much light. The average brightness of the walls in the works visited was 0-25, and the average illumination in foot candles was 7-4. Brightness of Floors. The average brightness of the floors in the printing works visited was 0-26, and the average illumination was 7-4 foot candles. The value of this figure is probably small, as the floors in printing works are usually of wood or linoleum, and in either case the reflectance is small. Brightness of Machines. The average brightness of the machines in the works visited was 0-23, and the average illumination was 7-4 foot candles. The brightness of the machines is important in printing works, as there is usually a good deal of visual work to be done on the machines themselves, or on the materials in course of manufacture. The average figure of 0-23 is, however, not very high, and indicates that the machines are not very highly illuminated. It is possible, however, that the machines are not so bright in the day time, when no artificial light is available. Brightness of Type. The average brightness of the type in the printing works visited was 0-24, and the average illumination was 7-4 foot candles. The type is no doubt very much more brightly illuminated than this average figure would seem to indicate, for it is usually placed on a white or light coloured background, and the contrast is therefore very great. The brightness of the type is of considerable importance in printing works, as it is on type that most of the visual effort is expended.	1912	1886.4525

The same experience will be felt and interpreted in an entirely different way by different persons. The same surroundings will shape the life of one person in one way and that of another in an entirely different way. This is the reason why the most careful and conscientious parental training does not always produce the expected results, and why the worst surroundings do not always result in the worst characters. There is no doubt that the educational process is, in the final result, the same for all. The educated man is always a man of ideas, and the uneducated man is always the man without ideas. But the way in which the ideas are acquired, the number and the kind of ideas, and the attitude toward the ideas, all depend upon the original endowment.	1909	1920.6196

The best way to avoid the problem of patchy fog is to avoid operating in or near the area if patchy fog is known or suspected. If it is necessary to operate in such conditions, the best procedure is to remain in the clear and monitor the movement of the fog patches. If this cannot be done, then a safe plan is to assume that the fog will extend and the visibility will deteriorate and make plans accordingly. 1.2.5. STRATUS STRATUS is the name given to a cloud layer that is more than 1,000 ft thick but less than 10,000 ft thick. It has no base and no top, but the thickness is determined by the presence of clouds at the base of the layer. The term stratus is used for a layer that is not precipitating. If the layer is precipitating, the term nimbostratus is used. The term stratus also has been used for a layer of fog, but this is no longer considered proper. 1.2.5.1. Types of stratus. There are three types of stratus: (1) stratus, (2) stratocumulus, and (3) nimbostratus 1.2.5.1.1. STRATUS. The base of stratus is always below 10,000 ft, but as a practical matter, the term is used only for layers of clouds that form at low levels, usually below 5,000 ft. The term stratus is used to designate a layer of clouds that does not precipitate.	1913	1985.5911

The London County Council has power to reconstruct, widen, and alter the level of the streets, and to make new streets. It has also control over the tramways, bridges, and subways. The work of the Council is largely that of carrying out the local needs of the various boroughs, and this is done by the Council acting through its committees. The most important committee is that of Works and Bridges, which controls the streets, tramways, and bridges. Its work is mainly of a mechanical character, and consists in the administration of numerous Acts of Parliament relating to the streets. It determines the width and level of the streets, their lighting, paving, and cleansing, and the mode in which the sewers are connected with the houses. It has to consider all applications for the placing of structures in the streets, as well as those for the making of new streets and alterations in existing ones.	1907	1893.4767
"— This little beetle, about one quarter of an inch long, is common on the apple and peach and is the worst enemy of the plum and cherry. The female lays crescent shaped eggs just under the skin of the fruit, and the young grub eats its way through the pit and then bores into the branch and trunk. In spring and fall the curculio is likely to be found hibernating or preparing to hybernate in the crevices of the bark and under fallen leaves. Remedies. A very careful and thorough inspection of the trees and the ground under them should be made in the fall and again in the spring, and every curculio found should be crushed. In the spring the curculio may be driven from the trees by jarring them on a sheet. Spraying the trees with arsenate of lead will kill the curculio, but will not save the fruit that has been stung and may injure fruit badly. The Green Aphis (Myzus persicae var. 19 — Peach aphis. US). — This is the common green plant louse or aphis. See head of ""Insects injurious to the apple."" It is injurious to the plum in the same way as to the apple except that it does not transmit any fungus disease."	1914	1912.5634
She is a mere adjunct to his career, irrespective of whether or not she has a career of her own. As such she is a slave, as much as is the chattel wife. Her slavery is not so obvious, but it is none the less real. The world, the public, never views her as a separate entity, but always as the complement of her husband. It is he, not she, that the world considers. But examine the life of this woman, and you will find it a life of servitude. It is a life of self sacrificing, of renunciation. She has no will of her own. She must do what he dictates, or what the public demands. She must conform to social demands, to the demands of his career. She cannot have a career of her own. If she is a writer, a painter, a musician, she must give it all up. It is he that the world sees, not she.	1911	1885.1473
Last autumn I rooted some of the newer sorts of roses in this way, and found the percentage of plants very high. I have also used this method with several sorts of vines, and this spring hope to have a good number of the California vine, that are very hard to get any other way. For this method a wooden box, about eight inches deep, is filled with one third good soil, one third leaf mould, and one third sand or fine gravel. This is to be placed in a greenhouse where it can be kept at a high temperature, about 75 ° to 80 °. When the box is filled, it is well firmed, and then the surface is made level, and is pressed down so that it is about half an inch below the top of the box.	1914	1919.138

CHAPTER XI It was past eleven when Marcia came into the drawing-room and found her brother. She sat down on the piano stool, and began to play softly. He looked at her, but made no remark. He felt too weary to be angry. She was a little afraid of him ; no more than a little. She had not seen that look in his eyes for a long time. "" And what is your young gentleman like ?

No sooner was the charter obtained than a meteor seemed to flit across the dark continent, and a road was marked out to the heart of Africa, along which advancing columns were to move at stated intervals, and where every inch of ground was to be marked with the Union Jack. The first step was the sending out of a survey party, under Mr. Selous. Although he was accompanied by a large escort, the difficulties of the undertaking were immense. He was subjected to the constant danger of being attacked; the country was in no way suited to railway construction. In the end the idea was abandoned, and it was decided to send out an expedition. This was accomplished by the end of the year. For the services of Mr. Selous, Sir Henry [43]  Moffatt, and other prominent members of the survey party, the gratitude of the Chartered Company is fully appreciated. The agitation for the abolition of slavery, which had been so long carried on in this country, had made the question of the Matabele rising a matter of absorbing interest. This was largely responsible for the haste with which the expedition was got together. The forces were under the command of Colonel (afterwards Major-General) E. P. Colley. They consisted of a column of 500 whites with 200 mounted men, 600 black police, and 300 of the Bechuanaland Border Police. The whole was divided into six divisions, each of which was to move by a different route. From Bulawayo there was a strong feeling that the expedition was premature, and Colonel Colley, who was not in favour of it, was overruled.	1908	1863.5481
This is not to say that learning and judgement are the only requisites of statesmanship; but they are the qualities which most seldom appear together in one individual. It is the business of the university to provide those who shall possess them, and for this it needs an intimate relation with public affairs. In the absence of such a relation, the university has no means of estimating the nature and magnitude of the duties it must fulfil. In the absence of such a relation, the university cannot adequately fulfil its own function of preparing men for public life. In the absence of such a relation, the university cannot adequately fulfil its own function of providing the people with the knowledge which they need. It is only through the mutual interdependence of the university and public affairs that the subject matter of learning can be determined. The great questions which agitate society change with surprising rapidity. The subjects of the current controversy which is to be settled, not only by legislation, but by public opinion, and thus by the common judgement of the people, shift from one to another with bewildering speed. Public opinion, as it is sometimes called, is in reality the judgement of the few, and this judgement is reached, not in the arena of active life, but in the calm of the study. The knowledge of a decade ago is what our fathers learned; we have our own knowledge to provide. In order to provide it, we must have some criterion by which to determine what knowledge is needed; and this criterion can only be found in the arena of public affairs.	1911	1903.0475
He thought that was a very good value for a platform, and he would be quite satisfied if when the time came the Board of Trade would allow him to have that value. He was inclined to think that the value would be a good deal higher. He had no doubt that if they provided for a certain value on the platform, the Board of Trade would allow it to be a good deal higher in the case of an electric station than in the case of a steam station. The question of the lighting of the station was so intimately bound up with the design of the station that he thought it was better for the designer to arrange the lighting himself, and to be responsible for it.	1912	1932.9845
The deaths of the Titanic crew were more in the nature of a sacrifice. That is to say, men and women made the supreme effort for others — for the children first, and then for the women. The Titanic disaster was the greatest sacrifice yet made in the service of humanity, but it was not the first. The first was made at the time of the Siege of Paris, when balloonists offered themselves as a sacrifice in order to carry despatches to the French Army. The balloon was always torn to shreds by the fire of the German guns, and the aeronauts perished. The number was small, but it was a noble sacrifice, and all the more so because there was no hope. The same thing was done during the Boxer uprising in China, when a certain number of missionaries offered themselves as a sacrifice in order to carry despatches to the world of Christian nations. They were killed, of course, but the knowledge that they were killed was a comfort to the other missionaries. They died, as the Titanic crew died, in the service of humanity. But the loss of life in the coal mines is not a sacrifice. It is simply murder, and that murder is committed by the people who buy the coal. It is not the mine owners who are to blame, for they are only the agents. If they are to be blamed at all, it is because they accept the job of agent. If there was no one to buy coal, the mine owners would not dig coal.	1911	1915.8396
That is why the Weeks Bill passed. Now what does the trust have to do with this ? The Bureau of Corporations called to the attention of the country the stock percentages of the lumber trust. The Bureau found 3,255 corporations in 43 combinations, controlling 95.16 per cent, of the lumber cut of the country. Tracers are being run voluntarily. The banking corporation of J. P. Morgan ^ Co. are the cashiers of the lumber trust. The Morgan bank — and we mention it only because of the evidence which connects it with the formation of the lumber trust — controls through its stock ownership 63.89 per cent, of the total stock of the lumber companies included in the combinations. And now they are tracing back to find out who owns the Morgan stock. That will be an interesting inquiry. We know, of course, that this lumber trust is only one of many. Each bank owned by this banking corporation has its quota in each trust. Car dealers. Coal dealers. Irrigation bond dealers. Traction bond dealers. There is no limit to the ingenuity of Wall Street. We all know that. But in this instance the lumber trust is the thing. The Bureau of Corporations estimates that this lumber trust will control 81.35 per cent, of the entire lumber cut of the country in 1915. The Bureau found, furthermore, that the lumber companies foresaw the timber famine.	1911	1929.8016
"The more general term ""predacity"" as used by Prof. Smith is more inclusive than parasitism, for it embraces a class of feeding habits which have nothing in common with parasitism, namely, the devouring of one free living form by another. In this sense predacious insects prey upon other insects, while parasitic insects prey upon other insects or animals in the sense of feeding upon the protoplasmic tissues. Thus, predacity includes both parasitism in the above sense and also what has been termed ""one free living organism feeding upon another."" It is a question whether this general term is of sufficient utility to be retained as a category in entomology. ""Predatory"" Insects as Useful Enemies. — Our consideration here will be limited to predacious insects in the more restricted sense of the term, or those which prey upon other insects; that is, those whose larvas or adults assume a more or less carnivorous habit. Insects of this class are very widely distributed, and they all have one trait in common; they kill their victims either directly by devouring them bodily or indirectly by draining them of their vital fluids. In either case, the result is the same so far as the hosts are concerned; their numbers are quickly reduced. In other words, they are all insect ""enemies."	1911	1941.6796

Instead of uniting with us in the search for means for the alleviation of every kind of suffering, they have succumbed to the seductions of demagogic speeches, and have become a prey to the passions and intrigues of the moment. They have disregarded the imperative mandates of their constituents, who desired them to devote themselves to financial legislation, the maintenance of public order, and the unbroken continuance of public life. Instead, they have turned the tribune of the legislative assembly into a rostrum for inciting hatred towards us and our servants. They have sown disorder and civil strife in the midst of the people, and have sought to incite the peasants to rebellion. The Duma has, therefore, lost the confidence of the people, which it has never possessed.	1907	1898.7745
"E. S. M. — "" The Cassowary (Belo cki) is found only in the most remote and impenetrable forests. It lives on the ground, digs up roots with its strong toes, and feeds also on fruit; its flesh is excellent. The natives kill it, sometimes alone, sometimes with the aid of the Dingo. A party of natives on foot drives it into a tree where it is trapped, or runs it down with the Dingo. The chase is very exciting, as the Henry ley huntsman found. He tells us that his Dingo, although only half grown, caught the big Cassowary."" F. L. R. — "" The Cassowary is hunted by three men, each armed with a heavy club. They hide in the brushwood, one huntsman driving the bird towards the others, who strike it on the head, and after that it is easily caught. The flesh is good eating, but the bird is never tamed."" P. V. — "" The natives of the northern coast of New Guinea use a tame Cassowary as a decoy, and so are able to take many wild ones. When a wild Cassowary is shot with a poisoned arrow, it squawks very loudly, and if one of the natives immediately runs up to it, and holds up his hand, it becomes quiet, and he can safely grasp its throat.

Thirty cities have Socialist councils, and they control the councils in eight places. In the recent elections the Socialist mayors received an average of 43.2 per cent of the total vote, as against 34.3 per cent in 1910. The Socialist council candidates received an average of 42.9 per cent of the total vote, as against 34.0 per cent in 1910. The Socialist vote in the councils was 12.3 per cent above the mayoralty vote. This is a very significant fact. It indicates that the Socialists had a larger following in the councils than in the mayoralty contest, and that the party is still gaining in strength. The Socialist candidates for mayor in 1911 received 11.6 per cent more of the total vote than did the candidates for mayor in 1910. The Socialist council candidates received 9.3 per cent more of the total vote than did the candidates for council in 1910. The Socialist vote in the councils was 2.3 per cent more than the mayoralty vote. This, too, is a significant fact, and it indicates that the party is still gaining in strength. In the ten cities which now have Socialist mayors, the party has made wonderful progress. In 1908 the Socialist candidates for mayor in these cities received an average of 29.5 per cent of the total vote.	1911	1927.282
The Lizards are almost all peculiar, and many of them are remarkable. The Dragon Lizard (Amphibolurus barbatus) is provided with a frill of skin round its neck, which it can expand to a large size. The Frilled Lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii) is still more remarkable. It can run on its hind legs like a kangaroo, and it has a large frill of skin round the neck, which it can expand to a great size. The Flying Phrynosoma (Ceratophora tentaculata) has the body flattened out, and the tail prolonged, so that it can glide from tree to tree. The Thorny Lizard (Moloch horridus) is covered with spines, and has a curious habit of drinking through the skin. The Goannas are large Monitor Lizards, the largest being the Perentie (Varanus giganteus), which is 8 feet long. The Emus, Cassowaries and Rhea are all Ratites, birds with a flat breastbone, and no keel to the breastbone, so that they cannot fly. The Emus are peculiar in having only three toes, instead of four. The Cassowaries are remarkable for their helmetlike crest on the head, and for their long, blue wattles.	1909	1908.6588
"The report concludes this ref erence with the following statement: ""If in every case mentioned in this list the remedy had been taken in the exact manner directed by the manufacturer, the number of injuries would have been reduced to a minimum and the cases of death would be practically nil."" The report does not advocate  compulsory notification of the injuries from proprietary remedies, but does urge a law ""requiring a full and accurate statement of the composition of each proprietary remedy offered for sale."" Another very significant statement is to be found in this report. Under the head of ""Drug Medicated Beverages"" the following paragraph occurs: ""At the present time a very important question is being agitated, viz., the use of certain proprietary medicines, labelled 'tonics' and 'stimulants, ' in the form of beverages."	1911	1935.1989
There is one other point on which I should like to say a few words. There is a very great danger that the propaganda of the Society for the Promotion of the Health of the Poor may be interpreted as a movement to discourage thrift, and I should like to protest against any such idea in the strongest possible terms. I am myself a strong believer in thrift, and I have always maintained that no one has a right to marry unless he can keep his wife, and that no one has a right to have children unless he can keep his wife and children. But I do not think that it is the province of a State to interfere with the private lives of its subjects, and I am quite sure that the State cannot afford to take the risk of allowing the poor to die out.	1911	1904.6802
They were not all of the same type, but the majority were of good family. When they fell, their homes were closed to them, and they were forced to enter the life. The outside world, when it was known what had happened, shut them out, and they were driven into the haunts of vice, where they were finally lost beyond hope of redemption. Will any Christian who knows these facts take upon himself the responsibility of such an act? Every one of these women had a future full of promise before them, had they been cared for and understood, and their misfortunes had been properly met. The woman who falls through ignorance and the natural love of sympathy, is a woman whose heart has been misunderstood and whose affection has been betrayed.	1911	1890.3217
Anthracnose (Colletotrichum Vitis) — (Figs. 48 and 50). This fungus produces black rotting, often ring like, of the berries, which then dry up and remain on the vine as mummified fruit. The fungus also causes a leaf spot which attacks the margins of the leaf, causing it to die back from the edge. The black spots on the leaves are the fruiting bodies of the fungus, which are readily washed off with water by the careful observer. The disease is most troublesome in the humid climate of the Mississippi basin. (This fungus produces a leaf spot quite similar to that of the Grape Phyllosticta, but the spots are black and never light coloured in the centre.) 66 A. The leaf spot, and B. the mummified berries of the grape, showing the bearing of the Anthracnose fungus (Colletotrichum Vitis). Fig. 50. Remedies.

This fungus causes a soft brown or grey rot of the berries, which soon shrivel and fall from the vine.	1914	1972.2476
(5.1 by 6.4 cm. ). The frame is made of two strips of mahogany glued together, thus making a two ply structure. The wood is then planed down to the required thickness. The two ply structure prevents warping, and the mahogany gives a good finish. The light receiving and transmitting surfaces are made of ground glass. The interior of the box is painted with dead black enamel, and the outside is finished with varnish. The box is provided with a cover, which fits tightly, thus preventing accidental exposure of the interior surfaces to light. The cover is hinged at one end and provided with a latch at the other end. The photometer is equipped with a removable mirror, which is set at 45° with respect to the transmitting and receiving surfaces.	1912	1940.1752

In the Interior West we find nearly all our deciduous trees growing naturally on this kind of soil. In the valleys, where it is not too alkaline, we find numerous orchards of apple, peach and pear. The subsoil is generally clay, but is naturally drained or tiled drained. On this soil, when care is given to tillage and irrigation, we find our finest apples and peaches. The man who wishes to be successful in growing apples, peaches, or pears in the Northwest, should take as his model the natural forests of that region, or the broad expanse of prairie where the cottonwoods, willows and hackberries grow. The open prairie soil is frequently the best possible for tree fruits, provided the subsoil is well drained. There is a general belief that a sandy soil is not a suitable one for apples. This is true, but only under certain conditions. In New York and Michigan we find on sandy soils, especially in southern exposures, some of the best early apples, but a general majority of the late varieties do poorly, or at least do not compare favourably with those grown on heavier soils. In Kansas, where we have large areas of sandy soil, the best variety after many years of trial has been Ben Davis. This variety does well almost everywhere, but excels in the sandy regions. Winesap and Jonathan, however, do poorly on this sandy soil.	1914	1878.4614

The planning of a civic centre for the city of Detroit is now being carried on by a commission appointed by the city council. A great plaza is to be formed around the new city hall, while the banks of the River Rouge are to be beautified and adorned with bridges. The plan of Washington, D. C, as a civic centre, is being developed by park and boulevard improvements. The Mall has been given over to the national government, and great public buildings are being erected there. The newly acquired site for the Congressional Library and the new gallery of art are at one end of the Mall, and at the other end is the Capitol. The new Monument to Washington is midway between the two. The old canal bed has been converted into the beautiful Concourse. The Mall is to be adorned by great buildings, which, of course, are the homes of the national government. The city of Boston is beautifying its civic centre around the old State House, while parks and boulevards are being laid out in the outskirts. The most important civic centre in the United States is that of the City of San Francisco. The City Beautiful of San Francisco is an inspired dream of architect and artist. The plan of the Civic Centre of San Francisco is not only to make the city beautiful, but to furnish a home for all public buildings, State, city, county, and Federal.	1913	1915.0115
In the special field of literature the name of Mark Twain appears, and certainly enough it is one that casts a lustre over the literary record of the republic. But to his honour be it said that he has not sought the light, or even the respect, of the tribune, and has worked, as the artist should work, isolated from the noise of the mart. We have said that in the field of sculpture no artist has received a ballot. But the great artist in the field of painting known to the voters is a colleague of Mark Twain in not seeking the light, or the respect, of the tribune: he has been a recluse and a hermit, a man of whom the public has only known that he worked with passionate devotion in his studio at the Metropohtan Museum.	1913	1894.3893
"The confession was reduced to writing, signed and sworn to by Lindsay, and the District Attorney, the police justice and the private counsel for the prosecution signed as witnesses. I have never seen a copy of that confession, but I have before me now a copy of the statement of facts, as the District Attorney called it, which was prepared by him and handed by him to the police justice for transmission to the grand jury. It is a document of great importance, for it is the only record made at that time of the alleged confession of Lindsay. It bears the signature of the police justice, and is indorsed by him ""transmitted to grand jury."" Now, in the first place, the District Attorney in his opening to the jury, admitted that this statement of facts was not signed by Lindsay. Why? Because it did not contain the substance of his confession. It was a garbled version of it. Why did the District Attorney not hand to the grand jury the confession of Lindsay? I will tell you why. Because it did not contain the substance of the confession. He knew that the grand jury would never have indicted the defendants if they had seen the confession, and he desired to procure an indictment in order that he might try his case before a jury, and by the pressure of his office compel the defendants to settle with him."	1911	1905.4521

R.A.F. 6, Section 1v, page 9. On this account the warp was only about ± 2° on the main spar, and the negative warp was therefore somewhat less than this on the main spar. The angles are obtained by rotating the trailing edge downwards when viewed from the side. The model was mounted as shown in Fig. 1, Section 1v of No. R.A.F. 6, the axis about which the pitching and yawing moments were measured being the x and z axes of the system of axes there defined. On the present model, however, the origin of the axes is taken at the quarter chords of the sections. For this reason, the pitching moments about the x and z axes are practically unaffected by the warping, as is the case for aerofoil No. R.A.F. 6 also. The origin of the axes is therefore practically unchanged by the warping. The yawing moment about the z axis is defined by the expression — pL2 (F„ cos 0 — F sin 0) (1) where F is the aerodynamic force, F, is the component of F parallel to the y axis, L is the distance of the y component of F from the line of action of F, and (p) the angle between the line of action of F and the x axis. The rolling or bank ing moment about the y axis is defined by the expression — pL2 (F sin 0 — F2 cos 0) (2) The lever arm L is measured to the quarter chord line of the model.	1912	1923.4633
The home of the overworked woman is too often a form of sweatshop. Leavenworth street in San Francisco is a street of garment factories. On the third floor of one of the buildings, a company of women sweatshoppers and their families live. All their lives they have been in thrall to the needle, and their backs have been bent beneath the burden. For them there has been no Saturday half holiday, no summer outing. Their fingers have not known the surf, nor have their eyes seen the great blue sea. On the borderland of the old and the new, they are fast losing the simplicity of the old, while they have not the advantage of the new. They are neither fish, flesh, fowl nor good red herring. In a dozen of these families, there are fifteen children, and yet even in the summer time, when school is out, they are not allowed to play. Every one plays the game of life on a narrow, crowded field. The slack time of the men's employment is our winter with its high priced coal. No child has ever seen a city park, nor the sea. The parents, too, are as deprived as the children. In the alley, in the rear of the building is a pile of garbage. The alley is a court, surrounded by buildings, and overhung by wires. In the summer, it is dusky, in the winter it is dark.	1911	1970.974
He then explained the method by which he had obtained the curve. He had taken a sensitive plate and put it behind a prism, so that the effect on the plate of the different parts of the spectrum could be measured. The result is that the photographic eye is more sensitive to the yellow and less sensitive to the blue than is the visual eye. ME. J. H. DALLAS said that he had been much impressed by the discussion, and was inclined to agree with Dr. Mees that the photographic eye was not the same as the visual eye. He believed that the sensitiveness of the photographic eye could be altered, and that it could be made more sensitive to blue light. He had been told by a manufacturer of plates that the sensitiveness of the plate could be altered at will.	1912	1929.2888
"As they entered the village, Paul looked with some trepidation at the shop on the green; he wanted to avoid Elizabeth, and yet if she came to him and held out her hand in friendship, he would embrace it. But she had left the shop, and a heavy tray was placed opposite the door, as if it were temporarily unoccupied. The old man was behind the counter. Paul went up to him, and said he wanted to know if Mrs. Elizabeth had returned from Charing. The old man said, ""Yes, she had returned; she had gone away again almost immediately, and her daughter "" — he had the rudeness to look at Paul — ""had also left the village with her."" Paul cursed him with his eyes, and, turning, left the shop. He went home, and sat down to make a last preparation for his departure; for though the state of happiness was upon him, it would be madness to allow himself to think he could live longer in this house and village. He must prepare place for the one thought that had sprung up so suddenly and beautifully in his heart, and must first send for the new servant. The scene with her was not pleasant, but it was not long; a week's wages, and a little over, soothed her into comparative peace. How could the lady of the manor be so cruel as to subject her to so much inconvenience? The new cook was to sleep in her room, she supposed, and would enjoy her society, and all that."	1909	1912.3663

It is a pity that the author of this play had not lived in the Puritan days when a more fitting punishment than the gallows would have been meted out to him. If his purpose was to hold a mirror up to society, he has failed, for society does not act as the characters in this play act. If he wished to show the depravity of the human heart, he has done that, but only in a very small part of it. If he wished to show the effects of drink, he has done that, too, but only the worst effects. If he wished to show what a man will do to gain wealth, he has done that, but only what a very small part of mankind would do.	1911	1906.8589
"I got there, sir, "" he exclaimed breathlessly, "" and got back again. I saw the whole movement of the German troops, and learned their intentions. I got the information you wanted, sir, and am ready for another job."" Then, after a little time, he related his adventures. He had ridden as far as Beccles, where he had concealed his horse in a clump of bushes, and then, disguised as a German, he had walked into the German camp, and during the course of the night had actually gained access to their orders. These he had copied out, and, under cover of the darkness, had made his way back to the place where he had concealed his horse, and had ridden home. The orders were to march on London, and to cross the river by a pontoon bridge at Yarmouth."	1906	1888.1024
CHAPTER IX LABOUR IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 1890-1912 1 This chapter will deal with the evolution of the Labour Movement in Local Government since the passing of the Local Government Act of 1888, and the year 1890, which marks the beginning of that evolution. It will describe the Labour Representation movement in the larger Municipalities, in the County Councils, in the Poor Law Boards, and in the School Boards; it will deal with the Labour Party now represented on so many of the Urban and Rural District Councils; and it will recount the experience of the Labour Movement in the Education Authorities, the Parish Councils, and the Guardians. It will describe the many and varied forms of Labour Representation in Local Government which, in the course of these twenty-two years, have appeared, flourished for a time, and disappeared again; and it will tell of the number of localities where a stable form of Labour Representation has been established, and the number where it is not yet possible to secure stable results. The author has been obliged to confine himself to a selection of examples, and he must ask his readers to remember that the history he presents to them is the history of his own experience only, and that it is not exhaustive, since it cannot include some of the most interesting episodes of Labour Representation.	1907	1926.4489
"And, finally, Professor M. Schiaparelli himself, seeing the formidable array of contrary evidence, was obliged to acknowledge, in a letter to myself in December, 1904, the ""validity of the facts adduced "" by Professor Barnard, and to admit that the canals of Mars had "" suffered a derangement in popular opinion."" In some of the foregoing remarks I have alluded to an optical illusion which is known by the name of "" irradiation."" This is a phenomenon so familiar and so generally known that I need not do more than recall it here. Wherever there is a sudden change from light to shade the line appears to bulge outwards. Thus, a narrow band of black on a white surface will seem to have a broad band of white round it, and I have even seen it stated that the conventional foxing of old prints is done in order to enhance the effect of such irradiation!"	1913	1888.9956
He had made up his mind to this, and was beginning to realise it with a dull pain, when an incident occurred which in a flash changed his whole outlook. He was sitting in a corner of the dingy coffee-room after breakfast, reading a morning paper. Suddenly he dropped the paper, and stared with wide open eyes at a man who entered hurriedly, and stood for a moment in the middle of the room looking about him. This man was tall, and wore a shabby, ancient frock coat, a black bowler hat, and a pair of yellow kid gloves, which had seen far better days. The collar of his white shirt was turned down over a grey silk scarf, and the back of his coat bulged out in an unusual manner.	1913	1901.406
"The writers have recently compared the candlepower output of tungsten lamps in two types of fixtures, one containing mercury vapour tubes as auxiliary lighting units and the other of an ordinary incandescent lamp. The fixtures in which the comparison was made are two styles of wall brackets, the one called the ""avalon"" bracket (figs. 1 and 2) being made by the Edison Lamp Works and the one called the ""talisman"" bracket (figs. 3 and 4) being made by the Westinghouse Electric Mfg. Co. Both brackets have been designed with special regard to the necessity of obtaining high candlepower output, and the reflectors employed in them are of the best quality obtainable. The lamps used in the comparison were all of the standard Edison make, the voltage being 115, and the watts used per lamp were as follows: lO watts, 15 watts, 25 watts, 40 watts, 60 watts, 75 watts, 100 watts, 150 watts, 200 watts, and 300 watts. The mercury vapour tubes used in the talisman bracket, as auxiliary lighting units, were of the standard Westinghouse make, rated at 60 watts, and the average candlepower output of one of these tubes was 1,025 cp. The results of the tests are presented in table I., and they show that the lamp fixtures containing the mercury vapour tubes gave on the average 24 per cent more candlepower output than did the fixtures without the auxiliary tubes."	1912	1958.494
It insists that the smoke of the factory shall not blacken the home of the worker, and that the waste of the slaughterhouse shall not poison the milk of the nursery. It compels the landlord to build, and the tradesman to locate his shop, with regard to the welfare of the community as well as to their individual interests. City planning insists that the city shall have the same advantage in the race for prosperity that the individual has in his struggle for success. It insists that when a street railway company, a gas company, or a group of merchants, are given the use of public property, they shall pay the same rental that would have to be paid by any other user of the same property. 5 B OVERLOOKING THE WHITNEY BRIDGE AND THE MILLS, LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS.	1913	1902.1027
In this country they are fighting hard to maintain the same conditions in the South. And while they are busy carrying on that fight, they have no time or inclination to join the crusade for the 8 hour day, for the Insuring of the life and limb of the workingman, for a child labor law, for a pure food law or for the conservation of the health, vigour and manhood of the people. While they are calling upon the people to be content, the masters of monopolies and high finance are piling up their millions. And while they are calling upon the workers to accept lower wages and longer hours, the lords of capital are boasting of their increasing wealth and power. They are doing this just as the English capitalists and statesmen did until they were forced by the people to look after the welfare and happiness of the working class. It was not until after the Chartist movement, which was the first great uprising of the English people against the tyranny of the capitalist and landowning nobility, that the first factory, mine and mill legislation was passed. After the English people had forced their Parliament to accept the demands of the Chartists, even John Bright, who was then one of the foremost statesmen of England, admitted that the laboring people had a right to such legislation. And even then it was not until after the workingmen had won their fight in the dyeing and printing works of Lancashire that the great statesman, who stood beside Cobden on the platform and loudly proclaimed the doctrines of free trade, admitted that the labouring class had any rights that ever should be considered by the manufacturers and owners in the cotton mills.	1911	1915.1093
"If, however, one of the limits of integration is at the free end of a cantilever the expression becomes zero. The equation (3) is known as ""the double integration method"" and is one of the procedures given for finding deflections by means of the equation of the elastic line. It can only be used when the bending moment can be stated as a function of x alone or where by using the method of sections and making the bending moment a function of several variables, it can be integrated to obtain the bending moment as a function of x alone, for in the first integration the limits must be known and therefore cannot be from the fixed support in a cantilever case. The second case will be dealt with later and only the first case will be considered just now. With uniform beams, both EI and M are constants and the problem is then merely one of integration. In the case of a uniformly loaded simple beam If the limits of integration are known the deflection is given by (n) where w is the load per foot run, L the length of the beam, and M, a constant substituted from (2). Negative deflections indicate a downward motion. — The preceding method applying to the case of uniform beams is easily adaptable to beams having a constant second moment of area and variable bending moment. If the moment of inertia varies but the variation is such that M can be expressed as a function of x alone the above method will apply."	1908	1976.0592
"They have remained steadfast in the application of certain principles which have obtained in the past when they were needed and desired, but which are outgrown by our present educational needs. Definite change, however, has not appeared in every direction. The present tendency of the college is well described by President Van Hise of the University of Wisconsin as one toward ""a more extensive vocational training in the universities and liberal education in the colleges."" That is, the work of the college is tending more and more to approach the specialisation characteristic of university training, while in the university we are finding ""a liberal education, adapted to the needs of the time."" But is it really ""liberal"" education to offer liberal courses preparatory to   18  entering the professional school? I have in mind a long course in liberal studies at an excellent university, the purpose of which is to prepare for admission to the law school. The profession of the lawyer has grown so immensely in importance during the last three decades that it demands as a prerequisite for professional training and as a condition of success in one of its great fields of activity — public service — the college career. I have known a state university to be moved by a vast political upheaval to abolish its own free college of law and to require that all students in law shall come from the upper classes of the college. But is this the best way to meet our professional needs?"	1911	1926.1522

shear stress in that plane would make it a zero shear stress plane. 14.

The principal stresses in a bar are 6 tonnes per square inch and 2 tonnes per square inch, the first being tensile.	1908	1985.561
But, to come back to the present, the work performed by the New York subway systems is almost beyond comprehension. The Subway and Elevated lines, combined, moved 700,000,000 passengers in 1909. This is at the rate of 2,000,000 a day, which, for a population of 4,000,000, is equivalent to each man, woman, and child being carried every twenty-four hours. The work is done in this way: The Subway and Elevated lines, in 1909, carried 1,286,000 passengers on a single day, which is equivalent to the entire population of the United States being carried in a single day. The entire work is done with a system of automatic ticket machines, through which, in 1909, 1,000,000,000 tickets were sold. This means that 2,740,000 tickets were sold every day, or 114,000 tickets every hour, or 1,900 every minute. The largest ticket machine ever made is the one in the New York Subway, and the largest automatic ticket machine in the world is also in the New York Subway. This machine is capable of selling 250 tickets a minute, and has sold as high as 500 tickets in a single minute. There are 175 of these machines in the New York Subway, and they are located at the entrances to the stations. There are also 2,000 turnstiles, and 1,000 automatic gates, which are used to control the exit of passengers.	1913	1943.027
It is a very pugnacious Snake, and does not hesitate to attack an intruder, striking repeatedly and with considerable force. The bite is not necessarily fatal, but is dangerous, as the fang penetrates easily through leather gloves. It feeds on Frogs, Lizards, and other Snakes, and is itself preyed upon by the Eagle Hawk. The eggs are deposited in decayed animal matter, where they are hatched by the heat of the rotting substances. Genus Tropidonotus. Head not distinct from the neck. The maxillary bone carrying a poison fang, followed by 2 to 5 small teeth, which are more or less distinctly grooved. Scales smooth, directed backwards. Ventral scales rounded. sub caudals in two rows. Ovoviviparous. 1. The Brown Water Snake. Tropidonotus s. pelagicus. S 17, V 160 — 190, A 2, SC 40 — 55 pairs, or some undivided. A very variable species, common in the eastern half of Australia, and also in New Guinea and New Britain. It occurs in a great number of geographical races, which differ in colour and the number of scales. It lives on Frogs and small Fishes, and is itself harmless.	1909	1887.0709
On the roads, on market days, and in the villages, the wayfarer receives from the peasants food rather than money ; and of food the chief item is black bread. He is an erring member of the Orthodox Church, too, if he refuses the crusts that are offered him, and the loaf at whose slice his hand has been stayed by a generous giver. And a curious sight on wet days were the heaps of sodden bread in the pilgrims' tents. This, too, was brought with them from the roadside; but being of course uneatable, it was strewn about the floor of the tent to absorb the mire. Each morning and each night it was renewed by fresh crusts from without, and each morning and night, as the tentkeeper sent his men forth to clear a way through the mud, the rotting mass was carried away. 166 No pilgrim dispensed with the leather flask of vauda, or corn drink, that he fastened to the front of his sledge. Seldom or never was the thirsty water taken on the road; it was for drinking only on the road back. For this, indeed, is one of the laws of pilgrimage — that wayfarers shall drink no water on the road to the shrine, but shall reserve their thirst for the return.	1913	1881.04
on the optical properties of prisms is similar. Section III. deals with the perception of colour and the visible spectrum, and Section IV. with the determination of the visual angle and the measurement of acuity. Section V. is devoted to the stereoscope and stereoscopic vision, and Section VI. contains a number of miscellaneous problems, including the determination of the sensations corresponding to different intensities of light, the laws of contrast, etc. A good many apparatus are required for this work, but they are mostly within the means of the ordinary student, and the book will be found useful as a guide by those who wish to give themselves a course of practical exercises in this branch of optics. Optical Instruments. By A. H. W. Benton, B.Sc. (U.P., 1911.) THIS book is a short introduction to the subject of Optical Instruments, intended for students of Physics and Engineering. It is thus of a different character from the two former books mentioned in this review. The first three chapters are concerned with the theory of the optical properties of lenses and mirrors, and the derivation of the corresponding lens formulce. These chapters are well written, and the explanations are clear. In the second part of the book, however, the author seems to have attempted rather too much, and the treatment is not on the same level as that of the first part.	1912	1888.777
"8 ""In certain of the Bionympha parasites the presence of two or more parasites in a given host has been observed. This has been recorded previously by several authors, but has been considered a rare occurrence. In B. asteris, for example, one or more cases of superparasitism have been observed in 7, or 5.5 per cent of the total number of parasites reared. In these abnormal hosts two parasites were found in 69 per cent of the cases, three in 27, four in 3, and five in 1, while six parasites were never found in a single host. The number of eggs laid by the female when superparasitism occurred was not increased, but was the same as in normal hosts, while the duration of life of the parasite was slightly prolonged. (M. M. Weed, ""A Study of the Life History of Bionympha asteris, "" Journ. Econ. Ent., III., 1910, pp. 458-463.) 8 Moulton (""Some New and Little Known Species of the Genus Aphelinus, "" Journ. Econ. Ent., II., 1909, pp. 73-79) has shown the hyperparasitism of one species of Aphelinus upon another."	1911	1944.1425
It stood at the crucial point. The rivers which watered the eastern and southern sides of the greater part of the island, and the lines of road from the south to the north which lay along the eastern coast or through the valley of the Severn — these were all confronted by the Pennines. They could not be left unguarded, and they were not unguarded. It is to these hills and to the legions which established and maintained nearly impassable barriers at their most favourable passages, that we owe the fact that the English nation is a nation, and not an assemblage of tribes. Much has been said about the unorganised character of the Roman occupation in Britain. The phrasing of the statements commonly made is objectionable ; their content is not. The occupation in the Lowlands was thoroughly organised. The remains of the Roman empire are found there, not as relics of a sojourn, but as the remnants of a great system projected and carried out with a high degree of efficiency. Among the seven or eight large cities of Roman Britain, four — Londinium, Eboracum, Corstopitum, and Lugu valium — were in the true Lowlands, while the fifth, Deva, was situated at the furthest point on the estuaries of the Mersey which could be reached by the legion stationed there for the protection of the Welsh from the depredations of the English. But the whole aspect of the Lowlands in the neighbourhood of the cities was changed.	1912	1867.2147
"6 How To Make Photographic Prints From Lantern Slides. By W. T. E. corley. General Principles. Twenty-five years ago anyone who desired to possess a photograph of any special subject had in the majority of cases to have recourse to a professional photographer to obtain it, but at present the facilities for obtaining photographs, satiating the desires of the amateur who has the time to pursue the matter, are so numerous and so complete that it is possible for anyone who desires to make their own prints to do so. By far the most immediate and direct way of acquiring a practical knowledge of photography is to use a ""box"" camera and dry plates. The amateur learns the routine of exposure, development and printing, and when this has been achieved he will have acquired sufficient technical knowledge to feel quite at home in buying his own equipment. The latter is very often the difficult part to a beginner, but by taking this routine of proceeding — one at a time, and not trying to buy everything at once he will find no difficulty in the matter, and he may at the end of his first season have one or two cameras, a decent adapter, a dozen or so plates, and, if he is fortunate, a small slide or rollfilm apparatus. Should the latter, however, come last in the list it will be found the most useful, for, provided one has the means of developing the film it is very easy to make good exposures; and provided one has the means of projecting the slide one may use it for any purposes for which it may be required."	1912	1920.1342
"One. Boom! Two. Boom! Three. Like that, Signora, and then the clangour of frying fish. And it does not fry fish — no. It plays 'God Save the Queen' on tin horns.

The Signora should see."" I was almost tempted to walk round by the Frari to judge for myself; but I did not.

"And she looked up at him with wide, glowing eyes, her face still so close to his that her hair brushed his lips, and he could feel the warmth of her cheeks and chin. He did not answer her for a moment, but his hands went down from her shoulders and clasped her waist, and he drew her face still closer to his, until their foreheads touched, and their breath mingled. ""Doris!"" he said at last, and his voice was low and hoarse, ""if I could only believe that! If I could only believe that a child of ours would be welcome to the world, or that I could ever be worthy of you! If I could only believe that I could ever be anything but a beggar, and a penniless one at that, and a man who has no right to even look at the woman who is noble enough to love him!"" ""Hush, hush!"" she said, and her eyes grew darker, and a shudder ran through her. ""It is not true, and you must not say it. It is the money which has poisoned your mind, and turned your love into a disease. It is the lack of it which has made you think you have lost your manhood. It is the fear of it — of losing it — which has made you act like a madman."	1909	1904.7
All the other parts of the face are in shadow. This is a very pleasing effect, and will be found very easy to make. The second illustration shows the same lighting, only the subject is looking directly at the camera, and the light is a little lower, the shadow cheek having lost the highlight. To make this, the subject must be placed on the line between the light and the camera, and the light must be lowered, and the camera raised a little to get the shadow cheek out of the shadow. This is a little harder than the first, but when you know how to do the first, the second is easily made. The third illustration shows the same lighting, only the subject is looking a little away from the camera. The light is a little lower, and the face is turned more away from the light than in the first illustration, and the nose and cheek are brought a little nearer the light. This is a very pleasing effect, and the light on the nose and cheek is made by the turning of the face away from the light. The fourth illustration shows a very pleasing effect, and one that is very popular with the people. The light is a little lower than in the first illustration, and the face is turned a little more toward the light, and the light eye is a little higher than the shadow eye.	1912	1895.357
"But, at least, I can see you do not mean to make a fool of yourself. You know what you're about. You are quite determined to marry her ? "" "" Quite."" "" And you are determined to leave Coryston and its affairs ? "" "" Yes."" "" And you are prepared to say good-bye to me — to your own mother ? "" "" Not good-bye to you. I am not going to cut myself off from all the home ties. I shall be in England a good deal. I shall always want to see you, to help you — if you ever need it."" "" If I ever need it ! "" Her voice rang out with a sudden bitterness. "" I have lived to need many things — and many people."" She turned away from him, and walked to the end of the room. The mood of the two combatants had now become clear to them both. For Arthur it had the quality of a grim satisfaction. He had not meant to break with his mother in this way, and he had been hoping to do it without a quarrel. But now he was aware of a sense of relief. He had dealt his blow, and had nothing to hide. And with it there had fallen on him the heavy conviction that his mother had never quite so completely possessed her resources either in mind or body as at this moment."	1913	1916.348
The new philosophical sects that arose in Alexandria were all more or less coloured by this romantic spirit; and although the Alexandrian library was founded in 330 B.C., the first three or four centuries A.D., during which the library was at its zenith, were a period of very active philosophical and religious speculation. The most important of the new sects was the one that originated in the teachings of Epicurus, who was born 342 B.C. and died 270 B.C. It was this sect that provided the material for the most important literary product of Alexandrianism, the Mediseval Epicurean poem. The most famous representative of this religious school was the Roman poet Lucretius, who lived from about 95 to 55 B.C. He was a disciple of Epicurus and a typical representative of Alexandrianism. The first part of his great poem, De Rerum Natura, is a defence of the Epicurean doctrine of the existence of the gods, and of the immortality of the soul; the second part rejects this doctrine and accuses Epicurus of having been unfaithful to his own teachings. The third and fourth parts, which are the most famous ones, give an account of the teachings of Epicurus on matter and its movements. The fifth part describes the romantic origin of the gods, and the sixth part describes the romantic origins of magic and the superstitions of mankind.	1913	1882.9473
The reason given for this reduction in the number of ships was the necessity of effecting economies. It was urged in support of this drastic revision of the naval programme that the total length of the fleet, as it stood, was sufficient to guarantee the maintenance of the overseas trade of the country. A little investigation would have shown that this argument was based upon a complete misconception of the conditions under which our trade is carried on. In the first place, it is not by the length of the fleet, but by its fighting power, that its capacity to protect our trade should be measured. Our trade routes are patrolled and protected by ships engaged in the service of foreign Powers as well as by our own warships, and the length of the respective fleets is not the determining factor in deciding which of the rival Powers shall have the command of the sea in time of war.	1907	1907.1141
You will see at once how the Socialist movement differs from all reform movements. You will see at once that it is not simply a movement to improve the conditions of life. It is not simply a movement to abolish poverty. It is the movement to abolish the system which produces poverty. And you will see also that the movement must stand or fall by this position. The moment it gives up this position, the moment it degrades itself to the plane of a mere reform movement, it loses its power to inspire, to unite, to attract, to command the loyalty of the best elements of society. It becomes just one of many movements, to be measured by the same test of results, just one of many movements, which sooner or later will be abandoned because they produce no results commensurate with the time and labour expended.	1911	1962.1469
"As the sun began to set, I turned to make my way back to the boat, and saw the afternoon scene repeated on the shore, but with the added splendour of the sunset glow on the buildings. The mosques and minarets were silhouetted against a background of crimsoned sky, and gaudily clad women and children were wading in the shallow water, gathering the day's catch of fish. The next day I returned to the island of Heybeli, and thence to the larger one of Prinkipo. As we approached the village of the latter, I noticed a large building with a red roof, and asked its name. "" That is the palace of the German emperor, "" was my answer. "" When he comes here, he stays there for a month or more."	1913	1881.5801
"They believe that it is a means of attaining emancipation and an escape from the cycle of rebirth. The suicides of widows by sati are believed to be the most meritorious of all, and the goddess Durga, to whom they are offered, is thought to be specially propitiated by them. When a widow burns herself on the funeral pyre of her husband, she is worshipped as an incarnation of the goddess, and is addressed as "" Mother "" and "" Queen."" The act is supposed to ensure for her eternal union with her husband, and her descendants are promised prosperity and long life. It is said that, at the festival of Durga Puja, the households of widows who have committed sati are represented by mud images, which are worshipped and then thrown into the river."	1908	1898.9994
This is a good way to proceed, but it is not the best. A better way is to have the brush mounted on a handle about a foot and a half long, so that one can very lightly and slowly stroke the plate from a distance of a foot or so. The plate is first placed in a plate holder and a piece of black cardboard is slid in in front of it. The brush is then stroked very lightly over the cardboard. If there is any dust on the plate, the brush will remove it, but it will also make it very plain that the plate is not entirely free from dust. And, what is more, it will show that dust particles are so large that they may be seen moving over the surface of the black cardboard.	1912	1942.0989
"The boatmen were not at all pleased with the addition, for the bucks are constantly quarrelling with each other, and they were afraid that the presence of the hunters would keep them awake at night and cause them to be irritable and bad tempered during the day. The event proved their fears to be only too well founded, and on the third day after the arrival of the bucks at camp the whole party were involved in a general free-for-all fight, and had to be separated by the white men. I took no part in the fight, but I did my best to keep the ruffians apart for the remainder of the journey, but the ruffians themselves did their best to further each others' desires and plans. As I have said, the river was in a swollen condition, and from the very start the paddlers had to work with all their might to keep the canoes from being whirled back with the current. The ""ballyhoo"" leaked badly, and the men had to continually dip water out with bowls. When we camped that night, I found a foot of water in the bottom of the craft. It was necessary to lighten the load, so that the passage of the rapids would be possible. The next day was no better, but worst of all, we had to go over very bad rapids which, in the low water season, can be easily walked over, but which at this time made a roaring cascade, with five or six separate channels, over and between the rocks. In these rapids the ""ballyhoo"" was nearly lost, and the ""kekar"" was lost altogether."	1913	1891.1082

—Henry VIII. 1. 3. The reign of Elizabeth was one of the most brilliant, not only for England but for France also. But in the time of the first Stuart, when Monnet was writing, France had already regained the ascendency in the arts of peace, and the reign of Louis XIV., which began in 1643, gave her a lengthened lease of the empire she had won. The splendour of that monarch's Court, with its never ceasing round of fetes and entertainments, offered a boundless field for the exercise of the talents of painters, sculptors, and workers in gold and silver, and of all the minor arts. The painters of that period are all more or less familiar to us; but what of the gold and silver workers ? For the most part their names are forgotten, and it is only by the examination of the pieces they wrought that we can estimate their skill. To this day it is a matter of wonder to the French goldsmiths that the massive plate, the candelabra, the chandeliers, the vases, the basins, and other objects of gold and silver, which were made for the use of the French Court, should have been preserved, and in most cases still remain in a perfect state. The gold and silver plate belonging to the Crown of England has undergone a similar fate; but much of it is of no artistic value.	1912	1863.7211
To the worker himself it would mean increased efficiency, decreased fatigue and lessened danger to health and life. To the employer it would mean a higher standard of work, a smaller percentage of accidents, and a lower death rate among his employees, and this latter, of course, means reduced insurance rates. It would be the combined action of employers and employees which would bring about the desired result, and in recommending such action the Committee of the Insurance Institute of the United Kingdom is following the general principle which underlies its establishment and working. It is to be hoped that the present Report will be the beginning of a movement which will have far reaching results. APPENDIX I RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE NORTHERN COUNTIES SECTION OF THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AT ITS MEETING HELD AT NEWCASTLE ON TYNE ON 7TH MAY, 1910. (i) That this Section, recognising the importance of the question of the lighting of factories, and of the new provisions of the Factory Act, urges on the Council of the Insurance Institute of the United Kingdom the desirability of appointing a Committee to consider the subject, in conjunction with other Committees already formed or likely to be so formed, and to report on the following points: (a)  The best means of artificial lighting, having regard to health and efficiency. (b)  The most suitable form of light for measuring purposes, and the most practical means of measuring illumination.	1912	1923.4125
"Happiness, in the sense of the feeling of pleasure, is the reward which positively follows every step that is taken along the road of absolute values. Not the least shadow of the assumption that happiness means the simple and selfish satisfaction of the desires of the individual has crossed the mind of the author of these pages. His idealist friends have taught him that the true happiness — the worthy reward for every struggle, the outcome of every work, the harvest for every sowing — is the happiness of the community, to be finally attained through the absolutely valuable actions, large and small, of the individuals who compose it, actions which are independent of the chance individual desires for pleasure. The consciousness of having done a single absolutely valuable deed, however small, is already a precious reward, far more precious than the feeling of pleasure which may follow any amount of actions done for the sake of personal gain. The feeling of having done such a deed could not be robbed from so-called idealists by any unkindness, injustice, or suffering in the world. It lifts us above all that. It creates the only true nobleness. In this sense, to call a man an ""ideal ist"" is the highest praise that can be given him. In this sense, to be an ""idealist"" is the greatest privilege."	1909	1892.452
I was getting frantic. I rose to a sitting posture, and thrust my hand into the breast of my nightdress, where my revolver was concealed, and assured myself that it was in working order. (This was one of the occasions on which I did not carry revolvers in my hat or in my walking stick, because I had not any of both articles on me.) At this moment the burglar, who was doing his best to shove me aside, caused the toes of one of his shoes to come in contact with the end of an umbrella lying on the floor between us, and the result was that the umbrella became dislodged, and gave the burglar a tremendous rap on the shin. He uttered an oath, and, losing his balance, fell over me on to the floor, striking the back of his head heavily against the leg of a small table.	1906	1891.5607
There is, however, a vast and rapidly increasing army of men and women who are uniting in a great movement to destroy the power of corporate greed, and the selfishness which, having received its share of the good things of life, is indifferent to the suffering of its less fortunate brothers and sisters. It is not alone in the United States that this movement is gathering strength. Every day the consciousness of the danger from this peril is increasing. It is the first great step in the movement to make all men and women recognize the fact that they owe a duty to their fellow men, that they must not be satisfied to receive and enjoy all the blessings of life, but must give back to society a full share in service; that to be a noble man or woman one must contribute to the welfare of the State, that the State must be protected against the greed of the few who would rob all by the ownership of all.	1911	1902.724
"As a writer of the short, epigrammatic and stinging paragraph, Shaw is without a peer. The essays, prefaces and epistles are masterpieces of invective and irony. His brilliant epistles to the London papers attacking the pretensions of the ""legitimate"" drama, ridiculing the absurdities of the Censorship, or defending the right of an author to write as he pleases, are classics in their way and deserve to be collected in book form. There is not space to discuss Shaw's plays individually or even to mention those not described in the preceding pages. Only his most important works have been considered and they have all been taken from the first period of his activity as a playwright. At the end of this period, in 1898, was written ""The Devil's Disciple,"" the first of his historical plays. Shaw's historical figures conform in no respect to the accepted idea of such characters. They are utterly unheroic. Joan of Arc is an ordinary kitchen wench, Caesar a commonplace politician, O'Shea a bumptious solicitor, and Disraeli a wretched little Jew of no importance. It is a pity that Shaw has never devoted himself to a systematic history of biography. Whenever he steps aside from the dramatic vagary, his biographical instinct is seen at its best. The short, pungent, shrewd character sketches of the Shaw person in the preface to ""The Historical Plays"" are a delight to the reader."	1911	1952.867

The first set of prints showed the fruit so large in proportion to the plates that one could not tell what they were raised upon. The second operator had given them the right proportion to give the idea of the kind and size of the fruit raised, and the prints were satisfactory. And so we might run on with examples of the importance of giving thought to the matter of accessories in all lines of photography, but enough has been said to impress the need of this thought. Have you ever noticed that the best prints are just a little larger than the average size? There is a reason. It is because more care and thought has been given to the making of such prints than to the average, and the result is apparent in the finished work.	1912	1924.8713
A gramophone record is prepared by coating a disc of glass with a thin layer of collodion, which, when dry, is polished with a smooth cloth. The polished layer is then painted over with a thin wash of fine, white or light collodion, which is allowed to dry. A second layer of the white collodion is then applied, dried, and polished with a cloth. The disc is now ready to be mounted on the gramophone, while the reproducer is fitted with a steel point. In operation, the reproducer point presses against the disc, and during the forward movement of the reproducer the point cuts a groove in the white collodion layer, removing a stripe, or ribbon, of this layer. When the reproducer is drawn back the point cuts a similar groove a little higher up so that the grooves cross, forming an irregular, cross-like mark. This reproducer is arranged to move back and forth, the point tracing the grooves in the ribbon. To obtain a perfect record, the reproducer must be fitted with two points, one on each side, so that one may be used while the other is being sharpened. When a record has been properly made, a negative is exposed on sensitised glass (wet plate) in a camera, in which is mounted a sensitive flame, inside the lens tube, instead of a lens.	1912	1917.4799
91. A single Concentrated Load on an Arch. — Let a simple arch of the form of a segment of a parabola be supported on two vertical piers A and B. This arch has an inclination of a tangent of zero angle at the piers, and it will be assumed that the tangent angles increase from zero to a maximum at mid span, and then decrease back to zero at the other pier. These assumptions, which are usually verified by experience, define very completely a class of simple arches. A concentrated load P is carried by the arch at a point C, which is the intersection of the vertical through P with the curve. The following quantities must be determined in order to complete the discussion of the equilibrium of the arch under the action of the load P : the reactions R, and R,, the moments MA and MB at the piers, and the tension H at the supports.	1908	1952.0912

CHAPTER VIII THE GERMAN NIGHT ATTACK ON LONDON I — THE CAPTURE OF THE CITY On the night of September 27 the Germans made their second great attempt to capture London. This time they were completely successful. The attack began about nine o'clock, and when the first rays of dawn broke over the stricken city the German flag floated triumphantly from the Tower, while the wrecked and burning remains of the British capital lay at the feet of the conquerors. The defence of London was again entrusted to the London Territorials and the National Guard, and the gallant little army, fighting in defence of their homes, showed the same splendid courage and determination as on the previous occasion. But the odds were too great. The German forces which attacked London that night were estimated at 200,000 men, supported by a hundred guns and a large number of aeroplanes. The attack was delivered simultaneously at six different points, and the defenders were gradually surrounded, and, after a desperate struggle, overwhelmed. The attack began with a heavy bombardment from the German artillery, which had been secretly brought into position during the previous days. This was followed by a furious onslaught by the German infantry, supported by machine guns and hand grenades. The defenders fought with the utmost bravery, and for a time the outcome of the struggle was in doubt. But the odds were overwhelming. The Germans, who had been holding back during the previous days, had been reinforced, and the final desperate effort to save London was doomed to failure.	1906	1898.2992
He would hold back Life as he points to the pyramid, to the Parthenon, to the Embankment of Babylon. But Life will not be held back. The call of the present is too insistent. The vital, throbbing, pulsing present will not be denied. It drags Knowledge on, and so he runs close behind Life, his face to the back, his feet to the front. Sometimes he gets a backward glance, as he suddenly turns round in the race, and sees the past alive behind him, and instead of the monuments already there, he sees the moving theatre, the ever changing scene, the scene that made the monuments which he admired. And so he speaks of the man of to-day, the man who fought for freedom, who gave up the semblance, who lived life. No, he does not speak of the dead; in truth, his march is with the living. Freedom and Life and Knowledge are the drivers of the modern pageant of human progress. They are the Three Fates. They put the threads into the distaff, and follow with the scissors. The garland of the present ends in the sepulchre. The wand of the magician who delays time suddenly turns us to the graves. The very elements that make the present seem real, vanish. We are in the land of shadows. A bit of gray appears against the modern scene, and a shadow steps upon the stage. It is the shade of the past.	1911	1939.4066
To be sure, the springs are the first object of interest to the visitor. He has no sooner settled himself in his hotel than he sets out to inspect the scene of the most important of all Carlsbad's daily ceremonies, the drinking of the waters. The springs bubble up through the flagging of the colonnades, and each spring has its own pavilion or shelter, built above it like a pagoda. The pavilions are of different styles, but they are all of wood, and they are all dainty, and they all have a gayly painted signboard over the spring, inscribed in Latin and German, but chiefly in that tongue, with the virtues of the water, the diseases for which it is a specific, the temperature of the spring, and the number of the fountain.	1913	1897.2867
In the following days, however, it was not resentment that predominated in her mind. It was rather an effect of the chaplain's words, of their public character, of the roll of them in the stillness, of the curious staring silence that had followed. At first, indeed, she had no eyes for Newbury, and he was obliged to turn and speak to her. She felt all at once, though, that he was almost more conscious of the sensation produced than she was. He seemed to be asking himself what the others would say, thinking of the gossip in the college, of the comments of the fellows. He appeared to have forgotten her in the moment of stress, to be absorbed in the general curiosity about the bride and bridegroom.	1913	1891.4545
The mean angle of inclination of the resultant from the 4 blades is 1 tan a = = 0-8-. Hence 19-0 lbs. x -8 = 15-2 lbs. per blade. At the 1st blade 19-0 lbs. 2nd ,, 15-2 „ 3rd 11-5 „ 4th „ .... 7-8 „ The lateral force on the 4 blades = 53-5 - 56-5 lbs. The value of the lateral force for a single blade is obtained by multiplying the lateral force on the 4 blades by 4, and dividing it by 3, thus : — 4 x 57-5 = 76-67 lbs. This is the theoretical value. In actual practice the mean lateral force for the type of propeller considered is about 70 percent, of the above, or about 54-6 lbs. per blade. On this value is based the breaking strength of the blade. A comparison of the breaking and working stresses is as follows: — Breaking Stress per Square Inch. Working Stress per Square Inch. Steel Bronze.... 2,500 1,500 640 420 The mean pitch of this propeller is 4 ft. and the maximum depth is 6 ins. Using a mean diameter of 5 ft. and a maximum depth to diameter ratio of -2, we have a mean ratio of about -12 for the design. The stress on the root seam is theoretically 1-3 times the stress on the section taken through the centre of the blade at the maximum depth.	1912	1928.2122
"She knows that they do not. The Sydney Bulletin, that "" organ of the Australian labour party, "" which has been so much quoted in these pages, has recently devoted the whole of its leading article to an appeal to the trade unions of Australia to break all connection with the unions of India. ""As for the Asiatic unions, "" it says, ""we have no use for them. They are not unions in the British sense. They are organisations for spreading sedition and anarchy. They are not concerned with the eight hours day or the welfare of the working man. They are the tools of the Theosophical Society, and of the Theosophical Society's tools, the Irishmen and Fenian Englishmen who, since the death of Parnell, have been looking about for a new man to use as a catspaw."	1914	1933.9843
"Chapter IV The Day before the War THURSDAY, July 30th, 1914, dawned bright and clear, and at breakfast it was suggested that the coming Sunday should be observed as ""the Day of National Thanksgiving."" We all, of course, hoped that war would be avoided, but it was generally felt that Sunday would be none the less a suitable day for thanksgiving for our great peace time victories. From breakfast we went down to the park, and in the afternoon we visited the town, where we had tea, and walked about among the crowds, gazing at the large crowds that gathered round the various recruiting posters, and round the billeting boards. We returned to camp at sunset, and at 10 p.m. the Colonel held a campfire parade, at which he read us the following proclamation: — WAR OFFICE, Whitehall, S.W., July 29th, 1914. (Late) The following announcement is published by the authority of the Secretary of State for War: — His Majesty's Government have received from the German Government an ultimatum demanding that the mobilisation of the Russian army should cease. The ultimatum contains a threat that in the event of refusal the German troops will be ordered to cross the Russian frontier and will be mobilised against France. His Majesty's Government have received from the French Government an assurance that they have not mobilised their army, and that they have no intention of mobilising it except in agreement with the Russian Government."	1906	1900.4818

In the South he has no superior among the candidates, and among the progressives of the West he is, we believe, at least second. Only behind La Follette would he be, at the present time, among the progressives of the West. The Wilson men claim that with his candidacy the old line Democrats of the South, who have always been opposed to any Republican or progressive Republican influences in the Democratic party, have nothing to fear, while the progressives of the West will be convinced that he will not desert them, as Bryan did, after he was elected, and go back to the old line Democrats. In fact, they say that after the election he will be progressive enough to please even La Follette, and that if La Follette should be selected for the Vice Presidential nomination, he would not be more progressive than Wilson.	1911	1897.1039
"Many have been induced to join the League who have no actual knowledge of the principles for which the League stands, and who have no other motive for joining than to gratify the desires of those who are active in the movement. Doubtless, many have been attracted by the ""prestige"" which the League has acquired in some way. What that prestige is, and how it was acquired, we shall be able to show later. The fact that a certain number of influential citizens are enrolled in the membership of the League is not necessarily a matter for congratulation. There is no doubt that the medical profession, as a whole, is more or less misled in the matter, and that many of these influential citizens have been induced to join the League on the strength of the plausible statements made to them by those who are active in the movement."	1911	1878.1449

He was the only child she had, and he was devoted to her, as she was to him. They lived at Verdayne Court, an old red brick pile, with a moat and a few oaks, by way of park, in the very centre of the county of Sussex, and a few miles from the South Downs, the sea, and the little town of Castlemere, where the Verdaynes had always lived, and where they had always been the most important persons. Paul had been away from home for a year or so, and it was only on this his first visit during that time that he had seen the new governess. She had been in service for a year and a half; she was a pretty girl, with brown hair and blue eyes, and a complexion like a wild rose. Paul looked at her several times before he found out that she was the new governess, and when he did make the discovery he felt the same sort of annoyance that one might feel if one was bitten by a wasp without having seen it! The Lady Henrietta Verdayne was not a woman to have a governess for herself. She was about forty ; tall and thin and fair, with a long neck, and a beautiful pale face, with blue eyes and a small mouth.	1909	1892.1444
The bacilli multiplied in the lepers, but they themselves did not appear to be infectious, since they did not spread from one part of the body to another. The disease was, however, much aggravated, and the patients died more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. It is to be hoped that further investigations will be made into this curious mode of infection. 1 Zschokke. loc. cit. p. 103. 2 M. Fischer and H. Weyl. loc. cit. 3 H. Fischer. loc. cit. 4 K.

"Perhaps this is why one or two papers have lately been refusing to advertise or review certain works of art? The whole point however was put into a nutshell by the Rev. Or. Campbell when he said that "" the difficulty was to separate literature and art from what was merely vicious, and that it was sometimes difficult to tell whether a book was literature or not."" After some further remarks from Dr. Campbell and the llev. Or. Percy Gardner, in favour of the censorship, and some others like Mr. Murray and Mr. St. Loe Strachey opposed to it, the question was summed up by Mr. Kier Hardie. He asked the Attorney General whether Her Majesty's Government intended to extend the law of obscene libel so as to include libel of deceased persons  February 1, 1912 204 THE FREEWOMAN and affirming the facts of their lives and actions?"	1911	1898.5363
of carbon, and many of them not over 2 percent. of carbon, and in addition to the carbon they may contain small percentages of silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulphur, but these latter elements are present only in small quantities, and the materials used in producing the steel are selected with care so as to avoid injuring the quality of the finished product by the introduction of harmful impurities. These elements are not all harmful if present in small quantities, and if the steel is to be used for purposes where the strength is most essential, such as structural work, the mild steels are made with a larger percentage of manganese and a smaller percentage of phosphorus and sulphur, but these latter elements are often allowed to be somewhat high when the steel is intended for wire drawing, and then the manganese is kept low, as a high percentage of manganese decreases the ductility of the steel.	1908	1903.2546
It is estimated that at least a thousand Germans went to their last account in these two barricades. The enemy succeeded in gaining the breach just as a rush of the volunteers, who had been waiting in the houses near at hand, was made. The result was that the Germans got a foothold, and the poor defenders, who had fought so gallantly and so desperately, were forced to retire through the brickfield at the back of the barricade, where, however, they were reformed, and made a final stand under the leadership of Major Harkison, of the Royal Field Artillery. The final act of this terrible drama took place in a clay pit behind the barricade, and there the gallant band of something like three hundred heroes died to a man fighting like devils.	1906	1887.9036
The practice of the English women, especially the militant Suffragist, is to assume and to insist that the men of England are very much in the wrong, and nothing could serve better to the end in view than the blocking of the safety valve. But it is a very one sided quarrel, and that, no doubt, accounts for its unendingness. The men have no escape. They must remain, whether willing or unwilling, in the role of designated Oppressors. And it is a quarrel which has lasted so long that its very nature has been changed, and the male party in the dispute has been deprived of the most important of his original motives. The first and chiefest of his original motives was the impulse to protect. He is now, however, no longer in a position to protect. The women have taken the protection out of his hands. They have begun to protect themselves, and it is because they have begun that the quarrel has now become so bitter and so unending. The English male of the English female is, as a matter of fact, very much in the wrong. He is in the wrong not because he is a man, but because he is an English man. He is not, thank God, as a race, so very much like a Wellsian prototype of the New Woman. He has not that cold, severe, scientific, and, above all, that contemptuous attitude towards the woman and her functions.	1911	1884.857
"Albinia sighed. "" My dear, you cannot go on summing up the responsibilities of this neighbourhood for a hundred and fifty years in that way. Do be reasonable! Lord Coryston never had a mother before, and — "" "" He does not possess a mother now,"" interrupted Lord William, looking haughty. "" I know all that, William. But you cannot expect a woman to feel the same as a man. She is not like a soldier who has given his oath and accepts without grumbling any fate that may befall him. She is a woman, and — and the boy has been driven to her."" Lord William rose, and stood with his back to his wife, looking out of the window. "" Driven to her, Albinia?"" he repeated, slowly. "" Driven to her? You mean that, do you?"" "" I do,"" she said, with spirit. "" You know you do not mean it!"" he said, turning sharply round. "" It is an accusation against me."" "" I only mean that the boy has been harshly treated."" "" He has been spoiled from his birth, and he will come to no good. I hear of nothing but his selfishness, his wilfulness, and his extravagance."" "" That is what his guardians say, William. You have never seen him."" "" No, I have not seen him, and I do not wish to see him."" "" Why are you so bitter against him? Is it because he is a Coryston, and — and it has been foretold that he will destroy our race?"" "" It is foretold,"" he said, slowly, "" that he will destroy our race, and there is a prophecy about a plague, in which the lords of Coryston will perish — "" "" Yes,"	1913	1904.5826
To those who have followed the line of the Roman roads in this district, it will be evident that the Romans possessed a very complete knowledge of the country. They had taken advantage of the passes and had constructed their roads along the easiest routes. They had also selected their camps and fortresses with great care. The camp at Kirkby Thore was selected, not merely as a convenient point on the road, but because it was a place of great natural strength. It is a large flat area, completely surrounded by a natural earthwork in the shape of a steep escarpment, with a deep ravine running at the foot of the escarpment on two sides, while on the other two sides are marshes and a lake. This was a place which could easily be defended, and which could be made a stronghold. The Roman road northward from this point, up the valley of the Eden, passed through a perfectly level stretch of country, and it is evident that the Romans would have no difficulty in constructing their road. They would have to deal with no great obstacles, and would be able to keep the line straight. The camp at Birdoswald is another instance of the care with which the Romans selected their strongholds. It is situated on a level plateau, surrounded on three sides by a steep escarpment, with a deep ravine at its foot, while on the fourth side is a marsh.	1912	1881.6578
Behind the Sachsen came the old pre dreadnoughts, the Wittelsbach, the Kaiser, the Kaiser Friedrich, the Wurtemberg, the Baden, and the Thuringen, while the rear guard was formed by the five newest and largest of the German cruisers, the Roon, the Yorck, the Blucher, the Seydlitz, and the Moltke. The first three of these were the latest type of armoured cruisers, each with eight 8-in. guns, while the last two were the newest of the battle cruisers, each with ten 11-in. guns. The British rear guard was formed by the two cruisers, the Glasgow and the Birmingham. The Glasgow, the largest of the light cruisers, had been heavily armed by Sir John Jellicoe, in his capacity of First Sea Lord, with no less than six 6-in. guns, while the Birmingham carried eight 6-in. guns and a number of quick firing 3- in. and 12-pounder guns. In addition, both cruisers were provided with torpedo tubes. They were, in fact, floating forts, and their duty was to keep the enemy's destroyers occupied while the battle ships and cruisers were engaged. The British line was formed in two divisions, the van under Admiral Hood and the rear under Admiral Sir Cecil Burney, who had under his command the battle cruisers and the Queen Elizabeths.	1906	1926.9735
In the case of the merino sheep, as in the case of the race horse, we have to do with a species which has been subjected to very severe artificial selection. In both cases the breeders believe that the characters they desire are inseparable, and that it is impossible to get a long fibre without getting a coarse one, or a fine fibre without getting a short one. In both cases the breeders are probably wrong, but they have no experimental evidence to guide them. It is easy to see how a false belief of this kind may arise. In the course of a few generations the average type of the breed will be improved in the direction desired, and a few individuals will appear which are better than the average in all respects.	1911	1928.6943
"In "" Capital "" Marx is seen at his best and worst. His method is most faulty ; and at the same time the book is a monument of industry. It is full of a patient, laborious, minute collecting of facts. So much so, that one can believe that its author, when he wrote it, was still a little under the influence of the empirical economists. He had not yet fully realised the inadequacy of the empirical method — had not grasped the truth that the collection and collocation of facts, however extensive and elaborate, does not of itself produce knowledge. It is not till Marx comes to analyse the facts that he begins to show himself the true disciple of Hegel. It is in this second volume of "" Capital "" that we see how Marx adapts his master's dialectic to the elucidation of the mystery of surplus value. But it is not merely the method he borrows from Hegel. The central idea round which the whole of Marx's system revolves is that of contradiction — contradiction in the Hegelian sense. Outwardly, i.e. in the sphere of phenomena, all seems harmonious enough. But beneath the surface, in the world of reality, two great forces are at work, and they are bound to come into conflict. They are the forces of Capital and Labour. The interests of the two are diametrically opposed. Each represents a different principle of organisation. The one is individualistic, the other collectivistic."	1908	1918.0863
"They are especially abundant on the Mitchell grass plains. I have seen them in thousands on a square mile of land, the whole surface being dotted with thousands of holes, and the toads themselves hopping about in every direction, and diving into the holes as one approached."" The holes referred to by Mr. Rose are burrows made by the toads, which are from one to three feet in length, according to the size of the animal, and go down perpendicularly for a foot or so, and then wind about horizontally. In these burrows the toads lie concealed during the heat of the day, and emerge at night, or after rain, to feed. The burrow is lined with a thick coating of slime, which is probably secreted by the animal, and serves to keep the interior moist. When the burrow is disturbed, the toad retreats to the far end, and, if pressed hard, escapes through a hole at the end of the burrow, which is covered by a flap of earth. The toad is of a greyish brown colour, with a number of prominent tubercles on the back, and is about four inches long. The eggs are laid in temporary pools, and the tadpoles are said to be of a reddish colour. In the adult toad the tubercles are said to be of a pinkish hue, and to resemble the beads of the rosary, whence the name "" Catholic Frog."" It has been said that the toad is poisonous, and that the cattle and horses which eat the young grass on the banks of the ponds in which the toads breed die."	1909	1874.5732
Your lumberman nowadays is a shrewd fellow. He studies maps. He reads reports. He gets the same books and the same information as the Forest Service. And he is up against a different sort of competition. He used to fight competition between lumber and other materials. Now he has to take into consideration competition between lumber and lumber itself, — competition between the different ways of using it. This has been brought home in the recent discussions in Maine and Michigan, where the lumbermen have set their heads together to refuse to cut at certain seasons of the year, in order to save their logs during the spring freshets, when they would be swept away and lost. They have agreed to put in booms, at considerable expense, and to build their railroads further from the streams, so as to make their camps and logging operations less convenient. Why? Simply because their biggest competitor in the lumber business is no longer the iron, the concrete, or the glass, but the telephone and telegraph. The telephone companies are building their lines of cedar, of fir, of mountain pine, of redwood. They pay cash and take the best. The railroads are taking the best in the middle Western States as fast as it gets big enough to be worth handling. They are stripping the black locust of its finest trees, so as to make sure of their telegraph poles.	1911	1944.1487
The vacant lands are mostly situated in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, Hants, Wilts, Dorset, and Somerset, and the Crown has decided to lease to county councils and other bodies under the Small Holdings Acts any portion of these lands which may be desired for small holdings. The land is of good quality, and the terms upon which it is offered are as follows : — The land will be let at a rental of £2 per acre per annum. The rent will be revised every seven years, and the tenant will be given the first option to purchase at the revised rental. The lease will be for a term of 35 years, and the land will be let subject to the following conditions: — 1.	1907	1901.6161
"He turned his back on the man and went to the door. ""But, you see, I am cured, "" the patient cried, with a sort of triumph. ""I am free. I am a man again; I am going to live my life. I am going to make up for lost time. I am going — "" Michaelis opened the door, and stood at the threshold. ""You are going to do nothing of the kind, "" he said. ""You have missed your chance; you are not going to get another."" ""What do you mean? "" ""I mean you have lived in the hospital on the charity of the State. You are going to die in the hospital, on the charity of the State. You are not fit to go into the world again; you are a man one more time and too many."" He went out, and closed the door. The patient stared at the white wall, and shook his head slowly, like a child that does not understand. ""But, I am cured, "" he murmured, ""I am free. I am a man again. I am going to live my life."" Twice, thrice, he muttered it. The third time a nurse passed, and heard. She went on to the next room, and spoke to an orderly. The patient had been a little too long on the morphine, and had a little too much pain."	1913	1931.38
The line drawn through the points is a straight line, and indicates that the relation between these two factors is a simple one. The number of repetitions necessary to cause fracture is inversely proportional to the range of stress. The experimenters, however, were unable to say whether this relation would hold good for ranges of stress higher than those shown in the diagram, as they had not the means of applying such high ranges. It would be of great interest to know the result of experiments on this subject with a non ferrous metal. The effect of the mean stress on the number of repetitions necessary to cause fracture is shown in Table II., and in Fig. 52, where the same curve is drawn for the mean stresses as was drawn for the ranges of stress in Fig. 5i.	1908	1942.5609
It was not a Spanish dance, but an imitation of the kind of dance that the American music halls used to have; and the girls were not gypsies, but the daughters of the best people in Madrid. They were the most graceful, the most beautiful, the most charming creatures that I have ever seen, and they seemed to know it, and to enjoy the fact as much as we did. They were perfectly at ease, and their delight in their art was infectious. I cannot see why a woman who is beautiful, and who can dance so that we feel how beautiful she is, should not use her beauty and her art to make money. If she likes the stage, and it likes her, I do not see why she should not go on it. There is no reason why she should not make money, and why we should not enjoy her beauty and her art as much as we can. The only reason why she should not go on the stage is that she should not have to do anything she does not want to do. And all the girls in the world should want to go on the stage, if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they can, and if they	1913	1890.3221
"""He is not; but he must be, "" she said — ""that is, if they are to be at Martover. He is sure to be there at the same time."" ""Oh, there is no doubt at all about their being there, "" he said, smiling — ""the women at least; and their leader is not one to let another take the chair at a meeting at which she is to be present. Still, I am afraid your ladyship will have to put up with Mr. Glenwilliam. There is greater danger, I am glad to say, of our friend Lord Coryston not being there. I think Lady Coryston has made him go to Egypt."" ""Probably his father also, "" she said, with suppressed bitterness. He took up his hat, and, opening the door, said, with a bow — "" I hope your ladyship will not think me intrusive in mentioning that the Ather stones are in town, and that Mrs. Ather stone is certainly going to Martover. Good night."" The moment he had said this, he closed the door behind him, and Lady Coryston heard a quick step retreating down the corridor. ""I fear there is great trouble brewing, "" said a voice at her side. She turned, and saw the new governess, Miss Hutchinson, standing near the piano. ""Is it possible you overheard all that?"" she said, with a surprised look. ""I did, "" said the governess, drawing herself up. ""I am very sorry, "" replied Lady Coryston, with a slight chill in her tone."	1913	1884.9642
To this day they furnish the principal part of the Hungarian population. They are shifty, crafty, and self seeking, but under the tutelage of the German stock they have developed an efficient and fairly honest civil service. They are about the only part of Austria-Hungary that has any respect for law and order. In stark contrast to the adaptability of the Magyar is the obstinate adherence of the Slav to his primitive ways and his stubborn resistance to the ways of western civilization. In spite of the fact that for at least a thousand years he has been in incessant contact with western civilization he has clung tenaciously to his customs, his religion, and his language. This is largely due to the fact that he has never been really conquered. During the past millennium he has been the victim of a long line of invasions and conquests, but each time he has finally succeeded in throwing off the yoke of his oppressor and has returned to the style of living of his own choice. In these repeated uprisings he has shown 19  a great talent for guerrilla warfare. The Russo-Japanese War brought this out in a striking manner. There the Russians were continually amazed and baffled by the ability of the Korean to act as a bushwhacker. He furnished the Japanese with thousands of recruits for the irregular cavalry and they proved the most effective fighters, both as guerrilla warriors and as regular cavalry, that the Japanese had.	1911	1951.3851

"Unfortunately, however, our medical freedom is being threatened. A few of our states have already passed laws which not only restrict the liberty of the citizen in his choice of a physician, but which also discriminate against the physician himself in the treatment of his patients. And all this is being done in the name of the so-called science of medicine. The medical practice acts of many states provide that a certain ""board"" shall issue certificates of competency to the physicians practising in that state. This board is made up almost exclusively of representatives of what is known as ""regular medicine, "" i. e., the practice of allopathic physicians. Each member of the board represents his particular school. The laws then provide that no one shall practise medicine in that state unless he has received a certificate from the board. Such a law virtually compels the citizen to employ what is known as ""regular medicine"" when he is sick, and it thus infringes upon his liberty. It prescribes the one school of medicine to which he must submit, and discriminates against the other schools. It thus constitutes an infringement upon the rights of the physician. For it virtually compels him to follow the one line of treatment which the board prescribes, and it thus deprives him of that liberty which is the birthright of every American citizen. In other words, these medical practice acts not only prohibit the free exercise of the citizen's rights of conscience in the matter of his health, but they also infringe upon the inalienable liberties of the physician himself. Moreover, they are undemocratic and unAmerican in spirit and in theory."	1911	1899.9318
Huntford regularly dined there every day at seven o'clock, and he was always the first to arrive. He liked the quiet   of that half hour before the others came, when he could read his papers and think. Sometimes, as on the day the fatal telegram came, he could not think; his mind was sluggish, as if drugged. He had nothing to do that afternoon, and he had gone down on Fifth Avenue to the Astor Library, to try to pass the time until seven o'clock by looking over some old books. But his heart was heavy in the still, silent library. He raised his eyes from a page of Milton that he had read over a dozen times, and went out towards the Fifth Avenue Hotel, mechanically. The sun was sinking in the west — a great red ball, looking like a huge shard of glass dropped among the smoky buildings.	1913	1918.2445
This was the first of a series of exhibitions which will be held during the winter months. The Boston Camera Club held a very interesting exhibition of lantern slides on the eighth of last April. It was the first of a series. G. W. Houghton, of the Houghton Company, of New York City, reports considerable business in tinted lantern slides. This is a very attractive form of slide and one which is coming into general use. A. E. Dutton, of the Dutton Company, of New York City, reports a steady business in his company's line of cameras. The Dutton Company is a specialty house, making only the Dutton line of cameras. The company has a very handsome catalogue out, which is sent to any address on application. Frank J. Barrit, of the Barrit Company, of New York City, recently moved into new and larger quarters at 236-238 West Twenty-third street. The Barrit Company is one of the quality houses, making only the Barrett line of cameras and photo supplies. Parker M. McCormack, of the McCormack Optical Company, of New York City, has been making a tour of the west in the interests of his company. He reports considerable business in his line of high class optical goods. J. H. Willard, of the New York Camera Exchange, reports a steady business in second hand goods. The New York Camera Exchange is a specialty house, making a business of second hand goods.	1912	1915.487
The name is not uncommon in France. It is found in Normandy, Brittany, Provence, etc. The famous French engraver, Claude Mellan, was the son of a certain Jean Mela, who signed himself, indifferently, Mela, Mele, Meleau, Meli, or Mella, according to the whim of the moment. The name, in fact, was like our own Smith, and had no fixed orthography. The French artist, who was born at Amiens in 1598, signed his works Claude Mellan, or more usually Mellan. The best known of his prints is his portrait of the young Louis XIII., the original of which is in the Louvre. He died in 1661. As for the name Garrique, it is still more variable. In the Bordeaux Registers it is found as Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq, Garriq and Garrique.	1912	1885.3273
As we marched solemnly through the dark streets the bells of Jerusalem rang out a warning to the Moslem inhabitants that the hour of morning prayer had come, and bade them hasten to the mosques. Our own church was lit up; candles twinkled in the windows of the little houses on the Mount of Olives. After a long tramp we came to Gethsemane. It was dawn now. The olive trees were ghostly white in the light. The sun rose over the Mount of Olives, and behind it the hills of Moab glowed like molten gold. In the courtyard of the Church of the Agony the ceremony began, a long, dreary service in the open air. The priests were all dressed in white robes embroidered with gold; their crowns and mitres were all made of paper, of course.	1913	1916.2151
This is indicated very clearly in the photographs at 12° and 14°. Between 10° and 12° the eddy has grown larger and a second one has appeared, while at 14° there are two well defined eddies, with a suggestion of a possible third one, while outside the even now disturbed stream, there are short lengths of unsteady flow, possibly due to the breaking away and reattachment of the eddies. It is probable that between 10° and 14° the flow has changed from periodic to aperiodic, as is indicated by later smoke experiments to be described in Section II. To be able to interpret the photographs correctly, it is of importance to note that the tail end of the aerofoil is at the right hand side of the photographs, and the upper side of the aerofoil is at the upper part of the photographs.	1912	1918.8615
"If it was here, it must be there."" And the light is in their eyes, the fever in their blood. The big country beyond the salt lakes is still a sealed book. It is the most desolate, waterless, sun blasted land on earth; the last place where man would go to look for gold. But it is the land of the great hope, the land of the great romance. CHAPTER XXV THE GREAT HOPE AND THE GREAT ROMANCE A small brass band, with a big drum, was parading the streets of Kynuna. It was the first band that had ever been seen there, and it was playing the ""Marseillaise"" with a vigour that made the listeners wince. The ""Marseillaise"" is not a tune that one cares to hear played out of tune, or played with an effort that savours of a struggle with the stomach. The day was a hot day, and the listeners were hot. They were also small in number, for the brass band was, and is, an institution of Kynuna, and the players were engaged in a fund raising effort. The big drum was decorated with a white placard, on which was inscribed in large red letters: ""For the Church of the Holy Ghost."" Kynuna is a township of one street, and that street is a long one, with a number of short cut tracks that cross it at intervals."	1913	1907.8907
They had to borrow the rest, and the interest on the loans, which was heavy, and the expenses of the organisation, which were large, ate up a considerable sum. In spite of all this, the railway is there, and the workingmen have done what they undertook to do. The province of Milan is now in a position to say that the railway is completed, and to take the next step toward its operation, which is to ask the Minister of Public Works to appoint a board of inspection. This done, the work of equipping the road and putting it in operation will be taken in hand. Probably, it will be operated, at least for a time, by the .railway companies, who already control most of the lines in the vicinity. The opening of the line will furnish an opportunity for the holding of the great annual fete of the People's Bank, which is already being talked of as a great event.	1913	1885.2123
When, in 1902, the evidence of the Beef Trust's open defiance of law and public interest was presented to a United States grand jury, it was to be expected that the exposure of the methods of such a large trust would so educate public sentiment that its existence and operations would be forced to the front in the next presidential campaign, and that some steps at least would be taken looking to a dissolution, or to a modification of its methods. But, apparently, the very influence involved in the case, fearful for the time being that some of its leaders might be temporarily inconvenienced and imprisoned, went to work, through its representative lawyers, politicians and judges, and delayed the case from January, 1902, to January, 1911 — nine years — when, on the morning of January 2, it was dismissed from the courts on technical legal grounds that might have been presented and insisted on any time during the nine years.	1911	1914.8112

WARD, Joseph, a. 43; managing director of a large firm of patent agents; a keen student of Christian Science, which he has practised with great success; won a large number of prizes for amateur photography. WARKWORTII, Lady, a. 66; has been a widow since 1906; her title is derived through her late husband, the eighth baron, who died in that year. She is a daughter of the Rev. Augustus Deacon, and was married in 1862. WARREN, Sir Charles, K.CB.., a. 80; born 1824; the son of a London merchant; entered the army as a second lieutenant in 1843, and is now a General; has served in many campaigns, including the Crimean War, and was for a long time in Egypt, where he was in command of the expeditionary force which suppressed the Arabi rebellion; Governor and Commander in Chief of Malta, 1884-6; Inspector General	1907	1884.3354
He was still the most powerful man in England. He had under his command all the forces of the Crown, he was still the governor of the King's person, and now that he was on the east side of the Severn, he was in the centre of a country well disposed to his cause. He was, moreover, in a country where he could easily obtain, and where he could easily maintain, a reputation as a formidable brigand. There were, however, several elements of danger in the position. There was, in the first place, no real guarantee that the King would not be rescued from his hands, and that the person of the sovereign would not again be free. Moreover, although he had a very considerable number of troops, he had but a small number of knights and barons.	1912	1874.7377
— Propulsion Characteristics. — The formula used for calculating engine power required was: H.P. = -f , where P = power required in H.P., R = resistance in lbs., V = velocity in miles per hour, 5252 = a constant. The resistance R was assumed to be that due to the wings only, as the machine is driven by the wings, and the resistance of the engine and other parts is assumed to be transferred to the wings by the propeller. 9. Strength Characteristics. — The power required for given acceleration was calculated from the formula: P = W x A, ^ 746 w where P = power required in H.P., W = weight of machine in lbs., A = acceleration in feet per second 2, 746 = a constant.	1912	1941.0848
The British Admiralty, however, had no faith in the Germans, and neglected all precautions. The British Ministers, who were responsible for the neglect of these precautions, were, of course, not tried by court martial. They were simply turned out of office, and went to the House of Lords as a reward for their misconduct. The German officers who were tried by court martial were, of course, innocent scapegoats. Their trial was only a farce, a mockery of justice, and it was a mockery of justice of which the German Emperor was not ashamed. 78 CHAPTER V. The German Emperor was not ashamed of this mockery of justice, because it was in accordance with the principles of his policy — the policy which he had pursued in the East and in the West, in China and in France.	1906	1892.7333
The valley is foggy because the atmospheric temperature was above the dewpoint temperature until after dark, when the air was cooled by radiation sufficiently to reach saturation. The plateau does not produce fog because the temperature fell below the dewpoint at an early hour in the evening and dew began to form and continues to form until the dewpoint rises toward morning. The dew will be heavier on the plateau than in the valley because the air is cooled below the dewpoint earlier in the evening when the atmosphere is drier, thus providing a better opportunity for heavy deposition. GROUND AND VALLEY FOG. — These two varieties of fog may be present at the same time or one may occur in the absence of the other, or both may be absent.	1913	1966.4596
"This was the only time throughout my stay in British Guiana that I had any personal feelings of fear, and even then I was convinced that there was no cause for it. It is true that the headman and one or two others were decidedly cool and aloof, but the majority of the people seemed quite unconcerned, and after the first hour or two the tension relaxed. My own bearers were decidedly worried, but I made them understand that I was not in the least disturbed, and that I certainly did not consider their lives in any danger. The cause of the white man's death was attributed to ""bad water"" — possibly dysentery. We had no bad water — the same that had served us throughout the journey — and I was not worried on that score. My chief interest was in the butterflies and birds, and my notes and observations were made with the utmost care. I secured a few fine specimens of the big orange and black butterfly, Papilio garamas, in both sexes, and also many of the beautiful blue Morpho menelaus, and a few of the large red and black P. cyrus, as well as many of the very large and brilliant blue and green Uraniae. I also secured a fine male specimen of the big black and white crane, Grus antigone, a bird which I had seen flying about the savanna from time to time."	1913	1892.7872
It matters not that the proposed remedy is a mere makeshift, and that a little thought would discover a better one; it matters not that the proposed remedy is a more serious evil than that which it is ostensibly designed to cure; it matters not that the proposed remedy is merely a ruse, a subterfuge, a means of escape from a serious situation; it suffices that the public mind has been duly impressed, and the attention of the public is focussed on the general proposition. The special interest then advances its specific demand for law or privileges: that demand is accepted as the specific remedy for the evil which the general proposition described in the campaign of education is designed to cure; and the public is led to believe that the proposed law or monopoly is the specific remedy for the evil which the general proposition, thus accepted as a truism, has described.	1911	1873.5724
But during his years of wandering he was a prey to all manner of diseases, and frequently depressed by the knowledge that his beloved books, the products of the best years of his brain, were being neglected. But not for long. The final, decisive change of fortune came along with the first signs of his approaching blindness. 45 He settled down in the little town of Naumburg, whither he had been summoned to be near his aged mother, and there, as if by the pitying hand of Fate, he was given a patron in the person of the bookseller, Ernst Schmeitzner. His uncle, the old philologist, who had never acknowledged the rupture with the family, still remembered his nephew in the matter of books, and his second cousin, the famous philologist, Ritschl, was as ready to help.	1913	1882.5653
"In 1863 a disease, hitherto unknown, had appeared among the sheep of the Vosges. In the course of two years it ravaged the entire country, and caused enormous losses. It was called ""the disease of the mou flons, "" or ""the sheep disease."" In 1866 the same disease was observed in Germany, and in 1868 in England. In 1849 Davaine had shown that this disease was caused by a microscopic parasite, which was subsequently named the ""bacillus of anthrax, "" or ""anthrax germ."" But although Davaine had succeeded in culturing the bacillus outside the body, he had failed to produce by inoculation in a healthy sheep the disease characteristic of the ""bacillus of anthrax."" In fact, he had been unable to demonstrate that the anthrax germ was the sole causative factor of the disease, and, in his own words, ""the question was still an open one."" Pasteur undertook the investigation of this disease, and in 1881 presented his findings to the Academy of Sciences. He was able to show that the disease is contagious, and due to a specific germ, the bacillus of anthrax. He proved that the anthracis germ can be cultivated outside the body and multiplied ad infinitum, and that, when injected into a healthy sheep, it produces the disease characteristic of ""the sheep disease."""	1911	1902.8026
"Besides, where were we to put them, since we haven't even barracks for our own men ? And look at the condition of the few old muzzle loaders we have. They wouldn't be of any use to us, and I believe even the enemy would refuse to accept them if we presented them with a few rounds of ammunition. No, it would seem that Garrison and Town are going to make an honourable capitulation, and all will be well.' ""'You don't know that, do you?' said I. "" ' I guess so. What more could we do? It is ridiculous to suppose we could hold out for a day against the force which must be coming up to attack us. The place would be utterly destroyed by bombardment, and it is a pity to expose it to that. I know that the Hongkong General, whose cousin is a Major in this Regiment, was considering what force to send to the assistance of Tientsin, and had almost made up his mind to take a party over himself to assist in the defence. But it is all nonsense. There is no reason why the Chinese should suffer for this, as there is no doubt we shall be obliged to evacuate the place as soon as the enemy appear before it in force. Well, we have had a pleasant little jaunt, and have gained some experience of campaigning, and I think we shall all agree that a regular Chinese army is not to be despised.' ""At eight o'clock precisely, the breakfast bell rang, and we all went down, for it was the last meal we were likely to have in a long while. The officers were all in a very solemn and thoughtful mood, and there was very little conversation at first."	1906	1886.7006
Erlcort did not like the acting saleslady. He had never seen the lady before, and he never saw her again. She was a tall, handsome woman, with a very haughty air, and a very provoking smile. He did not like the smile at all. He had seen it too often that day. It was the smile with which she met the customers who came to ask for books that were not on the shelves. It was the smile with which she met the customer who came to ask for a book that was on the shelf, but was not to be found. It was the smile with which she met the customer who came to ask for a book that had been found, but had been put back on the shelf.	1913	1931.2926
"I trust the Women's Trade Union League will seriously consider the idea of organising a local branch of its League in every branch of the A.S.R.S. throughout the country. I am sure that could be done, and that it would be of great mutual advantage. As to the League itself, I am not sure that I quite follow the plan of its organisation. I have not yet seen a copy of the proposed constitution, but I understand that there are to be both honorary and working members. I should prefer, for my own part, to see the League based on the principle of the old Co-operative Society — "" One member, one vote."" I think it would be a great mistake to allow wealthy women who happen to have leisure to take a larger part in the League's work than poorer women who have to earn their living. I also think it would be unwise to give any preferential position to working women. We all know the attitude taken up by some of the wealthier members of the Women's Trades Union League in the United States towards the working women. As a matter of fact, the wealthier women, as a class, are unfitted for this particular work, and will not be in sympathy with the women workers. I have known many wealthy women who have taken great interest in the work of the Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union, and have been willing to help educationally; but their attitude has always been that of patronage."	1911	1913.5265
But to return to the earlier route. It would seem that the great Roman thoroughfare through Dover, Canterbury, Rochester, and London, reaching the latter city by way of the iron gate in the Roman wall, which stood somewhere near the present iron gate in the Barbican, continued to serve for some time as the chief line of communication with the continent, even after the new and shorter water entrance at Porchester had been recognised as the more advantageous. 3 But during the latter half of the fourth century a great and sudden increase of traffic took place through this new entrance, in consequence of a massive reinforcement of the garrison of Britain by the Emperor Gratian, and the consequence was the making of the new road I have just referred to.	1912	1873.1139
It is the same in all large cities. Our best authorities on this subject are now convinced that the birth rate declines with improvement in the economic condition of the masses. In Germany, where the standard of comfort has been highest, the decline in the birth rate is most marked. In the last thirty years the birth rate has fallen from 37.5 to 29.5, while the death rate has fallen from 20.5 to 14.5. The population has increased, but only by 1.3 per cent, per annum, which is less than in any other country in Europe. In AustriaHungary, where the economic condition of the masses is worst, the birth rate is highest (38.9), and the increase of population greatest (1.9 per cent.). In England and Wales the birth rate has fallen from 36.4 (1861-65) to 28.4 (1902-06).	1911	1909.588
21. 2. See Chapter I, 4. of historical religions from a prehistorical animism or fetish worship that has been incubating in the race. The accidental survival of a belief in the White Queen's two impossibilities is not a little striking in view of the fact that the two impossibilities are the two most momentous experiences which can befall a man. It seems, then, that the notion of the self contained individual, whether the whole universe be supposed to be in a sense locked up in him under the ordinances of the Creator or under those of the latest psychologist, is, when it is not supplemented by the notion of an ongoing development of the race, a very powerful one. Yet the notion of the self contained individual, as we have seen, is itself a survival and an abandoned one.	1908	1953.0728

"Drift Mining In the Bering coal field the most usual method of mining is known as "" drift "" mining. In this system of working a horizontal opening or tunnel is driven into the side of a mountain and branches are then driven into the coal bed, forming a network of streets or rooms as the workings advance into the mountain. The width of the streets or rooms varies from 10 to 20 feet, and the length of the branches, or entries, is usually 100 or 200 feet, and in some places they are as long as 300 feet. In the Homer district a few mines have shafts, but this is not the case in the Bering field. In drift mining the openings must be kept free of water. In order to do this the mining companies have installed large pumps, which are kept in constant operation. The extent of the workings varies from mine to mine, but is over a mile in some of the larger mines. By far the greater part of the coal produced in the Bering field is sent out on the cars of the Alaska Northern railway, the only railway in the Bering coal field. In order to reach the coal, a branch of the main railway is taken from the head of Kachemak bay and extended inland for five miles, ending at the coal mines."	1911	1909.1161
As there is no known remedy for Yellows and Rosette, the only sure method of preventing them is to avoid planting such varieties as are known to be susceptible, and to remove and burn all infected trees. The most resistant varieties are Early Belle, Hite Beauty, Elberta, and Triumph. Of those which are somewhat susceptible, may be mentioned: Heath Cling, Hiley, and Belle Cling. Of the very susceptible, are: Early Rose, Early York, and White Heath. The following are very susceptible to Yellows and Rosette: Early Red Free, Red Rareripe, and Early Crawford. The Peach Scab may be controlled by spraying with Bordeaux Mixture in the late fall or winter before the buds swell, and again in the spring before the blossoms open. Leaf Curl. This is due to a fungus which attacks the unfolding leaves and causes them to curl and become thickened and distorted. Such leaves die and drop off, but the fungus does not seem to spread to other leaves. The disease is most serious on the Nectarines, but also occurs on Peaches. The remedy is to spray with Bordeaux Mixture in the late fall or winter before the buds swell, or in the spring just before the buds open. A second spraying in the spring after the blossoms fall is beneficial, but not essential. 38 THE PLUM AND PRUNE. 39 THE PLUM AND PRUNE.	1914	1915.8713
"We cannot accept the theory that the man who does not expose himself to danger shall be held to be a hero if he takes care of somebody else. Mr. Ismay's conduct may have been ""unselfish, humane, and brave "" in respect of the women and children, but his own personal attitude to the danger was not. He did not expose himself to the peril of drowning. He took refuge in safety. His "" unselfishness, humanity, and bravery "" stopped short at the point of danger. He did not go down with the ship. The man who runs away from danger is not in a position to boast that he leaves others to face it. There was plenty of room in the boats for all who wanted to go. There was no urgency to fill them. Mr. Ismay had nothing to do but to step into one of them himself, and to invite as many of the others to go with him as would accept his invitation. He was in a position to urge the need for their going, and he did urge it. But he stood aside while the women and children were being put into the boats. He knew that there is no urgency without the ship. He knew that the ship was unsinkable. He knew that women and children would be safely housed in the boats."	1911	1918.8323
The only way it can do so effectively is by the public itself entering into business and conducting it on the basis of cooperation rather than on the basis of competition. If cooperation is a success in all other respects, it will be a success in this respect. It is simply a question of the public owning the business which it patronises and conducting it for the benefit of the public. It is a question of the public doing its own business and retaining for itself the benefits of its own business. It is a question of the public ceasing to be the unwilling and unpaid servant of the man who is conducting business for his own benefit. It is a question of the public becoming its own master and conducting its own business for its own benefit. It is a question of the public being its own employer and of the public, through the state, employing those who are to conduct the business which the public itself owns.	1911	1934.7039

But the aggregate problem is larger than any individual, and it is with the aggregate that the statesman has to deal. The problem is to keep the total amount of labour and capital in the country employed, and to keep it employed at the highest point of efficiency. It is the problem of the nation, not of the individual; of the community, not of the township. The first step in this problem is to ascertain what is the present efficiency of the total labour and capital in the country, and what is the efficiency of the labour and capital of the separate industries. In other words, we have to measure the labour and capital of the nation, and to measure the labour and capital of the separate industries.	1911	1904.6161
"He uses it unsuspectedly, whenever he tries to make a pupil attend to something. Nor does the doctor. There is no doctor who would not, if he were honest and intelligent, feel it his duty to suggest his own confidence in the cures he prescribes. There is a school of medicine, the "" methodism "" of the old days, which by the very fact of its solicitude for the patient, by its avoidance of touch and drugs, and especially by its manifest undoubting confidence, pours out suggestive influences in a most abundant manner. It is a mistake to think that a doctor should be an indifferent person. The very fact that he himself believes in the efficacy of the remedy he prescribes, that he has confidence in the effect of the bath, of the poultice, of the bleeding, of the blister, of the diet, is already a way of communicating a suggestion, and a way which is not to be despised. Now, however, that we understand the nature of suggestibility, we can see how little there is to fear from it ; how little, for example, there is to fear from the hypnotising of a patient by the physician. We may indeed go further and say that in spite of all the exaggerated statements of some psychotherapeutists who have come to believe that suggestibility is the sole healing factor, there is no remedy the efficacy of which is not in a large measure due to suggestion."	1909	1861.7513
"For the Drug Law ""The object of the Drug Law was to prevent the manufacture and sale of deleterious drugs and medicines. It was designed to protect the consumer, and the professions of medicine and pharmacy, against the imposition of dishonest and harmful preparations. Its provisions are very simple. They require that the label on each package or parcel of a proprietary medicine shall indicate the precise article or articles of which it is composed. The law is readily complied with, but in view of the small amount of proprietary medicine sold in Canada and the importance of these articles to the public, there seems no good reason for its continuance. The enactments of the Dominion Food and Drug Act relating to proprietary medicines are duplicates of this Act. ""The articles sold as proprietary medicines in Canada are very few in number."	1911	1893.9023
When the liberated acids are shaken up with ether the butyric acid will remain in the aqueous liquid, and the oil in the ether. The butyric acid may be extracted from the aqueous liquid by a number of washings by fresh portions of ether, or a steam distillation may be resorted to. Or the liberated acids may be distilled a second time from aqueous solution and separated by fractional distillation, or the liberated acids may be saponified with larger excess of alkali, the excess of which may be titrated back, and the oil or ether extract is then distilled from the residue. M I Chemical behaviour of the volatile fatty acids. 1. Acrolein test. Add a few drops of an alcohol solution of resin to a little of the acid diluted with water and heat. A strong smell of aldehyde will be noticed. 2. Soda test.

It is believed that the control of the corporations over the legislature and the executive department of the government has been effectually destroyed. In the campaign of 1910, as indicated in the preceding chapter, the Republican party of California, through its convention, repudiated the progressive policy of the party and declared its intention to return to the corrupt reactionary methods of the past. As a result, the Democratic party had a majority in both branches of the legislature, though a minority in the state. This proposed reaction, dated from the organisation of the legislature in January, 1911. The first act of the legislature was to ignore the Democratic minority and elect Democrats as officers of the senate and assembly. The officers chosen were Edwin M. Stanton, of Santa Barbara, president pro tempore of the senate; John A. McGregor, of San Francisco, chief clerk of the senate; William H. McKinley, of Plumas, assistant chief clerk of the senate; John B. Anderson, of Los Angeles, bookkeeper of the senate; William F. White, of San Francisco, doorkeeper of the senate; F. H. Keeler, of San Joaquin, sergeant at arms of the senate; William Edward Johnson, of San Francisco, Hanscom, of Siskiyou, Charles A. McDonald, of Mendocino, and William G. Hawkins, of Santa Barbara, pages of the senate. The chief clerk of the assembly elected were Frank L. C. Chipman, of Los Angeles; Charles A. Stevens, of Butte, assistant chief clerk; John H.

But they want to be able to hang one up in their house on the wall, close to their sword and their spear, and to take it down when it is wanted, and to be able to carry it if it is needed. So far as I am concerned, I would not have a restriction on the carrying of arms for any man or woman or child. The only restriction I would have would be that a person should be medically certified as fit to carry them. If a man is not fit to carry a stick, he is not fit to carry a gun; if he is not fit to carry a gun, he ought not to carry a revolver; if he is not fit to carry a revolver, he ought not to carry a pistol; but a man who is fit to carry any of those things ought to be able to carry any — (Applause.)	1914	1920.7797
tinuous use in the brake vehicle, and points out the advantages of the brake vehicle method over the dynamo vehicle system. The paper is illustrated by a number of excellent diagrams and figures. The method of charging the batteries by the dynamo on the engine is also described. The various portions of the brake vehicle equipment are dealt with in turn, and the author concludes by giving a table of the comparative efficiency of the brake vehicle and dynamo vehicle methods. The cost of the former is found to be less than that of the latter, while the efficiency is greater. A description of the new Electric Light Equipment for the Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert is given on p. 25. The equipment was designed and installed by the General Electric Company, and the plant is illustrated by a series of excellent photographs.	1912	1904.7198
"In this body a few old, experienced legislators have insured themselves against change by making a coalition among themselves. The consequence is that after every Federal Assembly the ministry has practically the same members as before. The ministry has become a 'Pharaoh's throne.' The stability of our constitutional order does not depend on the stability of the ministry."" Bernett also called attention to the fact that nowhere is political life so dull as in the Republic of the Confederation. After this address the proposal to limit the terms of members of the Federal Council to two was adopted, and was supported by many competent men. It was also proposed that the revision should include the election of the President and Vice President by the whole people; to have only one Minister per department, instead of three, as at present; to diminish the functions of the Permanent Commission of the Council of the States; to give each canton a vote in the legislature; to regulate the taxes; to strengthen the power of the Confederation to suppress revolts and to maintain tranquillity; to enlarge the power of the Confederation and limit that of the cantons,"	1911	1920.1738
The Kaiser was our best friend. The whole thing was a monstrous lie. And yet the German soldiers were actually marching through the streets of our capital, and we were unable to drive them back. The truth was that the people had not yet grasped the full significance of the German attack. It was not an attack upon London, but an attack upon the British Empire. The German General Staff knew well that it was impossible for them to invade Great Britain, and that their only hope lay in the disruption of the Empire. They realised that they could never conquer the British Isles — but they believed that they might conquer Canada and Australia, and thus obtain a tremendous advantage. The Germans knew that the British Navy was the only real barrier between themselves and world conquest, and they relied upon the failure of the British Navy to prevent the landing of the German Army. That was the whole secret of the gigantic scheme — the capture of the British Navy. And that was why every man, woman, and child in the British Isles was now engaged in the one duty that lay before them — the duty of assisting in the defence of the British Navy. The time had not yet come for us to realise the enormous sacrifice that was being made by the sailors and soldiers of our race. All that we knew was that the Germans had made a desperate attempt to capture the British Navy — and that they had failed.	1906	1911.7296

The leaf blade is oval or oblong, tapering to a pointed tip, % to 5 inches long, 1 to 3 inches broad, thin, glabrous or pubescent (hairy) on both sides. The margins are smooth or have minute teeth. The veins are prominent. See Figure 32. The Blossom. The flowers are borne in racemes of from 3 to 15 flowers (usually 5 to 7), and are from % to 2 inches across. The flowers are usually larger than those of the apple and the petals are broader, thicker and less hairy on the margins. The outside of the bud is pubescent (hairy) and the calyx drops away after flowering. See Figure 32. The Tree. The trunk is straight and the branches widely spreading.

These spots are not so objectionable as are those of the apple scab, for they are not likely to extend into the flesh. The disease is not serious and is easily controlled by the ordinary fungicides. Leaf Spot. See under the head of Cherry. BACTERIAL DISEASES Bacterial Blight is caused by a bacillus which attacks the blossoms, young shoots, and sometimes the fruit. The blossoms turn brown and wither. The young shoots show water soaked spots which enlarge and often girdle the twig. The fruit may be affected in a similar manner. Spraying the blossoms with a 1 : 2000 or 1: 3000 solution of formalin will kill the germ and is a sure means of control. It is not known to be present in America. BACTERIAL DISEASES 115 Fig. 49.

It is a native of Persia and has been cultivated there from the earliest times. It is a small tree, reaching a height of only 15 to 20 feet, with a trunk rarely exceeding one foot in diameter. The bark is smooth and greenish gray in colour. The leaves are lanceolate in shape, often over a foot long, and have a serrate margin. The flowers, which are borne before the leaves appear, are large and beautiful and vary in colour from white to dark red. The fruit is a drupe, as in the cherry, plum, and apricot, but the stone is flattened and not rounded as in these fruits. The peach is usually classified as a freestone or a cling	1914	1933.2235
""" He observed the natures of men so exactly, "" writes Reynolds, "" that he could imitate them with the most ludicrous exactness ; and so happily was he established in the public opinion in this respect, that what otherwise would have been thought ill breeding and rudeness was considered at his hands as good natured pleasantry. "" "" In the character of Mr. Smith,"" writes one of his contemporaries, "" we have a living proof that a man may, without any intention or desire of offending, be so strikingly a likeness of different persons, and the more laughable peculiarities of their natures, as to make it difficult for people to enjoy the pleasure of his company, without being shocked at the ill breeding of making such a person a subject of ridicule."" 3 1 Sir Joshua Reynolds's Memoirs, p."	1912	1861.2906

Yes, there was the solitary chair, and the table still stood where he had set it; but there were no signs of any one having passed. Well, he had never seen anything so exasperating in his life. After all, it was not to be supposed that a woman who had to do with that man would be very regular. But it was the man who was most to blame. Paul paced up and down the terrace, and in and out among the trees, until a quarter to twelve, and then he went to bed. And when he awoke in the morning he had a vague hope that perhaps his angry resolution would have cooled. But no, it was strengthened. He would go back to England. He had had enough of the place, and of the woman who could treat a man like that. And yet — just before he went down to breakfast, he found himself standing at the window of his room, looking out at the white terrace.	1909	1903.118
"THE BASHFUL BRIDE. ""Why so downcast, my boy?"" asked Jinks. ""I've got a married sister, "" replied Winks mournfully. ""What if you have?"" ""Well, her husband hasu't got any."" The newspaper man had been drinking hard for three days, and was in a bad humour. ""What's the matter with you, anyway?"" asked a friend. ""You ought to be ashamed to mooch around in that condition."" ""Me!"" roared the newspaper man. ""Me ashamed to mooch? I'm the only man in this town that has any right to mooch. I'm the only man in this whole darned country that has anything to mooch from. I give the whole outfit a good send-off in to day's paper — can't pay rent, can't pay grocery bill, can't pay anything. I'm broke, and everybody knows it. Who wants to borrow money from a broke man? Nobody. Who wants to buy a drink from a broke man? Nobody. Don't talk to me about the indignities of mooching. I'Ve got a mooching status. I'm within the pale of mooching respectability. I'M a broke man. My mooching is legitimate. But what about you?"	1911	1929.6244

The basis of this belief is the assumption that the greater part of the tax is paid on property. In fact, however, the distribution of the tax as between income from property and income from personal exertion, shown in the tables on pages 16 and 18, refutes the assumption. The burden is heavier on earned than on unearned income. SCHEDULE D. — Source Vcndor Unspecified. — Individuals.	1907	1962.6167

THE PHOTOGRAPHIC CRAFTSMAN 77 A NEW USE FOR AN OLD LENS A LENS that has served its time as a microscope is now being used as a photographic lens by Mr. J. L. Smith, of New York. The lens was originally made by Ross, of London, for a microscope, and has been fitted into a shutter of the time speed type. The aperture used is — 1, and the speed is about 1-25. The lens has a focal length of 6 inches and an aperture of 1 inch. The negative reproduced herewith is a portrait taken by Mr. Smith with this lens. It was made on a 5 x 7 plate, and has been enlarged to 8 x 10. The reproduction, while not as sharp as it might be, is not bad for an enlargement of this size.

CHAPTER II THE STRATEGY OF THE DARK AGES 1. THE IRISH STRATEGY 2. THE SAXON STRATEGY 3. THE DANISH STRATEGY 4. THE SCOT STRATEGY 5. THE STRATEGY OF THE ROMAN REMAINS 1. THE IRISH STRATEGY The first of the strategics of the Dark Ages was that of the Irish. They were the first people to leave the track of the Romans in the British Isles, and to make their way by rivers and by sea. The Irish strategy was but a short one. Its first phase, that of the raids, occupied less than a hundred years, and its second phase, that of the settlement, occupied less than a hundred years. In its first phase this strategy was directed almost entirely against the West Coast. The invaders landed at the estuaries of the Western rivers — the Dee, the Mersey, the Clwyd, the Tywi, the Usk, the Severn, the Avon, the Dart, the Tamar, the Ex	1912	1916.3016
"This critical spirit is the most constructive force in the world, — the force which has built all the great social institutions and movements of history. It is the spirit of the reformer, and it is a spirit which now, as always, shows itself most characteristically among the young. 2 THE CRITICAL SPIRIT AMONG THE YOUNG The critical spirit, being the spirit of revolt, is, of course, an essentially negative attitude. It is the attitude of the questioner. It is asking, "" Why ? "" and "" Why not ? "" It is sceptical, and scepticism is a form of intellectual revolt. At its best, it refuses to accept any conclusions or any truths, however venerable, which do not commend themselves to the individual's own reason. It is, therefore, in its essence an attitude of independence. But this independence, like all independence, is relative, and it is not infrequently mistaken for an attitude of self-sufficiency. The typical young critic is quite unaware that he is dependent for his conclusions upon the knowledge he has inherited from the past, and upon the reasoning methods which he has learned from his predecessors. He is, therefore, often disposed to look down with contempt upon the older generation, which seems to him to accept blindly the dogmas which he is questioning. And the older generation, with its greater knowledge and experience, is often inclined to regard the young critic as egotistical and self-sufficient."	1908	1901.4181
"These enthusiasms, if they were not stifled, have been growing ever since, and may now be the most important factors in his life. They are not the results of ""study"" in the narrow sense of the word, but they are the results of a natural education. They are the best and most fruitful things in the education of the man who is now a man, and they are the things which are most likely to be missed from the education of the child who is now a child. I have said that a school without a curriculum is a more difficult place to manage than a school with a curriculum, and this is true. But it does not follow that a school without a curriculum is impossible. It is the school in which the children are given the opportunity to help make the curriculum that approaches most closely to the ideal school. In such a school the children are not given the idea that the things they are studying are only to be studied for a time and then to be forgotten. They are not given the idea that the things they are studying are disconnected with their lives. They are not given the idea that the things they are studying are things which the teacher or the parent thinks they ought to know. They are given the idea that the things they are studying are things which they themselves think they ought to know."	1911	1883.8514
"This is important, since it was during the intervals of the campaign that he first came face to face with his beloved Music, that 620 to which he gives the name of poetry. By now he was no longer the quiet student. He had not been long in Scotland ere he received a sabre cut which seriously injured his ear ; it eventually became his '' death wound."" Never a healthy man, he returned to France, where, hearing of the arrest of his master and the death of Francois I., he renounced everything in despair. How he came to be an interpreter of the Muse, how the poet Ronsard began to live and write, is related by himself in these few words : — ""As I was returning from chapel, melancholy and ill humoured, with my eyes bent upon the ground and my ears stopped, because it had rained to my great inconvenience, the Remembering Angel, to beguile my sorrow, led my mind back to my youth !

41 The Annual Report and Balance Sheet of the Redhill Gas Company, Limited, for the year ended the 3 lst December, 1911, show an unappropriated surplus of £1,067 12s. 3d., against £783 14s. lOd. in 1910. The Directors recommend the payment ot a dividend at the rate of 7 percent, per annum (less tax), amounting to £925, leaving a balance of £142 12s. 3d. to carry forward. The report states : — “ The year 1911 has been a very successful one for the Company. The amount of coal consumed was 1,075 tons, as compared with 1,027 tons in 1910, and the quantity of gas sold was 6,313,000 cubic feet, an increase of 1,248,000 cubic feet over that sold in the previous year. The average price obtained last year was 6s. per 1,000 cubic feet, compared with 6s. 4d. in 1910. The Company’s works have been in constant operation, and, although the prices of coal and oil have ruled higher, resulting in an increased cost of production, the profit on the year shows an increase of £318 over that of 1910. In order to meet the increasing demands for gas supply, the Directors are proceeding with the erection of additional retorts.	1907	1901.9491
It is now generally admitted that the colour of the light affects the colour of the objects illuminated, and, as a consequence, also affects the vision. But may it not also affect the nervous system, and thus indirectly the general health? There is some evidence that it does, and the matter deserves to be investigated. Finally, there is the question of the effects of different systems of lighting on the production of fatigue, both visual and general, and on the disposition and efficiency of the worker. This is a very important matter, and one which should be studied by experts in both lighting and hygiene. * * * * * In conclusion I would impress upon you the importance of co-operation between engineers and hygienists in the work of lighting.	1912	1892.5638
( 53 ) Secondly, the tomb stones, which are either long slabs set on edge, or slabs lying horizontally on the ground, or incised grave stones, which bear the cross and other symbols. The former class is illustrated by the ' Pillar stone ' at Kilpeck (Heref.), and the various examples at Penrith (Westm.) and Llantwit Major (Glam.). The latter class is exemplified by a slab at St. Decumans (Som.), another at Llantwit Major (Glam.), and many at Whithorn (Wigtown). The best known of the churchyard crosses is that at Ruthwell (Dumfries). ' This crossed stone, ' says Allen, ' consists of two pieces of sandstone, which were originally one, and formed a pillar stone or monolith. One face has a cross incised, and the other five runes, or early Scandinavian symbols, of Biblical texts. . . . A large casket was found in the church of St. Martin at Cheadle (Staffs.), which is ornamented with four crosses in high relief, fashioned so as to appear to be inserted into a trellis work of interlaced bands. The face between the two upper arms of the cross is filled with a medallion of the Agnus Dei.'	1904	1878.716
"But I feel really almost myself again."" And he added: ""Kiss me, mother, and good night."" She did kiss him, and Paul Barrett, who had been fevered and morose, was now, thanks to the sweet magic of a woman's love, calm, if not quite cheerful. And so the nurse and the doctor found him when both called to see him. ""This is no place for you, Barrett, "" said Dr. Sam. ""You ought to be in the country."" ""And you ought to go there at once, "" said the nurse, who had known the Barretts for years. 224  ""I will, if you will come and take care of me."" ""Not if I know it, "" said the doctor. ""I will send you some medicine, Barrett, and tomorrow I will see what you ought to do."" ""You will find me all right, doctor."" ""Good night, Barrett."" ""Good night."" Then the nurse, who was a kind woman, said: ""And good night, my boy. Take care of that foot."" Paul laughed. ""My foot is all right now, "" he said. ""But I will take care of it in a literal sense, and I am obliged to you for the hint."" ""That man is a fool, "" said Dr. Sam, as they went down the staircase. ""And that fellow is a genius, "" said the nurse. ""He will be a great lawyer if he lives."""	1909	1924.62
"She was so worn out that her nerves were in a state that would have been dangerous and discreditable to a more ordinary woman. But she was not an ordinary woman. It was that which made her suffer so much. She was extraordinarily sensitive, extraordinarily proud, and her feelings were extraordinarily keen. The extra strain of Jim's attack had overthrown all her forces. She could not be calm and brave and wise for ever. When she saw Miss Tate's face, and remembered the scene of a few minutes before, she could not help it. She broke down. She could not help it. She did not make a scene; she did not sob, or wail, or moan. She simply sat still, and the tears came silently, one after the other, and fell on her clenched hands. The sight of those tears was like a blow to Miss Tate. She had been angry at the girl's words; she was angry no longer. She had seen no tears from her since the first day when she had looked so white and dazed. "" Oh, Barbara ! "" She was on her knees before the girl in an instant, her arms round her, her face against her shoulder. "" I will go back to the pension. I will do anything, I will take any place, I will be anything, if you will only love me as you used to."	1913	1930.09
Pp. 59, 6 figs. (Milano: Hoepli.) 2.50 lire. — First of a series of reports from the Italian Army Aeronautical Experimental Station. The report is devoted entirely to the subject of resistance of surfaces in water. A description is given of the experimental apparatus, and the methods employed in making the measurements are discussed at length. The principal part of the report is taken up by the results of the experiments, which are presented in tabular form, with diagrams and curves. The following surfaces were tested: (1) a flat plate, varying in area from 1,300 to 1,900 sq. cm. with a thickness of 1 cm.; (2) a plate of the same thickness, but curved, the larger dimensions of the area varying from 1,300 to 1,900 sq. cm.; (3) a block, 10 cm. high and 20 cm. wide, with a base area of 1,000 sq. cm., varying in length from 10 to 50 cm.;	1912	1901.1842
the flange thickness is constant, the neutral surface will be of constant depth. If the beam is of unequal breadth, the neutral surface will not be of constant depth, but will approach the tension edge more rapidly at the narrower part than at the wider part. Consider now the case of a beam of constant breadth and variable depth. The neutral surface will, of course, be of unequal depth. If it is assumed that for a given depth of neutral surface the stresses above or below it are proportional to their distances from it, and that consequently the stress per square inch at the neutral surface is zero, the equations of the distribution of stress will be as follows : — Let Z = moment of inertia of the area above the neutral surface.	1908	1936.0571
Next to the State Fair Grounds, where the slide of the sheep barn was made. Across the river to Minneapolis, photographing the old Stone Arch Bridge, and the Fort, now the Government Mills. The trip continued to Excelsior, where a view was made of the old Excelsior House, and then to the picturesque village of Wayzata, where the church and the old Wayzata House were photographed. The return trip was made via the Minnehaha Falls, where a view was made of the Falls and also of the famous old Indian maiden, Minnehaha. All these views were made on the 5 x 8 film camera and the slides were made from the 5 x 8 inch negatives. The stereo views were made on a double 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 camera. 1 shall never tire of making stereo views, as I have always been a stereo enthusiast, and to me there is nothing like them in the way of pictures. But I find that the public is as much interested in stereo views as in the ordinary flat ones, and I am obliged to make mostly flat views, as they sell better. The best way to get the stereo habit started is to make a few views of some local objects and take them to a stereo meeting and show them. The first stereopticon 1 had was made by taking an ordinary flat lantern and cutting a piece out of the centre of the front and inserting a piece of plate glass.	1912	1954.4882

The blow had been fatal — she had killed her son. CHAPTER XVII SHE was alone in her study, where she had scarcely left the door since the night of her son's arrest. It was past midnight and the electric light above her shone full upon her. She sat in an armchair, her head thrown back, her hollow eyes fixed upon the ceiling; in a little wicker basket beside her lay the letters, the photographs of the friends — some of them the friends of her youth, the companions of her first illusions — whom she had known how to do without shame, and without pity. The earnest of. her resignation, her farewell to the world she had loved so well, was there in that basket, where she had deposited them one by one with the thoughts that accompanied each of these reminders of a gracious and fleeting youth.	1913	1907.2249
When, therefore, the magician, or medicine man, or old woman, or witch, or who knows what, does things that are out of the natural course of things, he is attributed by the ignorant and credulous with the powers that man has to do things, though they may not be known to him. For the magician himself does not know how he does them. He has lost the original idea of the action as a symbol, and has only the idea of the marvel that is done. The method of magic, according to Wundt, is this : The magician, seeing some object, and believing it to possess certain properties, acts on it in some way, or treats it as a symbol of the person or thing he wishes to affect.	1908	1876.9159

These should be pinched back or headed off when they reach 18 inches in height. This encourages greater root development and makes stronger and better canes the second year. They should be two feet apart in the row the second year. Red raspberry rows should be five feet apart the first year and pinched back to 18 inches. In the spring following, before growth starts, the plants should be thinned to four feet apart in the row. Black caps may be planted three feet or four feet apart the first year in rows six or seven feet apart, but in the spring following, before growth starts, they should be thinned to 1 feet or 2 feet apart in the row. 5 CHAPTER III. CARING FOR THE OLD PLANTING. CULTIVATION. The rows should be kept level to save moisture and for convenience in harvesting. A horse cultivator should be used on level rows and should be ridden or driven close to the bushes. The one horse plough should not be used on the question of level rows. Shallow cultivation of the entire surface is very important. The soil should be stirred frequently and kept loose, especially in dry weather. Wornout, run out land is more quickly rejuvenated if it is cropped and then planted to berries. Two or three ploughings, followed by a good harrowing, will level and loosen up such land and make it much less likely to soak and bake.	1914	1980.265
"It is this that secures the respect for the People's Forum which the regular political forum has not been able to maintain. No political debate can long have the interest and the tension of an election contest; and in a state like Minnesota, where the proportion of voters to population is large, the excitement of a campaign cannot be maintained. But a single question is sufficient for a great deal of discussion, and the forums multiply. When the whole state was ablaze with the excitement of the prohibition question, the campaign was in full swing. But, though the issue is no longer upon the ballot, it still persists in the People's Forum. Minnesota is not unique in this enlarging of the idea of a ""forum."" In Massachusetts the term is applied to an association of students and citizens, meeting regularly for debate, and there are many such organisations. But Minnesota is unique in its People's Forum, for here it is not a single organisation; it is a network of organisations in which each local organisation is independent and has its own programmes and methods. It corresponds to the Minnesota idea of democracy. 4. Importance of the People's Forum The People's Forum is, as one speaker put it, ""the most important and the least important thing that has ever happened in Minnesota."" It is important in that it is the means by which the people are learning to discuss the great questions of state and nation independently, as they ought."	1911	1904.2538
But she was not quite without resources. She had a little gold locket, which contained the likenesses of her father and mother, and which had been given to her by her father on the day of her marriage; and she had also a little gold ring, which had been given to her by her mother on the day of her father's marriage. These two trinkets she had worn on her person, and they were all that she possessed in the world. She took them off and gave them to her sister-in-law, who promised to go to the pawnshop and get the money on them, and to send the money to her by the first post. And when the old lady had gone, she went upstairs to her own room, and sat down on the side of her bed, and looked around her, and looked at her hands, and looked at her feet, and looked at her clothes, and looked again at her hands and her feet and her clothes, that she might be sure that she was not dreaming, and that she really was the same Mrs. Houghton that had been Mrs. Houghton yesterday. And she was. And she was also the same Mrs. Houghton that had been Mrs. Houghton yesterday, in that she was a little sick, and a little pale, and a little frightened, and a little dazed, and a little bewildered, and a little desolate, and a little heartbroken, and a little crushed, and a little ashamed, and a little humiliated, and a little ashamed, and a little humiliated, and a little heartbroken, and a little crushed, and a little desolate, and a little bewildered, and a little dazed, and a little pale, and	1908	1896.647
"A few English soldiers were still to be seen, but they were mostly wounded and being conveyed in ambulances to the hospitals in the south. The German officers, of course, were very inquisitive, but they were kept in ignorance. The only thing that puzzled them was the apparent lack of interest displayed by the Londoners. The shops were open, and business was carried on as usual. In fact, many men were making a good deal of money out of the misfortune that had befallen the country. Everything was very dear, and the shops were doing a roaring trade. In them, however, no German goods were to be found. All had been sold. The only stock in trade was of English manufacture, and that was at famine prices. All day long the German officers were engaged in making inquiries of the inhabitants, but they could glean nothing. There was a spirit of defiance in the heart of every Englishman. They were convinced that the Germans would never hold the capital, and that the tide of war would soon sweep them back across the Channel. The day after the landing, the Germans were astounded to read in the Standard, which had appeared in a somewhat mutilated condition, a proclamation from the lips of the Field marshal, in which he declared his intention of holding an Inquiry into the causes of the military disaster, and of punishing severely all those who were responsible. The proclamation concluded with the words — ""We shall never surrender."" 16 IN THE GERMAN HEADQUARTERS "" MY dear Arthur, this is splendid!"" exclaimed Frank, springing on to a chair and waving his hand in triumph. "" We shan't have to wait long for the Germans to be kicked out of England."	1906	1893.1708
Its main defect is that it is individual, not collective, psychology, and that it is concerned with the exceptional rather than the average man. But the study of the exceptional has its value, and to the novelist, at any rate, the exceptional and the average man are not wholly unlike. It has been observed that the novel of adventure has in recent years passed into a period of decadence. The explanation is not far to seek. Adventure is a function of the exceptional, and to us the exceptional man is the hero of romance rather than of real life. The life of the average man is a life of routine, and the interest of routine is the interest of the average man. The most important function of the novel to day is the analysis of the routine in the life of the average man. The chapter of the average man. The chapter of the average man.

When the Federal Government is willing to spend such vast sums for the development of a territory, the people of the territory naturally feel that they are being discriminated against, and that they should be allowed to manage their own affairs in common with other people of the United States. The Salt River project, which was the fust irrigation project taken up by the Reclamation Service, is now nearing completion. The Roosevelt Dam, which is the chief feature, has been completed since 1911. It is a masonry structure about a mile and a half long and nearly one hundred feet high. The lake formed by the dam has been named Lake Roosevelt. It is about twenty miles long and about four miles wide at its widest part. It has a storage capacity of more than three hundred million million gallons of water.	1911	1923.7349
"You never knew what it was to love a child — a live child of your own. You had the mind of a man, and the heart of a politician — nothing else! "" Lady Coryston rose. ""I will say no more to you — "" ""No, you don't want to hear any more! You have made up your mind that I am going to quit England for you — that, by dying, and leaving my children penniless, I am going to save you and your precious party from seeing a Corry in the House ofCommons! You are wrong! We owe nothing to you — nothing! And we do not propose to be sacrificed to your whims and your pride, for all that you are a socialist's daughter."	1913	1893.5662

The meadow is now a pleasant public park, and the only reminder of those days of horror is a fountain built in the centre of the old quemadero, or crematory. The Inquisition was not a Spanish institution; it had been in existence in Italy for some time, but not until the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella did it become a part of the Spanish dominion. It was not a religious institution; it was purely a political institution, the greatest weapon of statecraft that ever was forged, and in its wielding the Catholic sovereigns showed themselves past masters. The power of the Inquisition was absolute; it was independent of the civil law; its jurisdiction extended over all classes and conditions of men; it was indifferent to sex, age, or disease.	1913	1906.1683
BAGGED GRAPES. — THE BAGS ARE LIFTED OVER THE BUNCH AND FASTENED WITH A PIN. Photo by M. O. Pool. — Horticulturist. — 24 028. Horse manure is most excellent for fertilizing grapes, yet it is not very convenient for the purpose, and if the vineyard is small it entails too much work to be hauled out and spread. However, it may be used to advantage in the hill culture system, where it may be placed on the hills as mulch. Stable litter may be worked into the soil as a mulch between the rows of a vineyard; and if the vineyard is ploughed, it may be put in at the same time with the plough and covered over, or it may be spread on the surface, either in the fall or in the spring, before the ploughing begins.	1914	1926.3844
each would cost £495. The total for fittings and wiring would be £825. The cost of the cable would be small. The power required would be 198 x 4 = 792 watts, say 1 kilowatt. The cost of the current for lighting half a mile of street would be about 12s. a week. The cost of the installation would be about £1,000. There would be very little maintenance, and the cost of the current would be very small. The installation would be very suitable for a small town. The number of lamps could be increased and the power required for each lamp reduced, if necessary. Electric Street Cars. — In the case of electric street cars, the cost of the current is a very small item compared with the cost of the car, and the maintenance of the conductors and the cost of the current are the only items which need be considered. The conductors are usually made of 7 strands of copper wire, in sizes varying from No. 7 to No. 4, according to the run of the wire. The total length of the conductors is about 1| times the length of the line. For a line of 1 mile the total length of the conductors would be about 8,500 feet. We will take No. 7 wire, which weighs 7 lbs. per 100 feet, therefore 8,500 feet would weigh 595 lbs. at £70 a ton, the cost would be £20.	1912	1945.1682
However, the numerical value for Z4 is obtained from the following consideration : — 1 he rudder is inclined at an angle of 20° to the vertical, on the average — see Fig. 54, and this angle is got from rough estimates involving its size and position the angle of yaw being small and its changes very small during a turn. Now, giving the machine a velocity of 45 ft. per sec. in a clockwise direction, it is easy to calculate, from the mean radius of turn, the angular velocity of the machine about its vertical axis, and hence the corresponding velocity of the air. This might be represented as an angular velocity of 45 A J2 ft. ped sec. about a vertical axis at the centre of the turn, or as an angular retardation of — ^ yr ft. persec.d where r. a mean radius of turn. The effect of this angular velocity on the rudder is an apparent wind from the left, below the line of flight, and from the right above, of magnitude ^^ ^ ft. persec.	1912	1903.1885
"he yelled. "" Get him, you fool, before he has a chance!"" Then the sword rasped again; there was a passing pinch of pain on Von Marx' forearm, and the pressure of the hand relaxed. He shoved his disengaged hand forward, and the muzzle of the revolver was against his forehead. It moved away an inch, and the hand that held it dropped to the level of the breast. There was a second sob of metal on metal, and the two men faced each other, no more than a foot apart. So far as Von Marx could see, the two men were one and the same. The same hard, desperate face, the same figure clad in black, the same drawn, white hand that gripped a swordjonly the sword was lowered now, as if the man who held it no longer felt in need of striking.

It is a pernicious practice for a college to admit anyone to its faculty who is not a product of the best possible graduate school and who has not under the best possible conditions shaped himself as a scholar, and it is equally a pernicious practice for a school to admit to the teaching force persons who have not devoted themselves most earnestly to the acquirement of the technique of teaching, and who have not thoroughly studied the present needs and tendencies of the school system. There is no need of classifying here the mathematical studies and their arrangement in order of growing importance. We are considering only the place of the new knowledge. It is obviously impossible for the school to do this, and for that reason it is the duty of the college to provide facilities for such advanced knowledge in the mathematical field as will enable the candidate for teaching to satisfy himself as to the claims of the new knowledge, and to learn its needs and possibilities.	1909	1893.3414

When the Sherman Law was passed, most of the older states had, for some years, had anti trust laws of their own. It was, therefore, natural that, in the organisation of the Federal Government, the duty of enforcing the Sherman Law should be placed upon the Department of Justice, rather than a Bureau of Commerce and Labour. With Canada the case is different. In her Combines Investigation Act she has followed the lead of our Bureau of Commerce and Labour; and we have now come to the time when, for both countries, the Commission form of remedying the abuses of monopoly is the favourite remedy. The Commission form is superior to the prosecution form, for both countries, because the prosecution form, by its very nature, permits only of a trial and a conviction, with a consequent heavy fine, as a penalty for monopoly.	1911	1898.788
This was the position of the only remaining body of the London Volunteers at that moment not accounted for, and we had every reason to believe that they were still in there, and might prove a source of very serious trouble. Consequently, at daybreak the whole of the troops available for active service were called out, and we surrounded the island on its land side, while, on the other, the warships and armoured cruisers kept up an incessant bombardment. The effect of this fire was wonderful. It was at once apparent that the Volunteers could not possibly stand it, and a prompt surrender was hopeless. Even the obstinacy of Tochatti could not survive a fire like that. Directly a way was cleared through the trees by means of volley firing from the infantry, a somewhat ragged but still formidable column came surging out, its head under the protection of a screen of skirmishers, and its tail guarded by a couple of field guns and some Maxims.	1906	1876.4327
"It holds that the use of the ' ceremonial ' vestments in no way impairs the validity of the sacrament. Moreover, the report asserts that ' the intention of the Church of England has always been that the Holy Eucharist is to be celebrated and solemnised in the Church of England according to the use of the Church of England.' "" The "" Morning Leader"" says : — "" It must be remembered that the report is not unanimous, and that the minority, which includes some of the most eminent among the signatories, has grave objections to the conclusions reached by the majority. It is, however, a report which, in the opinion of its authors, should be of the greatest assistance to the Government and to the Church in the task of revising the law of ritual."	1907	1892.6078
In our Earth the torrid zone, or belt of perpetual summer, stretches from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn (see Appendix). The Frigid zone, or belt of perpetual winter, stretches from the Arctic Circle to the North Pole, and the Antartic Circle to the South Pole. The Temperate zones are the intermediate belts of mixed summer and winter, between the torrid and frigid zones. On Mars the torrid zone comprises the latitude belt from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn, the Frigid zones stretch from the Arctic Circle to the North Pole, and the Antartic Circle to the South Pole, while the Temperate zones are the intermediate latitude belts between the torrid and frigid zones. The axial inclination is 23° 12' as compared with 23° 27' on the Earth, and hence the seasons would appear to possess the same characters, but last a little longer on Mars. The slight difference is due to the fact that, while the axial inclination remains almost constant, the plane of the orbit revolves around the axis of the planet with a period of about 23010 years. The plane of the present orbit was coincident with the equator of the planet, 12000 years ago, so that the current seasons would appear slightly more severe on Mars than on the Earth. But the periods of the seasons have a ratio of 686 to 365, and the length of the Martian year is 1.8 times that of our Earth, so that the long and short days and nights, and the long and short winters and summers, must have a proportionate length. Applying this rule, the Martian winter must last 1.8 times as long as the corresponding winter on Earth, and the summer must last only five sixths as long	1913	1961.9388
"In the foreground is one of the ox wagons still in use in western Nebraska by the ranchmen. A stereoscopic camera, as the word implies, is a camera with two lenses, so placed that the distance between them is about the same as the distance between the eyes of an average person. In fact, the lenses are said to be placed on a ""stereoscopic base."" The accompanying illustration shows just how the lenses are placed, while the dotted lines indicate the opening through which the picture is taken. It is necessary that everything be just as shown in this illustration in order to make a perfect stereoscopic picture. The setting of the adjustments is very simple. The Sensitive Plate Holder, or Slide, is made to slide backward and forward, so that it can be placed exactly at the distance from the lenses that the object to be photographed is from the camera."	1912	1968.1781
"Then the quarry is abandoned and a new one opened. This method is very wasteful, as it allows the weathering action to break up the more or less exposed sheets of mica, and permits the wind and rain to wash away much of the smaller material. The method is well adapted for the so-called "" pegmatite "" or "" sheet "" deposits, where the mica occurs in large, flat sheets, which can be easily pried out, and where the sheet is so large that the weathering action does not break it into several smaller pieces. The quarry is usually from 10 to 20 feet wide and of an indefinite length, and from 2 to 6 feet deep. The walls are usually inclined from the face to the back, or to the sides, so as to prevent the falling of loose material upon the miners."	1905	1905.7325

The chief exception is that, in order for this process to work, there must be a warm upper air current to provide the warm humid air. This is what happens in the formation of the warm front type of overcast — Section 3. a. There is a warm moist air mass impinging upon a cool air mass and, in the collision process, the warm air slides up over and cools the lower layers to saturation. The air in contact with the cold surface cools the most and hence the lower layers of the overcast are usually more stable than the layers aloft and the overcast usually dissipates upward. A second method of causing fog to form over water is by the injection of moisture into the lower layers of the atmosphere from a sea or lake.	1913	1983.7826
"It is well to know, however, that the principles were enunciated and the practice adopted in ancient Greece and Rome. The best physicians in those days were great travellers, and it was to them that the world was indebted for the first well-defined knowledge of the various effects of climate and soils upon man. The schools of Hippocrates and Galen taught the necessity of the physician being a natural philosopher, a botanist, an astronomer. The patient, it was maintained, should be carefully studied in all his moods and phases. Ancient medicine knew nothing of the smattering which so many men mistake for learning. The best physicians of those days were well versed in mathematics and geometry. Aristotle has said, ""The human soul can know only what it has learned, therefore it is only through the senses that the soul can acquire knowledge."""	1911	1892.7003
105  Planting is done preferably in March and April, and may be done as late as the first of June in the North. The better way is to plant in the beds in which the berries are to be grown. As with so many other plants, the success of planting the cranberry depends on the proper preparation of the seed bed. The bed should be level and may be prepared with a spade or with a plow, but not to a depth of more than two or three inches. In preparing it the object sought is to loosen the soil without making it too deep. The planting is done in straight rows, the cuttings being set about a foot apart in the row and the rows about a foot FIG. 13.	1914	1894.3533
On the west they are higher and more rugged, and have a more forbidding look. The hills are crowned with the remains of the ancient forest, which is still the pride of the town. The Panmure and other rivers are fed from the hills. The Panmure rises in a swampy flat about two miles from the town, and after a winding course of about seven miles enters the sea a mile and a half to the south of the town. The Buffalo rises in a swampy flat about a mile and a half from the sea, and enters the sea about three-quarters of a mile to the north of the town. The old Dutch names of the rivers have been changed to those of British generals. The town was founded in 1849 by the British Kaffrarian Company, and was originally called Fort Glamorgan. It was a military post, and its occupation was intended to protect the native chief, Sandilli, from the attacks of the Cape Colony. The fort was garrisoned by the 73rd Highlanders, under Colonel Somerset, and was commanded by Captain Campbell. The post was deserted in 1853, and the place was not resettled until 1857, when it was renamed East London. It was made a port of entry in 1866, and a municipality in 1873. It is now a town of over 12,000 inhabitants, and is the chief port of the eastern border. The chief buildings are the Town Hall, the Post Office, and the Court House, which are all in close proximity to each other.	1908	1895.3505
The total area of a station is, of course, fixed, but the number of passengers using it is most variable, and consequently the number of lamps that are required to give good illumination varies also. Many stations are lighted by means of fixed lamps and portable lamps, the latter being brought out for use when the number of passengers is large. When the number of passengers is small, only the fixed lamps are in use, and as these are generally arranged in rows, the lamps farthest from the entrance are often in darkness. The result is that the first impression of a station on entering is that it is badly lighted, and this impression is increased by the fact that the lamps burning are usually above the line of vision, and as the eye of the observer adapts itself to the brilliant illumination of the lamps, the darker parts, which are usually at a greater distance, do not appear bright enough.	1912	1879.8649
"T. The question, Do we make the best of it? has several answers. Weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth are not good for the child, and these we give it. We do not give it the warmth of a home, the comfort of a mother's love, the solace of a father's protection, the companionship of brothers and sisters. The life we offer it is one of isolation and neglect, from which weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth are the only escape. We provide it with a roof over its head, but we do not trouble to make that roof a home. We give it a name, but it is a name which marks it out as an outcast. We give it food and clothing, but grudgingly, and not in such manner that it will grow into a healthy man or woman. We take it into the workhouse, but only when it is sick; and into the casual ward, but only when death stares it in the face. We take it into the Industrial School, but charge ourselves with the maintenance there of only until it is twelve years old, when we cast it back on the world, a boy or girl, homeless and friendless, to find its way as best it can. We take it into the Reformatory School, but only when it is already a criminal in the eyes of the law, and the State is forced to take notice of it. We take it into the Poor Law School, but only because it is the "" illegitimate child of the pauper, "" and the law forces the guardians to receive it. We take it into the Foundling Hospital, but only because the mother herself is a Foundling. We do nothing to make the best of the business."	1911	1904.6599
"This not only stops development but retards it, so that I can time my prints more accurately. After this stop bath the prints are placed in the fixing bath, which consists of: Ammonium thiosulphate 2 ozs. Water 32 "" This bath is changed frequently, so that it will always be kept strong, and I fix until the print is entirely cleared, which takes from ten to twenty minutes. After fixing the prints are washed in running water for an hour. I do not use a toning bath, as I like the prints in their natural colour. After washing the prints are dried face down on a piece of plate glass, which gives them a surface like that of the original paper. In finishing my prints I use a very simple method. I have a small print frame, made to my order, which holds the print tight against the glass, and into this frame I place a piece of plate glass, which is not over one-sixteenth of an inch thicker than the print. Over this glass I place a piece of cardboard, and over this a piece of blotting paper. The whole is then placed under a weight of about fifty pounds. Now, in regard to the exposure of the paper. I have found that it is quite a common practice to expose the paper for only one or two seconds in the camera, and then to develop the print for as long a time as is necessary to bring it up to a high point of brightness."	1912	1915.036
instead of being a mere accessory, is the chief element in the play; and this explains the fact that the speeches of the actors are often thrown away in the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in 1808 (T. Rowlandson) 45 representation of Racine's works, as the dramatic action is a mere sham, and has no relation to the words. The result is that the English actor's art consists in the perfect imitation of the passions which are supposed to be felt by the person he represents, and in the skilful and appropriate expression of their outward manifestation. It is this that makes the English actor so much more interesting than the French; and it is not till we adopt the same system of dramatic art that we shall be able to produce actors of the same high merit.	1912	1867.458
I withdrew. The sacred relics are shown once a year in the month of Ramadan. They include a strand of the Prophet's beard, a tooth, some of his hair, a footprint, his sword, and the standard he carried in battle. The standard is of green silk, and the sword of pure gold. The footprint is in a slab of stone, and is said to be an impression made by the Prophet on the rock of Mount Sinai. The relics are kept in a room on the right of the interior, and the door is ceremonially opened only for the exhibition. The court is surrounded by a colonnade, the pillars of which are of ancient marble, and the roof is supported by beams of cedarwood, carved and painted in brilliant colours.	1913	1891.2218
"CHAPTER VI AMONG THE MOUNTAINS ""And it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and all nations shall flow unto it."" — Micah iv. 1.  1  AMONG THE MOUNTAINS  I HAVE read somewhere that the oldest of the Indian tribes of America, the Dacotahs, believe that the mountains have ears, and that they are sacred to the Great Spirit. But whether this is true or not, I cannot say. It is true, however, that all nations and peoples, from the earliest times, have looked upon the mountains as sacred. They have been the home of the gods. Islam, Zoroastrianism and Judaism have each in turn worshipped at the mountain shrine of Sinai."	1908	1870.8407
But in order to secure the best results in such work, it is essential to have a good flashlight outfit. By a good outfit we mean one that will give a bright, white light and one that will not smoke. The light should be bright enough to eliminate all shadows and to give a sharp picture, and it should be white enough to reproduce the natural colours of the sitter's complexion. The outfit should also be one that will not smoke, for with a smoky light, the background is sure to be disfigured with ugly stains; white clothes will be made dingy and even skin itself will take on a dirty hue. In this issue we are publishing a little article which explains fully how to make a flashlight without smoke.	1912	1943.3188
Tail long and slender, the terminal nail consisting of a long, pointed blackish spear. Head and body about twenty-two inches; tail twenty-one inches. This beautiful species is restricted to Western Queensland. The rock Wallabies are all included in the genus Petrogale. Their form is robust and their limbs well developed. The colour pattern of the fur is very variable. The three species most familiar to us are the following. The scrub rock wallaby. Petrogale penicillata. This is the largest of our rock wallabies. Above brownish grey, the fur with black bands; below greyish white; a broad white stripe on the side of the head and neck, and a similar hip stripe.

"""I know what you mean, but there are others here who think the same way. I wiU have the camera boxed up and sent to you, and, what's more, I will guarantee it to be the best camera you have ever owned."" ""On your own responsibility?"" I asked. ""Certainly. If it's not everything I say, send it back and I wiU refund your money."" I was introduced to that little camera the next day. It was a pretty thing, with a mahogany finish on its case. It was fitted with a Zeiss tessar lens, the shutter being a compound. Above the lens was a brilliant finder. The bellows were covered with the best leather, and the controls were simple. A slight bulge on the top of the case showed where the bulb attachment was made to the inside of the lens. The shutter was a little slow, but I could tolerate that. I would speed it up with a drop of oil. I had been assured that it was a screamer. ""Well, my friend, you have sold me today, "" I said to the demonstrator. ""It looks like a million dollars. The only thing I hope is that it will act like one."" ""See here, "" he said, as he got out a box of plates and some developing materials, ""I'll go you halves on this."	1912	1980.3458
"Her work at the Institute was never remarkable, but the possibility of her doing better somewhere else was always held out to her. Barrett realised that she would never be able to take the step backward that was necessary before she could advance to the next step in her studies, and his knowledge of the conservatism of the Institute was such that he felt sure that his pupil could never do more than remain a beginner there. ""Alma,"" he said one day, ""there are two or three excellent conditions for a student in a school I know of, and those conditions are made for just such a spirit in art as yours; shall I see whether they can be yours?"" ""Why, yes!"" she said, ""if you think it worthwhile."" ""I assure you I do!"" he smiled, delightedly."	1913	1913.3588
Hairs of tail short. Feet and tail above dark brownish grey, below pale yellowish white. Fur of back greyish, darker on the head. Face and limbs brownish grey. Throat and underparts yellowish white, the former with a dark stripe down the middle. Tail naked below for about three inches, its tip blackish.

And if England should not be found worthy of her past, if she should not be found to be willing to help her children at all costs, then, my brothers, it will not be the fault of the younger men of India, if in their passion for liberty, and in their desire for ordered freedom, they listen to those who will encourage them in the mistaken belief that the English are not their friends. If, because of the selfishness of the few, the many are to suffer, then, my brothers, the younger men of India will be driven to the realisation that they cannot depend upon those who in the moment of crisis are not prepared to sacrifice their selfish interests to the general welfare. 108  And you may be sure that the younger men of India will follow the example set to them by the older ones.	1914	1889.7621
The mining of mica is a laborious process, as the sheets are quite brittle and break easily. The workers are therefore compelled to pick out the sheets, after the vein material has been taken out, and then to extract them from the walls of their pocket mines, using chisels, screw drivers and similar tools for this purpose. All the mines are operated in this way, as the Indian workman, like his white brother, is unwilling to take any unnecessary trouble in mining. After being taken from the pocket, the sheets are packed in bags and boxes and shipped to the mill or factory. The packing is done with great care, as the breakage of the mica incident to this stage of production is considerable. At present, all the mica mined is packed in bales and boxes and sent to the mill at Charlotte. There the mica is graded and prepared for the market. USES OF MICA. Mica over the country is used for a variety of purposes. In the mineralogic and technological literature many of these uses are mentioned. The greatest use for the natural product is as a dielectric. In this connection it is used in the manufacture of condenser and insulating plates for telephones, dynamos, electric bells, etc. Mica is also used to a considerable extent in the manufacture of the insulator plug, which is so widely used in the cotton mills of the country.	1905	1902.6674
As a matter of fact, this system of indirect lighting is not only the most pleasing from an artistic standpoint, but it is, as a rule, the most efficient, the most economical, and the most satisfactory system that can be devised. It is the most sanitary. The fixtures can be kept clean with very little trouble. They are as a rule higher up on the wall, and are out of the way of dust, and, as a rule, the reflectors are easily cleaned. It is the most comfortable. There are no direct rays of light to be seen, and no shadows or glare. It is the most efficient. The lamps are high up on the wall, and the light is reflected down into the room. The average loss in efficiency with a well designed indirect fixture is about 35 percent. This is much less than with any other system of lighting. It is the most artistic. With a little care in the selection of the fixtures, and the arrangement of the lamps, the best artistic efiect can be obtained. It is the most economical. The average cost of the installation is less than with any other system. The average cost of operation is less than with any other system. The average depreciation is less than with any other system. There are no shadows, glare, or hot spots. It is the most satisfactory. The average life of the lamps is much longer than with any other system.	1912	1882.8815
The enemy have been doing some heavy bombardment. These Germans are as good as their word, and a good deal better, for they threaten a great deal that they do not carry out, but when once they have made up their minds to do a thing, they do it thoroughly. It was about one o'clock that the sound of the guns began to be very distinct, and the shells began falling in our immediate vicinity. The noise of the explosion of the shells is not very loud, but it is very peculiar and very un like anything else. It is not a bang at all. It is a sort of prolonged sigh, like the noise made by the rush of the steam from a safety valve. It is a sound which is very soon recognised. At first, it was not very numerous, and I had just gone into lunch when it began to increase very much, and to be accompanied by a good deal of rifle fire. From the window of the dining room I could see the distant towers of the City, and, to my astonishment, they were all veiled in a thin shroud of light grey smoke, which grew more and more dense, and soon hid everything. The bombardment was evidently very severe, and the enemy's artillery and rifle fire were making a great deal of noise. I went back into the office and saw the first report of the German General Staff, which was, as usual, couched in the most offensive terms.	1906	1874.4574
"And he went away looking so glad!"" ""And you were glad too, "" said the girl. "" Oh, yes, perhaps now I could marry him!"" There was a moment's silence. Then Miss Glenwilliam pushed back her chair. ""I must go, "" she said. "" I must get some breakfast — and I must — no, I can't say good-bye to you, "" she added, holding out her hand. ""I can't believe it! And yet — it is true, "" she said, looking round the room. ""I shall have to get used to it — so must you."" ""We shall meet again, "" said the girl. ""Will we?"" asked the other. "" Yes, I think we shall — in the spring, "" said Miss Glenwilliam, speaking slowly. "" And I shall look for you, "" she said, suddenly. "" Oh, I shall look for you! — I shall want you!"" ""And I shall want you!"" said the girl. "" I shall come back."" ""Yes — do come back, "" said Miss Glenwilliam, in a low voice. And they parted. ""I must go, "" she said again, at the door, and the other girl smiled. ""You must go, "" she repeated, with a sort of wistful wonder in her eyes. ""Yes,"" she said, slowly, ""it seems so strange — you and I, always parting — always meeting again — and now — yes, you must go."""	1913	1923.1099
The fluorescent tube is very well adapted for use with a low ceiling. It is also well adapted for use with a sloping ceiling, as shown at A in Fig. 4. It is not necessary to use a reflector with this type of lamp, but if a perforated reflector (B in Fig. 4) is used, it is better not to space the tubes too far apart, as the back illumination from the reflector is not very pleasing. The incandescent electric lamp is, of course, very well suited for a ■^i lower ceiling. Fluorescent lamps are also well suited for use with intermediate heights of ceiling, as shown at B in Fig. 3. In this case it is quite necessary to use a reflector, and the type shown at A in Fig. 3 is as good as any. The incandescent electric lamp is, of course, also suited for an intermediate height of ceiling. The high ceiling, illustrated in Fig. 2, requires special treatment. The incandescent electric lamp in this case is generally placed in pairs, so that an intermediate plane of light is produced. The lamps are also so placed with reference to the position of the work that the direction of the light is mainly downwards. As a rule, it is best not to have a central glass ventilator and a circular row of lamps round it, as suggested in the upper figure of the left column in Fig. 2, for this arrangement leads to a very bad shadow of the work.	1912	1913.872
The idea of the transitory character of the self was suggested by the phenomena of the physical world, and became a leading article of his metaphysical creed. To him the world of the senses was not a mere veil hiding a spiritual reality, but a reality in itself. The unchanging was not the relative opposite of the changing, but the changing was the manifestation of the unchanging. It was not a background, but the picture itself. It was not a mere appearance, but the true nature of things. The self was a phenomenon in the world of phenomena, and possessed no existence outside of its manifestations. When the last of these had disappeared, the self, like the world of phenomena, would be seen to have no independent existence, and would pass into the condition of latent being, ready to reappear in a new manifestation when the time was ripe.	1913	1887.9303
"""Yes, that is it, Paul, "" the lady answered, laughing. ""It is not a great poem, but it is a sincere one, written very quickly, and I have never revised it."" ""You must give it me to keep, "" he repeated, ""and I shall keep it very carefully, because it is the first of your poems that I ever read."" "" What !

""I shall never forget that, Paul."" ""Then I shall never have your Cleopatra poem."" ""Yes, you shall."" ""But I have never read the rose poem."" ""I shall send it you, then, "" she said, laughing. ""It is a very silly poem, and I am ashamed of it."" ""Then I shall never read the rose poem. I want to hear you say that it is a very beautiful poem, that you love it, that you are proud of it."" ""You are very selfish, Paul."""	1909	1897.7416
It was a fact that the two great systems of lighting were now working in harmony. The two societies, the Institution of Gas Engineers and the Society of Electrical Engineers, had been brought together in a very remarkable manner. Each had their separate individual interests to look after, but the interests of the public came first, and it was now recognised that the two systems of lighting could work together in the greatest harmony. He was glad to see that both the electrical and gas engineers were coming together, and he sincerely trusted that the time was not far distant when the two systems of lighting would be united in one great engineering society, where they would meet together, and, whilst looking after the interests of the public, also look after their own interests.	1912	1904.8495
"Effeminacy is not the male form of femininity. It is a form of degeneration, a negation of masculinity, and its cause is generally to be found in the excessive development in the man of feminine characteristics; or, if you like, in the excessive neglect of 216 February 1"", 1912 THE FREEWOMAN money out of discord, unity out of multiplicity. The more discrepant and complex the factors of endowment, the higher presumably the potentialities of the personality; but also — here is my point — the greater the danger of failure. And failure in this task involves nothing less than the collapse and disintegration of the personality. Mr. Birnstingl assumes that what I call effeminacy in a man differs only in degree from what I call femininity. But that is not so. Effeminacy is not the male form of femininity. It is a form of degeneration, a negation of masculinity, and its cause is generally to be found in the excessive development in the man of feminine characteristics; or, if you like, in the excessive neglect of 216 feminine characteristics in the man, or, again, in both causes combined. The argument is perfectly simple and perfectly sound, and it leaves no room for the effeminate man in the New World."	1911	1922.6293
"I want my big sister Solly."" Jim hesitated. He thought, "" She can't be much of a big sister if she doesn't come home till eleven o'clock."" But he did not say this. He merely went back to his room. Ten minutes after, Molly opened Content's door, and, going in, sat down on the edge of the bed. "" It'S all right, dear, "" she said, "" about sister Solly. I came down on a car with her, and she went to Mrs. Keith's, where she is going to stay."" "" Will she come back to us, "" asked Content. ""I don't know, sweet, "" said Molly, doubtfully, "" whether she wants to or not. I hope so."" Content put her arms around her mother's neck. "" I don't want anybody but you, "" she said. It was nearly eleven and the children were all in bed when Molly came downstairs. "" Well, "" said Jim, "" did you ever come home from a party on a car before? It took you a good hour."" "" I'M sorry to be late, "" said Molly. "" I had some trouble with my baggage — and then I didn'T feel like rushing away from my friends."" ""You didn'T feel like rushing away from your sister Solly, "" said Jim."	1913	1922.4237
"The contest was carried on to the end in an excellent spirit, in sharp contrast to the bitter strife which marked Sibley's fight in 1908. All the candidates pledged themselves to support the nominee, whoever he might be. There was no scattering vote at the election, and Brumbaugh won by more than 50,000 votes. 1 Washington Post. "" But all my savings, all my scrimping and saving the children are due to the accumulations of many years past. I haven't given them a cent since I went out of office that I know of, and I think I ought to have the reward of my service, and I'm going to have it."" This was the sentiment which animated a large number of the old guard of machine Republicans, when the recent primaries in Pennsylvania were approaching."	1911	1923.7559
The following table shows at a glance the relation existing between the different stop numbers of the American and the German (D) systems: U. S 1 1.4 1.8 2 2.8 4 8 11 16 22 32 45 64 90 128 180 256 D 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.4 1.6 2 2.8 4 5.6 8 11 16 22 32 These numbers are based upon a plan of numbering the stops, which is that of all systems that have followed any rational plan, of opening the lens one half or doubling the area of the opening for each successive number in the series. This is, in fact, the law of light distribution, as already explained. In practice, however, on account of the varying shapes and sizes of stops, as the number of divisions in the circle of the iris is fixed, it is impossible to adhere absolutely to this law. Hence, instead of following the plan of doubling the area for each number, it is customary to make the stops increase in size for each number according to the law of the square root of the numbers, which gives the following results: If the diameter of No. 1 be called 100, then for U. S. system D system No. 2 113.5 112 No. 3 127.3 126 No. 4 141.4 142 No. 5 158.5 158 No. 6 177.2 173 No. 7 196.4 189 No. 8 216.4 206 No. 9 237.2 223 No. 10 258.9 240 No. 11 281	1912	1952.4166

"The work of the true artist is to seize the moment when the revelation of beauty is most vivid, and in this sense the night photographer is no exception. The difficulty is to find that moment, for the changing effects of light and shade are of short duration, and unless one is prepared to wait for some time, or to visit the same spot on many occasions, the chance is a poor one. The plate will not permit the long exposure necessary to record the transient beauty of the moonlit scene, while the density of the shadows precludes the rendering of the brilliant lights which are the chief attraction of city life at night. ""Nevertheless, there are many picturesque possibilities in night photography, and if the endless labour of making the exposure and waiting for the development be not too irksome, the results may be worth while."""	1912	1881.0746
