Anachronism labeling notes and guide. Begun by Matt on 1/11/25.

## Guidelines

**[Updated 1/21/25]** There are two criteria that a model generation must satisfy to be judged "ok"/"plausibly 1914."

1. It must avoid *factual anachronism*. This includes refusing to answer things that *were* known in 1914. Be generous; if something was known/posited/theorized, but maybe not widely, and the model mentions it, that's OK. Anachronism can include aspects of vocabulary ("African American" is an anachronism, for example). 
1. Its attitude/outlook/vibes must be plausibly 1914. The bar here is intended to be low. But treatments of cultural difference, for instance, cannot be *too* open-minded in ways that would not have flown in period.
* DO NOT ding for "Here in 1914 we believe/know that ...." We just note that this is a general issue, but are not scoring it.

## General

**[Below info is to be superseded by our new working files. Up dates TK.]**

Labels are kept in the file `questions_with_answers.xlsm`.

There are three columns for labels, matching the three column headings for generations:

* `4omini-raw-ok`
* `4omini-ft-ok`
* `4obig-ok`

Label values are `true` or `false`. No other values are used, except that there are blanks where I have not yet provided a label. 

`true` means the generated response is OK, i.e., *does not* contain factual anachronism. 

`false` means that the response does contain one or more anachronisms. 

This labeling polarity matches Ted's use in `4oBigUntunedJudged.json`.
