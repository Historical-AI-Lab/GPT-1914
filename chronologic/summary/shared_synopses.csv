the rescue He had provided, and then I bore her along to the church,
thinking she needed the rites of sepulture; but I had scarcely entered
the sacred place, than she opened her eyes and breathed. So I gave
her such means of refreshment as I had about me, and by degrees the
sad lady came to herself; and to give her greater consolation, I bid
her observe she was no longer in the estate of a slave, but that by

231,30098.txt,"It is not difficult from the materials available to form a sufficiently
lively idea of this Venetian citizen of the sixteenth century, as father
and husband, host and painter. Ridolfi has collected a number of
anecdotes, which space forbids me to use, but which are all very
characteristic. We gather that he was a man of strong character,
generous, sincere and simple, decided in his ways, caring little for
the great world, but open-handed and hospitable under his own roof,
observant of men and manners, and sometimes rather brusque in dealing
with bores and offensive persons. Full of dry quiet humour and of
good-natured banter of his wife's little weaknesses. A man, too, of
upright conduct and free, as far as it can be ascertained, from any of
those laxities and infidelities, so freely quoted of celebrated men and
so easily condoned by his age. Art was Tintoretto's main preoccupation;
but he seems to have been a man of strong religious bias, making a close
study of the Bible, and turning naturally in his last days to those
truths with which his art had made him familiar, truths which he had
represented with that touch of mystic feeling which was the deepest part
of his nature.",,

former position at Cassville, they became engaged with a division of

killed by a cannon ball. This was a serious loss to the Confederacy.
He was a graduate of West Point; but after being graduated he took
work with the Episcopal church as bishop, but at the outbreak of the
war he entered the Confederate army and served with distinction. Only
a short time before his death it is reported that he administered the
ordinance of baptism to Generals Johnston and Hood. It is said that he
was rebuked by some of his church for taking up arms. He replied that
he felt as a man plowing in a field and was called by his neighbor to
help extinguish the flames from his house which was on fire, and after
the fire would go back to work. He was succeeded in command by General
Loring.",,
232,30098.txt,"M. Charles Yriarte has written a Life of Paolo Veronese, which is full
of charm and knowledge. It is interesting to take a copy of Boschini's
_Della pittura veneziana_, 1797, when visiting the galleries, the
palaces, and the churches of Venice. His lists of the pictures, as they
were known in his day, often open our eyes to doubtful attributions.
Second-hand copies of Boschini are not difficult to pick up. When the
later-century artists are reached, a good sketch of the Venice of their
period is supplied by Philippe Monnier's delightful _Venice in the
Eighteenth Century_ (Chatto and Windus), which also has a good chapter
on the lesser Venetian masters. The best Life of Tiepolo is in Italian,
by Professor Pompeo Molmenti. The smaller masters have to be hunted for
in many scattered essays; a knowledge of Goldoni adds point to Longhi's
pictures. Canaletto and his nephew, Belotto, have been treated by M.
Uzanne, _Les Deux Canaletto_; and Mr. Simonson has written an important
and charming volume on Francesco Guardi (Methuen, 1904), with beautiful
reproductions of his works. Among other books which give special
information are Morelli's two volumes, _Italian Painters in Borghese and
Doria Pamphili_, and _In Dresden and Munich Galleries_, translated by
Miss Jocelyn ffoulkes (Murray); and Dr. J. P. Richter's magnificent
catalogue of the Mond Collection--which, though published at fifteen

206,9850.txt,"Keats and Wither will serve as examples with which to finish our argument.
In spite of all that has been said Keats takes higher rank as poet than
Wither? Yes, certainly, but not because the poetic energy in him was a
finer thing than the poetic energy that was in Wither. It was more
constant, which is a fact of no little importance; its temper appealed to
a much more general sympathy, a circumstance which cannot be left out of
the reckoning; it touched a far wider range of significant material.
These things give Keats his just superiority of rank, but they do not
deprive Wither, at his best moments, of the essential quality which is
with Keats, as with all poets, the one by which he makes his proudest
claim good. Nor need it be feared that in allowing Wither, with his rare
moments of withdrawn and rather pale perfection, this the highest of all
distinctions, we are making accession to the title of poet too easy. It
remains the most difficult of all human attainments. The difference between

131,40293.txt,"The Revolution of 1830 was not only political, it was also artistic, and
the artistic results were really the more permanent. This artistic
revolution is generally known as the Romantic movement, about which so
much has been written that I need not refer to it at length. Just as the
Liberal spirit smouldered for many years against the Royalist
oppression, so the Romantic spirit smouldered against the restraints of
the dead classic tradition of the eighteenth century. The process of
combustion, beginning as it did with Rousseau, was a slow one, and, as
it has been said, Romanticism only potentially existed, as a movement,
before 1820. In that year Victor Hugo founded his journal, the
_Conservateur Littéraire_, gathering round him a brilliant company of
writers. For ten years the movement grew in intensity, fostered by the
institution of _cénacles_ and the only too successful proselytism of
Victor Hugo, who disdained no recruit whom he could by flattery enlist.
It is not too much to say that the youth of all France was fired by the
revolt against classicism in poetry and drama. Every schoolboy wrote
verses and every ardent soul longed to enter the very arena in Paris,
where the _perruques_ of the Institute were so signally defied. Paris
became doubly desirable as the field on which political and artistic
liberty were being won. The triumph came in 1830 with the performance of
""Hernani."" That victory of the Romantic army is now a commonplace, but
in 1830 it was magnificently new, and it was, moreover, the public
manifestation of _la Bohème_. The effect of this double excitement was
overwhelming. It literally tore the more intelligent among the young men
of France from the roots of all their attachments and interests. To
establish liberty, to revolutionize literature, these were their dreams,
in comparison with which all ordinary professional prospects seemed
dreary and unworthy. So the year 1830 saw Paris harbouring in her
garrets a host of enthusiasts, most of them very young, burning with
ideals and flushed with apparently glorious victories. They felt
themselves incorporated in one great brotherhood of defiance to
established authority, so that those who mocked their poverty and
lawlessness in the name ""Bohemian"" were unconsciously justified, for a
corporate name is the sign of a corporate existence. _La Bohème_ in 1830
was not a haphazard collection of _dilettanti_ and artistic eccentrics;
it was a fellowship inspired by similar enthusiasms and bound together
by the struggle against similar misfortunes.",,

there was no musician in Vienna who had not heard his name or felt some
expectation at his arrival. Before long, introduction had ripened into
acquaintance, and acquaintance into a many-sided friendship. Men were
glad to welcome a new genius of conspicuous power and encyclopædic
knowledge, who never spoke of himself, who never wrote a line in his
own defence, who never attacked an opponent, or depreciated a rival.
Add to this the quiet voice, the undemonstrative manner, the kindly
disposition that expended itself in a thousand services, the upright
honesty that would never stoop even to conquer, and it is not hard
to explain a personal popularity which has lasted unimpaired to the
present day. The artist is too often to be described in Mr. Stevenson’s
phrase, as ‘a man who sows hurry and reaps indigestion.’... It is

into the more backward collegiate bodies; the spontaneous development
of numerous clubs and associations—athletic, literary, or political—has
created many new ties among undergraduates, and weakened the old
exclusive spirit of college partisanship. The ‘Combined Lecture
System,’ under which the inmates of one college may receive instruction
in another, has also favoured a division of labour among tutors which
is directly conducive to specialism in teaching. The great extension
of the professoriate, including the new order of University Readers,
and still more the liberal encouragement of new studies, has infinitely
expanded the intellectual interests both of teachers and of students;
the admission of Nonconformists and the progress of free thought have
powerfully modified theological bigotry; the multiplication of feminine
influences has undermined the ideal of semi-monastic seclusion, and
greatly increased the innocent æsthetic distractions which are the
most formidable rivals of the austerer Muses. The gulf between Oxford
society and the great world outside, never very impassable, has been
effectually bridged over in every direction. A very large proportion
of professors and college tutors have travelled widely; many are well
known in London as contributors to scientific and literary periodicals
or otherwise; while Oxford itself is constantly thronged with visitors
from the metropolis. In ceasing to be clerical and aristocratic, the
University has become far more cosmopolitan; all religions are there
mingled harmoniously, nor is it uncommon to meet in the streets young
men of Oriental race and complexion wearing academical costume.",,

of thing happen to me in moments of crisis. I remember once detaining
a dentist with the drill at one of my lower bicuspids and holding him
up for nearly ten minutes with a story about a Scotchman, an Irishman,
and a Jew. Purely automatic. The more he tried to jab, the more I said
“Hoots, mon,” “Begorrah,” and “Oy, oy”. When one loses one’s nerve, one
simply babbles.",,
23,72729.txt,"In 1365 the Pope entered the lists against the University on behalf
of the friars, and directed the Archbishop of Canterbury and bishops
to insist upon the Chancellor’s procuring the repeal of the obnoxious
statutes. In the meantime, however, the intervention of the King and
Parliament was invoked by memorials from both the Universities and
the four mendicant Orders. In consequence of this an ordinance was
made, with the assent of Parliament, by which the statutes against the
admission of scholars into these Orders were relaxed, but all bulls and
processes to be procured by the friars against the Universities from
the Court of Rome were prohibited and declared void. Still the feud
continued. One main source of Wyclif’s popularity in the University was
his unsparing denunciation of the Mendicants, and their decline was
among the most permanent results of the movement which he initiated.
But other causes were at work to undermine their influence. The rise
of the colleges was, in fact, the rise of the secular clergy, and in
organising itself more completely, the University naturally outgrew
its dependence on the missionary zeal for education which had been its
life-blood in the thirteenth century.",,
259,1936.txt,". . . On Tuesday Mr. Hallam took us to the British Museum, and being a
director, he could enter on a private day, when we were not annoyed by a
crowd, and, moreover, we had the advantage of the best interpreters and
guides.  We did not even enter the library, which requires a day by
itself, but confined ourselves to the Antiquity rooms. . . . As I entered
the room devoted to the Elgin marbles, the works of the “divine Phidias,”
I stepped with awe, as if entering a temple, and the Secretary, who was
by my side, observing it, told me that the Grand Duke Constantine, when
he came a few days before, made, as he entered, a most profound and
reverential bow.  This was one of my most delightful mornings, and I left
the Antiquities with a stronger desire to see them again than before I
had seen them at all.",,
201,9850.txt,"Of all the energies of man, that which I will anticipate my argument by
calling the poetic energy, the energy that created Herrick's song and the
distinguishing qualities of that passage from Milton, is the rarest and the
most highly, if not the most generally, honoured; we have only to think of
the handful of men who at any time out of all the millions can bring this
perfect expression to a mood of the highest imaginative intensity, to know
that the honour is justly bestowed. So splendid a thing is success in
this matter that failure, if it is matched with a will for sincerity and
intelligence of purpose, will often bring a man some durable fame. But the
energies of man are manifold, and while we rightly set the poetic energy
above the rest, there are others which are only less rare, and in their
most notable manifestations yielding to it alone in worthiness of homage
which will, indeed, often be more generally paid. Such an energy is the
profound intellectual control of material, as distinct from profound
emotional sensitiveness to material; the capacity for ordering great masses
of detail into a whole of finely balanced and duly related proportions.
Cæsar and Napoleon had it, marshalling great armies to perfectly conceived
designs; Fielding had it, using it to draw a multitude of character and
event into the superbly shaped lines of his story; the greatest political
leaders have had it; Cromwell had it, organising an enthusiasm; Elizabeth,
organising a national adventure.[1] Again, there is the energy
of morality, ardently desiring justice and right fellowship, sublimely
lived by men who have made goodness great, like Lincoln, sublimely spoken
by men who made sermons passionate, like Ruskin and Carlyle. To take one
other instance, there is the highly specialised energy that delights in the
objective perception of differentiations of character, the chief energy of
the deftest wits such as Samuel Johnson and the best comic dramatists.",,
227,13252.txt,"As to the Music,--well, I am not a musician, and in any new Opera when
there is no one tuneful phrase as in _Aïda_ or _Tannhäuser_, which, at
the very first hearing, anyone with half an ear can straightway catch,
and reproduce next day till everyone about him cries, ""Oh don't!"" and
when, as in this instance, the conducting-composer, Wagnerianly, will
not permit _encores_--where am I? Nowhere. I return home in common
time, but tuneless. On the other hand, besides being certain that
_Friar Tuck's_ jovial song will ""catch on,"" I must record the complete
satisfaction with which I heard the substantial whack on the drum so
descriptive of _Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert-sans-Sullivan's_ heavy fall
""at the ropes."" This last effect, being as novel as it is effective,
attracted the attention of the wily and observant DRURIOLANUS, who
mentally booked the effect as something startlingly new and original
for his next Pantomime. The combat between the Saxon Slogger, very
much out of training, and the Norman Nobbler, rather over-trained
as the result proved, is decidedly exciting, and the Nobbler would
be backed at long odds. Altogether, the whole show was thoroughly
appreciated by WAMBA JUNIOR.",,
69,70203.txt,"In the important form of the String Quartett Brahms has left only three
works, viz.: two (in C minor and A minor), op. 51, and one (in B♭),
op. 67. The number is few as compared with the other great masters,
and especially of course with Haydn, but the quality of each work is
remarkable. In England, at any rate, these quartetts have met with a
cautious and critical reception. The reason for this is, no doubt,
that for their true appreciation they require study and many hearings,
conditions which unfortunately are not common amongst us. Amateurs,
however, who play them, and know them intimately, will hardly share
in these adverse opinions. Some of the movements have been spoken of
as lacking in inspiration, an opinion which, if one accepts Brahms at
all, seems strange, for in none of his works does his peculiar genius
shine more clearly through the medium in which he works than in these.
One may reject Brahms altogether, falling foul of his idioms and
methods, as some do, but it is hard to understand how compositions so
characteristic as these can be rejected by any who rank themselves as
students or disciples of this master. The slow movements of all these
string quartetts may be referred to as showing with what true melodic
charm Brahms can invest his music, and this is all the more notable if
one considers the unusual manner in which the beautiful tunes are often
presented. For example, the romance of No. 1 in C minor:—",,

53,75590.txt,"After this meeting we took our leave of Friends, parting in great
tenderness, in the sense of the heavenly life and virtuous power of
the Lord, that was livingly felt amongst us; and went by water to
the place where we were to take shipping, many Friends accompanying
us thither and tarrying with us that night. Next day, the 21st of
the 3rd month, 1673, we set sail for England; the same day Richard
Covell came on board our ship, having had his own taken from him by
the Dutch. We had foul weather and contrary winds, which caused us
to cast anchor often, so that we were till the 31st ere we could get
past the capes of Virginia and come out into the main sea. But after
this we made good speed, and on the 28th of the 4th month cast
anchor at King’s Road, which is the harbour for BRISTOL. We had on
our passage very high winds and tempestuous weather, which made the
sea exceedingly rough, the waves rising like mountains; so that the
masters and sailors wondered at it, and said they never saw the like
before. But though the wind was strong, it set for the most part
with us, so that we sailed before it; and the great God who commands
the winds, who is Lord of heaven, of earth, and the seas, and whose
wonders are seen in the deep, steered our course and preserved us
from many imminent dangers. The same good hand of Providence that
went with us, and carried us safely over, watched over us in our
return, and brought us safely back again; thanksgiving and praises
be to his holy name for ever! Many sweet and precious meetings we
had on board the ship during this voyage (commonly two a week,)
wherein the blessed presence of the Lord did greatly refresh us, and
often break in upon and tender the company.",,
