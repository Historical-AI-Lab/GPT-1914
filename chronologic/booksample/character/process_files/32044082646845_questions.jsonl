Gideon felt sure that he would not. Well, he must shoot, there was nothing else for it. As Stephanus came nearer Gideon could see clearly the silvery whiteness of his beard. He thought of the last time his eyes had rested on his brother's face, when the sentence was pronounced, and that then the beard was as black as the wing of a raven. Then a sudden horror struck him to the heart. He could not COULD NOT stain his already guilty hands with this man's blood, after having ruined his life. The threatened curse of \n\nCain thundered in his ears. With a wild shriek he sprang from the wagon, and fled among the naked, piled-up rocks which formed the base of the \n\n---\nhideous mountain at the foot of which his wagon stood. Unheeding the shout of Stephanus, Gideon sped on, leaping from boulder to boulder in his mad endeavour to avoid the presence of the man against whom he had so terribly sinned. By some curious trick of thought his brother, thus unarmed, was more formidable to his maddened and guilty soul than had he come with a primed and loaded gun. A dread of some such fascination as the snake is said to exercise over his victim possessed him; he felt that once under his brother's eyes he would be bound and helpless. It was a terrible illustration of the dread which the malefactor sometimes feels towards the one he has wronged. Stephanus followed steadily, his heart full of its lofty purpose. He knew that his brother could not escape him now, that the moment he had longed for through the slow years was at hand. Serene in his trust, confident in his faith that Providence was directing his and Gideon's steps, and that neither could stumble until God's purpose had been fulfilled, he breasted the steep, rugged incline with a careful and methodical expenditure of energy. Soon the mountain narrowed to a wedge-shaped slope of an easier gradient, which culminated in a naked peak on each side of which a black gulf yawned. Under this, at a sheer depth which it made the senses dizzy to contemplate, the mighty river, now turbidly brimming from the heavy thunder-rains which had fallen upon its course, rolled down between fringes of tall green timber. When Gideon saw that he was trapped,—that in front of him and on either hand were perpendicular cliffs, and behind him the brother whose face he dreaded more than the face of Death, such a mighty cry of agony and despair issued from his deep chest that the dead, black chasms seemed for the instant to become peopled with lost souls. Then, nerved with the courage of despair he turned and faced his pursuer. 66 \n\nKeep back-keep back-\" he shouted hoarsely, \"or I will shoot you dead and follow you to Hell over the krantz.” \n\nYou cannot do it, my brother,\" called out \n\nStephanus; \"the shield of the Lord would turn the bullet aside and His hand would bear you up from the depths.\" \"Stand, I tell you.-Stand.-Another step and you are a dead man.” \n\nStephanus continued to approach, so Gideon lifted his gun and pulled the trigger, but the powder flashed in the pan. Stephanus never faltered, but walked composedly to where the desperate man was hastily endeavouring to reprime the gun with loose powder from his pocket. Stephanus laid his hand on his brother's shoulder and Gideon at once ceased in his attempt, the gun slipped from his nervous fingers and crashed upon the stones, and he sank, swooning, to the ground. When he regained consciousness Gideon found himself supported by the arms of his brother, whose eyes, deep with love and dimmed with pity, looked\nsteadily into his own. Then his sin, his anguish and his terror slipped from him like a cast-off garment, and for the first time in his manhood he wept."}

Gideon, also, had more than once thought of going to visit his sister-in-law, but the dread of again meeting what he had read in her eyes on the day of the trial held him back. It was currently known that Marta was in bad health and that Uncle\n\nDiederick had been called in to prescribe for her more than once. Thus the weary days dragged on through three weary years, but the stricken household kept no count of time. In material things Gideon prospered. Each season the years came with unusual regularity, and his flocks and herds increased until he became rich among his fellows. One day two figures were seen approaching from the direction of Stephanus' homestead. They turned out to be those of the blind girl, Elsie, and a very diminutive Bushman lad named Kanu, who had\ngrown up on the farm. Kanu had been captured as a child, years before, in the course of an exterminating raid upon some Bushman depredators at their stronghold in an almost inaccessible part of the \n\nRoggeveld Mountains. Kanu was about sixteen years of age. From her early childhood he had devoted himself to the service of the blind girl; at last his devotion had grown to positive worship. In Kanu's company Elsie would wander far and wide, over mountain and plain, in perfect safety. The Bushman had picked up a smattering of Dutch, but still spoke his own tongue fluently, for there were a number of semi-domesticated Bushman servants on the farm-captives from different raids. Such raids were, no doubt, sometimes rendered necessary by the plundering propensities of the pygmy sons of Ishmael, but there was another side of the question: where Bushmen were plentiful the \n\nBoers did not, as a rule, find it necessary to purchase slaves. The blind child was led by her guide to the front door of the house, which stood open. The day was hot and the family were sitting at table, trying to hurry through their dismal midday meal. Elsie crossed the threshold without knocking and stood at her Uncle's side. Her hair hung below her waist in a rich, yellow mass, and her eyes gleamed as they always did under the influence of excitement, and in appropriate light. The three sitting at the table sat and gazed at her in silent and startled surprise. \"Uncle Gideon,\" she said in a clear, piercing voice. \"Well,-\" said Gideon in a voice of forced roughness, \"what do you want?\" \"My mother bids me tell you that she is dying, and that you must come to her at once.\" Gideon rose to his feet, his face twitching. Elsie slowly turned, held out her hand for the guiding twig which Kanu extended to her, and stepped swiftly forth. Within the space of a few minutes Gideon sprang on a horse and galloped off in the direction of the homestead where the woman he loved lay dying. Marta sent one of the servants to fetch a span of oxen, and soon followed her husband, in a wagon. When Gideon arrived at Marta's homestead he could at once see that directions had been given as to the details of his reception. As he ascended the steep flight of steps which led to the voorhuis the door swayed open and revealed the weeping figure of \n\nSara, his niece. Walking on tip-toe she beckoned to him to follow her, and led the way to an inner room, the door of which stood ajar. Gideon entered, every nerve in his body tingling with apprehension. Sara softly closed the door behind him, and then he heard her retreating footsteps upon the clay floor of the passage. The dying woman lay propped up in bed, her cheeks flushed and her lips parted in a smile of loving welcome. She looked, for the moment, not more than twenty years of age."}

This was, of course, a very fortunate circumstance for the \n\nBushman. Had he ever been found and recognised, it is to be feared that a short shrift and a round bullet would have been his portion. CHAPTER XIV  \n\nALETTA, who had mentally and physically become grey like her surroundings, like a tree growing in a damp and dark corner which has long since given up the attempt to shine and bourgeon like its fellows that rejoice in the sunlight-received the news of Elsie's having been found with but a faint shock of surprise and satisfaction. Her perceptions had become dulled by the woe-laden years. Sara had, some two years previously, married a young farmer from an adjoining district. Uncle Diederick was glad of the opportunity of visiting Cape Town; he had heard of some wonderful new discoveries in the drug line, and he wanted to advance professionally with the times. His farming on joint behalf of himself and Stephanus had prospered. He felt that when his (at present) sleeping partner should be released, he, Uncle\n\nDiederick, would be able to build himself another \"hartebeeste house\" of ample proportions and sumptuous style, and devote his energies exclusively to the exercise of that healing art which his whole soul loved. Adrian had-being of a careful and frugal 125\nyoung. nature-begun acquiring stock when still very This had increased considerably, owing to a long series of excellent seasons and the exercise of careful management. Thus, he had recently found himself quite rich enough to start farming on his own account. When, however, he mooted this contingency with his father, Gideon at once offered him a full partnership in the farm as a going concern, leaving him the unrestricted management and only stipulating for the supply of teams of oxen and relays of horses for use on the hunting trips upon which he now spent by far the greater proportion of his time. Adrian at once closed with the offer. Whilst Uncle Diederick was making preparations for his trip the thought struck Adrian that the present might prove a good opportunity for him to visit that city which he had never yet seen. He felt that not alone could he make the journey pay its expenses, but that a handsome profit might be won by taking down a load of produce and bringing back another of supplies. So he overhauled his wagon, packed it with ostrich feathers and hides and then sent over to tell Uncle Diederick of his intention. Uncle Diederick had arranged to start on the third day following. Adrian's notification came in the form of a message sent through a Hottentot who was directed to enquire as to the hour of Uncle \n\nDiederick's intended departure, so that the wagon might arrive at the spot where the two roads from the respective homesteads met, at the same time. Up to this it had been understood that Jacomina was to remain behind and attend to any patients who might turn up. \"Pa,\" said that artless damsel, at supper, \"it will be very lonely here while you are away.\" A quizzical expression crinkled over the witheredapple-like visage of Uncle Diederick. Otherwise he impassively went on with his meal. Yes, and I have never seen Cape Town. Besides Elsie will be very lonely on the road if there is not another girl to talk to and look after her.\" After she had obtained her father's consent \n\nJacomina began at once making preparations for her trip. Her best frock was taken from the box and thoroughly overhauled, her smartest cappie and her newest veldschoens were laid ready for the morrow. A brooch of old workmanship and some other trinkets which had drifted into Uncle Diederick's coffers in the course of trade, and thence been annexed by his daughter as part of her share in the profits, were examined and judiciously selected from."}

Adrian gradually gathered her into his arms, and she allowed herself to be consoled. After a very few minutes a full understanding was arrived at; then Jacomina recovered herself with remarkable rapidity, and recollected that the wagons were far ahead. Adrian's shyness had by this time completely gone, so much so that Jacomina had some difficulty in getting him to make a start. In fact she had to escape from his arms by means of a subterfuge and dart away along the road. Her lover did not lose much time in following her. The course was interrupted by amatory interludes whenever the wayside boskage was propitious, so it was not before the outspanning took place that the wagons were reached. When the blushing pair stood before Uncle\n\nDiederick, that man of experiences did not need to have matters explained to him. \"Well, Jacomina,\" he said, \"I'll have to see about getting a wife myself now. But you need not be afraid on account of Aunt Emerencia; no one, who is not a fool, buys an old mare when he can get a young one for the same price.\" Uncle Diederick, who had not been to Cape Town since the days of his early youth, was very much impressed by everything he saw, but by nothing so much as the chemists' shops. He never got tired at gazing at the rows of bottles with their various coloured contents. He wandered from one drug emporium to another, until he made the acquaint-\nance of an affable young assistant who dispensed with an engaging air from behind a counter deeply laden with wondrous appliances and enticing compounds. This young man loved experiment for its own sake, and he had a wide field for the exercise of his hobby among the poorer classes, who usually came to him for panaceas for their minor ills. As Paul sat at the feet of Gamaliel, Uncle Diederick sat on a high-legged stool in the chemist's shop, drinking in greedily the lore which fell from the young man's lips, and making notes of the same in a tattered pocket-book, with a very stumpy pencil. Thus Uncle Diederick widened his medical knowledge considerably, until he felt that all worth knowing of the healing art was now at his command. The young man was the only one who suffered; his moral character became sadly deteriorated owing to the reverence with which Uncle Diederick regarded him, and the wrapt attention with which every essay of his was observed and recorded. Eventually Uncle Diederick placed an order worth about ten pounds at the shop, and obtained copious directions as to treatment of the different maladies which the contents of each bulky bottle might be expected to cure. The wagons had outspanned on the mountain slope, not far below the du Plessis' dwelling. Jacomina was much impressed at the luxuriousness of Elsie's surroundings and the quality of the stuff of which her garments were made. Gertrude and Helena tried to be civil and attentive to Jacomina and Adrian but-well, Jacomina was not long in seeing that the\ntwo town-bred girls were much more attractive than she was herself, and she did not care to appear at a disadvantage before her lover. Elsie she did not at first feel jealous of. As she expressed it to Adrian, the blind girl reminded her of the great peak at the head of the Tanqua valley, when it was covered with snow in winter. One day, however, she observed a look upon Adrian's face as he was regarding his cousin, which made her resolve to hurry on the wedding at all hazards. At the lower end of Plein Street was a shop, a mere contemplation of the contents of which filled Jacomina's soul with satisfaction. It was a large emporium, specially stocked and arranged for the purpose of supplying the needs of the farmers visiting the metropolis. At this establishment produce of all kinds was purchased, the value being usually taken out in goods-a double profit thus being secured by the management."}

A strange duality was set up in his consciousness :-it seemed as though the man he had seen undergoing sentence, although still his brother, was no longer the Stephanus who had used him so despitefully. Thus his mind was buffeted hither and thither by a gusty storm of conflicting emotions.

He felt no remorse for what he had done; on the contrary, his inability to enjoy the revenge he had long panted for, was the cause of redoubled resentment against his enemy. After greeting his family with forced cheerfulness, Gideon drank a cup of coffee and at once retired to bed, saying that he felt fatigued after his long journey. His wife, Aletta, was not deceived by his demeanour, but there was that in his face which caused her to forbear asking any questions. 38\nNext morning Gideon tried to avoid everybody, and it was not until midday that Aletta contrived to satisfy her painful suspense in regard to the result of the trial. He was then standing at the back of the wagon-house with bent head and an air of painful preoccupation. He did not hear her approaching footsteps. When she laid a hesitating hand upon his arm he started as though he had been struck, and looked at her with troubled eyes. \"Gideon,\" she said in a low and hurried tone- \"tell me about Stephanus.\" \"The wolf is in a trap;\" he said with a savage laugh\" for ten long years he will have to bite the door before it opens.' \"Ten years\" repeated Aletta in an awed whisper-\" poor Stephanus; I did not think it would have gone so hard with him.\" \"Aletta,\" he broke out wrathfully,\" are you taking the part of this wolf-this jackal in a man's skin, against me?\" \"6 \n\nNo-no-Gideon,—I do not take his part ;-but ten years is such a long time.—And I was thinking of \n\nMarta and the children; they will never see him again.\" \"And a good thing too.

Each, brought into daily contact with the black rancour displayed by her husband, had thought that the feeling could not possibly be so bad on the other side. Weary as had been the days to Aletta and Adrian, those which followed were wearier still. black cloud seemed to brood over the household. No one ever smiled. Each avoided the eyes of the others as though fearful of what the eyes might read or reveal.

How had the misunderstanding arisen; who was to blame?— \n\nStephanus always hated you and I loved you all\nthe time-Aletta need not know-I only tell you now that I am dying-\"\n\nGideon tenderly took the wasted hand and laid it against his rugged cheek. \"My children-I love them-Let them not suffer for their father's sin-\" \"Wait, Marta-\" said Gideon in a strained and trembling voice, \"I must tell you—” \n\n\"There is nothing to tell-I know it all. He got to know I loved you and he tried to kill you.— \n\nForgive him, if you can, for my sake—\" \"Wait, Marta,-I must tell you the truth—you are wrong—I must tell you the truth, even if it kills us both.\" The dying woman's lips became compressed, and the colour began to fade from her cheeks. Gideon tried to move so that her eyes, full of startled interrogatory and the pain of apprehension, might not rest upon his face whilst he made his confession, but they followed and held his spell-bound. Then in a hoarse, broken murmur he said: \"Stephanus shot me by accident-I accused him falsely because I hated him all my life.\" When he ceased speaking he drooped his head and hid his face among the bed-clothes next to \n\nMarta's shoulder. A slight shudder went through the woman's frame and then she ceased to breathe. Gideon kept his head bowed for a long time. When, by a torturing effort he lifted it, he saw a dead, ashen face lying on the pillow at his side, the face of an old woman who seemed to have died in sharp agony. When Gideon left the chamber of death he moved like a man in a dream. Mounting his horse mechanically he allowed the animal to stray homewards at a walk. He met the wagon in which Aletta was hurrying to the death-bed as fast as the team of oxen could bring her, but he passed it without recognition. The pathway led past the spring, the scene of the three-years' past tragedy. The day was hot and the horse turned aside to drink as was its wont. It was not until the animal paused and bent its head to the water that the rider recognised the locality. He was quite calm and the environment in which he found himself seemed appropriate to his mood. He dismounted when the horse had finished drinking, led it away to a spot where it could graze, a few paces distant, and then returned to the water-side. He went over the whole scene anew."}

The du Plessis' were spending the day on the western side of the peninsula, where the South Atlantic tides, steel-grey and cold, sweep past the black, broken rocks. To landward the bastioned turrets known as the \"Twelve \n\nApostles\" soared into a blue sky; from seaward the rollers were thundering up, in front of a steady northwest breeze. Elsie had been placed in a comfortable situation such as she loved-safe above the reach of the moving waters, but where faint fragrant whiffs of spray might now and then reach her, and where the generous sunshine prevented her from feeling chilled. She loved sometimes to be left alone thus, so the others wandered away. deep sleep.

You will remember it all by and by.\" ELSIE'S AWAKENING \n\n115 Helena drew the blind, frightened face down upon her generous breast, whilst Gertrude softly stroked the rigid hand which had seized one of hers with such a convulsive grasp as caused her acute pain. The blind girl's brain was reeling perilously near to madness. Like a flood came the memory of her journey and its purpose of the misery of disappointment, and the terror of the baboons. Her mind began anew at the flight from Elandsfontein, and retraced every painful step of the journey which came to such a tragic close in the inhospitable streets of the city. The whole pageant went through her consciousness in a whirling phantasmagoria. When she reached that stage of her adventures wherein she left the dwelling of the kind old coloured woman, she instinctively passed her hand over her knees to feel if she still wore the dress which had been lent her then. Again she ascended the rugged slopes of Table Mountain, with her ears filled with the horrid shouts of the persecuting boys. The longwaited-for Kanu seemed so imminent that she bent her ear to listen for his expected step in the sound of the rocking surf. Then her terror of the baboons returned upon her like a hurricane sweeping everything away in fury; she started up with a shriek and tried to rush away. \"Oh God, the baboons. Kanu-Kanu.\" \"Hush-hush, dear,\" said the soothing voice of \n\nHelena; \"you are safe with us; nothing can hurt you. Feel--we are holding you safely.\" The sudden rupture of the cells in the blind girl's brain, within which the terrors of that dire morning\nof four years back were pent, was like the breaking of the Seventh Seal. The shock almost unseated her reason. However, she gradually came to realise that she was with friends, whose tender touch brought comfort and a sense of safety. For the moment the last four years of her life were as effectually blotted out as though they had never been."}

When \n\nAletta told him of Elsie's return he started violently and turned deadly pale. He did not ask where his niece had been. As his wife descanted with nervous volubility upon the mystery, and explained how she had been unsuccessful in eliciting from Elsie any particulars of her flight and subsequent adventures, Gideon found himself wondering whether it would not be possible for him to get away secretly and return to the wilderness, thus to avoid meeting the accusing look of the blind eyes that he remembered so well and dreaded so sorely. But Elsie just then stepped softly into the room. \"Where is Uncle Gideon ?\" she said in a soft voice. Gideon gazed in speechless astonishment at Elsie. His apprehensive eye wandered over her graceful form and her pallid, beautiful face. He noticed how her figure had developed and how the gold had deepened in her hair. As Aletta tremblingly led her forward to the bench upon which Gideon was seated the unhappy man quailed and tried vainly to avoid the blind, accusing eyes, which seemed to seek his and to hold them when found. Elsie lifted her hands and placed them on his shoulders. \"Uncle Gideon,\" she said, \"my father sent me back to live with you until his release.\" Gideon murmured some unintelligible words. Elsie passed her hands lightly over his features. Aletta quietly left the room. \"Yes,\" said Elsie, \"you have suffered; I will try to comfort you, Uncle Gideon.\" A sense of immediate relief came over the unhappy man. It was now clear to him that Stephanus could not have told her the truth about the tragedy at the spring, or else she would never have met him and spoken to him as she did. So far it was well, but the fact of Stephanus not having taken her into his confidence was a proof of the implacability of his mind. But in an instant his mind rushed to another conclusion: this blind creature who loved her wronged father so utterly,-was it not certain that her desire for vengeance must be as keen as his? But he would balk them both by plunging again into the wilderness-so far, this time, that he would never be able to return. \"A good way to comfort one,\" he growled ungraciously, \"to wander away with a Bushman and make us run all over the country looking for you.\" \"Would you like to know, truly, why I went, Uncle Gideon ?\" \"Oh, as you are back all right now and have had enough to eat, wherever you have been, it does not matter; you can tell me some other time.—Only you must not do such a thing again.\" 'No, there will be no need for me to do the like again.\" Gideon left the room, feeling more and more puzzled. Each one of Elsie's ambiguous remarks sent his speculations farther and farther afield. One thing only was clear to him,-it was time to carry out that intention which had been gradually growing\nELSIE'S RETURN \n\n149 of late years as time went by and his brother did not, as the miserable man had confidently expected, die in prison. This was the intention, previously unformulated, of finally leaving wife, home and everything else and trekking to some unknown spot far beyond the great, mysterious Gariep,—to some spot so distant that his brother's vengeance would not be able to reach him, and there spending the remnant of his miserable days. To do Gideon but justice, the strongest element in his dread of meeting Stephanus was not physical but moral. He felt he could not bear to confront the stern accusation which he pictured as arising in the injured man's piercing eyes."}
