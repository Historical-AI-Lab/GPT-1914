anachronism
===========

Experiments to measure the anachronistic deviation of LLM responses when they are asked to reproduce the style and content of earlier eras. We also inquire how far this can be addressed by RAG or fine-tuning, and how far fixing it requires pretraining on a period corpus.

The list of HTids held out from GPT-1914 is in HeldOutListNoDupes.txt. The tsv files HeldOutRecords1905-14_nodupes.tsv and HeldOutRecords1905-14.tsv contain fuller metadata for this list; the second file contains multiple volumes in cases where a title occurred in multiple copies.
