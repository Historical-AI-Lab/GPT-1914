This brings us to the qualifications of councillors. No one can be elected an ordinary councillor nor (therefore) an alderman or chairman of a county council, [masked clause describing a condition or proviso], or be a peer owning property in the county, or be a parliamentary voter registered as such in respect of the ownership of property in the county. To be qualified as a borough councillor a man must be either entitled, by virtue of burgess qualification, to be registered as an elector, or be qualified in all respects save that of residence within the 1 This virtually makes it necessary to fix the number of the ordinary councillors at some multiple of three.\n\nWrite a clause appropriate for this book that could stand in the position marked by [masked clause describing a condition or proviso]:", "source_title": "An Outline of English Local Government", "source_author": "Edward Jenks", "source_date": 0, "author_nationality": "UK", "source_genre": "novel", "author_birth": 1861, "author_profession": "", "source_htid": "hvd.hwysm9", "question_category": "cloze_conditionalclause", "question_process": "automatic", "answer_types": ["ground_truth", "negation", "same_book", "same_book", "anachronistic_metadataless_mistral-small:24b", "anachronistic_gpt-oss:20b"], "answer_strings": ["unless he be either qualified to be councillor of a borough within the county", "if he be neither qualified to be councillor of a borough within the county", "if so many there be duly qualified in his county", "if this derivation be correct", "unless he is an elector of another county", "we need to produce a clause of roughly 14 words that uses a term such as if, provided that, insofar as, or unless. The clause must fit the context: \"No one can be elected an ordinary councillor nor (therefore) an alderman or chairman of a county council, [masked clause describing a condition or proviso], or be a peer owning property in the county, or be a parliamentary voter registered as such in respect of the ownership of property in the county.\"\n\nSo the clause should be something like \"unless they are a member of the municipal corporation\" or \"provided that they are not a member of the municipal corporation\" or \"if they are a member of the municipal corporation\" etc. But we need 14 words. Let's count.\n\nWe need a clause that uses \"if, provided that, insofar as, or unless\". Let's pick \"unless\". For example: \"unless they are a member of the municipal corporation, or have a conflict of interest\". Count words: \"unless(1) they2 are3 a4 member5 of6 the7 municipal8 corporation,9 or10 have11 a12 conflict13 of14 interest15.\" That's 15 words. We need roughly 14 words. We can drop \"a\" or \"the\". Let's try: \"unless they are member of municipal corporation, or have conflict of interest.\" Count: unless1 they2 are3 member4 of5 municipal6 corporation,7 or8 have9 conflict10 of11 interest12. That's 12 words. We need roughly 14 words, maybe 13-15. Let's add \"any\" or \"public\" or \"in\". For instance: \"unless they are member of municipal corporation, or have any conflict of interest.\" Count: unless1 they2 are3 member4 of5 municipal6 corporation,7 or8 have9 any10 conflict11 of12 interest13. That's 13 words. Good. But \"member of municipal corporation\" maybe unnatural. Could be \"member of the municipal corporation\" but then count changes. Let's keep as \"member of municipal corporation\". 13 words is fine.\n\nBut the clause might be: \"unless they are a member of the municipal corporation, or have any conflict of interest.\" Count: unless1 they2 are3 a4 member5 of6 the7 municipal8 corporation,9 or10 have11 any12 conflict13 of14 interest15. 15 words. 15 maybe okay but they said roughly 14 words. 15 is close. Let's aim for 14.\n\nLet's try: \"unless they are member of municipal corporation, or possess any conflict of interest.\" Count: unless1 they2 are3 member4 of5 municipal6 corporation,7 or8 possess9 any10 conflict11 of12 interest13. 13 words. Good.\n\nAlternatively: \"unless they are a municipal corporation member, or hold any conflict of interest.\" Count: unless1 they2 are3 a4 municipal5 corporation6 member,7 or8 hold9 any10 conflict11 of12 interest13. 13 words.\n\nBut we used \"unless\". The clause could be \"unless they are a municipal corporation member, or hold any conflict of interest.\" That's 13 words. Good.\n\nAlternatively using \"provided that\": \"provided that they are not a municipal corporation member, nor hold any conflict of interest.\" Count: provided1 that2 they3 are4 not5 a6 municipal7 corporation8 member,9 nor10 hold11 any12 conflict13 of14 interest15. 15 words.\n\nLet's pick one with 14 words. For example: \"unless they are a municipal corporation member, or possess any conflict of interest.\" Count: unless1 they2 are3 a4 municipal5 corporation6 member,7 or8 possess9 any10 conflict11 of12 interest13. 13 words. Add \"public\" maybe: \"unless they are a municipal corporation member, or possess any public conflict of interest.\" Count: unless1 they2 are3 a4 municipal5 corporation6 member,7 or8 possess9 any10 public11 conflict12 of13 interest14. That's 14 words. Good.\n\nThus clause: unless they are a municipal corporation member, or possess any public conflict of interest.\n\nCheck: The clause uses \"unless\". It's 14 words. It fits context: \"No one can be elected ... unless they are a municipal corporation member, or possess any public conflict of interest.\" Wait that would allow election if they are a member of municipal corporation, but we want to prohibit. Actually the clause should be a condition for disqualification: \"No one can be elected ... unless they are a municipal corporation member, or possess any public conflict of interest.\" That would mean only those who are municipal corporation members or have conflict can be elected? That seems wrong. The clause should be a restriction: \"unless they are a municipal corporation member\" would mean if they are a member, they cannot be elected. But the phrase \"unless\" indicates exception. Let's think: \"No one can be elected ... unless they are a municipal corporation member, or possess any public conflict of interest.\" Means the only ones who can be elected are those who are municipal corporation members or have conflict? That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe better: \"unless they are a member of the municipal corporation, or hold any public conflict of interest.\" That still uses unless incorrectly. The clause is inserted after \"nor\". The structure: \"No one can be elected ... nor (therefore) an alderman or chairman of a county council, [masked clause], or be a peer owning property in the county, or be a parliamentary voter registered as such in respect of the ownership of property in the county.\" So the masked clause is a condition that disqualifies them.
