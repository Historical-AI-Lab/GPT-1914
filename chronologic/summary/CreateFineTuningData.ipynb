He lived (1797-1828) in Vienna at the same time as\\nBeethoven, and many of his compositions show distinctly how much\\nhe was influenced by the genius of that great musician. Schubert’s\\nworks are distinguished by a spontaneous flow of beautiful melody.\\nHe possessed, by right of nature, the utmost artistic opulence, but\\nunfortunately, owing chiefly to his birth and early circumstances, this\\nwas not consolidated by that profounder culture which is necessary for\\nthe fullest expression of human capacity. Not that Schubert failed\\nto reach a most exalted position, for works like the B♭ Piano Trio,\\nthe C major Quintett, that noble fragment the B minor Symphony, and\\nespecially his best songs, proclaim him unsurpassed by any musician\\nof modern times; but out of the very profusion of his ideas, combined\\nwith a certain want of restraint and self-criticism, arose an artistic\\ndanger, the result of which is most evident in his larger works. This,\\ntoo, is probably the reason why he was so great as a composer of songs,\\nfor he had all the means ready at hand for the expression which the\\ntext required, and the form being necessarily free, he could and did\\nwork in an unfettered fashion, with the most wonderful results. That\\nthis is so, such _Lieder_ as “The Erl King,” “Gretchen at the\\nSpinning-wheel,” “The Wanderer,” and many others, abundantly prove.\\nLiszt, who greatly advocated his works, called Schubert “the most\\npoetical of all the musicians,” and Schumann characteristically writes\\nthus of the Piano Trio in B♭:—“One glance at this trio, and all the\\npitiful clouds of life disperse and the world shines again as fresh\\nand bright as ever. This work is indeed a precious legacy. Many and\\nbeautiful as are the things which time brings forth, it will be long\\nere it produces another Schubert.” Franz Schubert, known for his spontaneous melodic genius and prolific output despite some artistic limitations in his larger compositions, achieved an exalted musical standing through his celebrated songs and remarkable instrumental works, garnering high acclaim from contemporaries and later musicians.'}"
