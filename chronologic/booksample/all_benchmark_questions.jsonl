There was a blur, too, before his eyes, and he hardly knew what was going on around him. That is, he was soon aware that two pairs of strong arms went around him, one after the other, and that he was enthusiastically welcomed by a couple of bronzed and bearded men in rusty uniforms which might never have been as brilliant as was his own. Then he was led into a tent, and only those two men were with him. It was a grand time for \n\nLee, and all the reporting he had performed for General Washington or anybody else was as nothing compared to the account which he had to give of himself and his doings during the many long months since the Bowie brothers had looked each other in the face. It was a long, long talk, and it was a late hour in the night when the major and the captain, for such they were, went away to their rest and their soldier duties so that their newly found, or rather rediscovered, brother could lie down upon his French blanket and go to sleep. He did so with a curious idea floating around in his mind that it would be almost beyond belief, next morning, to wake up with-\nout any help from the British drum-taps and not have to go out and feed and curry the horses of the king's cavalry. As for them, they had been his companions so long that even while his eyes were closing he drowsily raised his head and listened to hear if there were possibly any disturbance among them. He slept soundly and long, but it was no drum-beat that awakened him. It was the roar of a heavy gun, for Washington now knew what was to be the next movement of Lord Cornwallis, and he had ordered a forward movement which was intended to encourage his lordship in retiring within his inner line of entrenchments. CHAPTER XVIII  \n\nIr was a dark night, and it appeared to be especially gloomy over the wide, unoccupied space between the British lines and the camps of the American army before Yorktown. Among these there were camp-fires burning, and there were lanterns moving here and there. One of these lanterns passed by the huts and tents of the Maryland line at about half-past seven o'clock, and it found Lee Bowie standing in front of a tent, leaning upon his beautiful new musket. He was not there on duty, however, and it was not the mere light of the lantern which gave him such a start. \"General Washington himself!\" he exclaimed. “He is going somewhere. I wish I knew where he is going.\" The general was not alone, for several officers and an escort of riflemen were with him, and none of these said a word to Lee when he shouldered his musket and fell into the hindmost rank as if he belonged there. All were on foot, and Lee's curiosity grew stronger 213\nand stronger as they marched on in silence away beyond the spot where he had escaped so remarkably from Captain Cary's scouting party. Then he saw the general himself take the lantern and hold it up for a moment, looking at something. \"Hullo!\" said Lee. \"They are digging like mad! They are throwing up a breastwork. It looks like a long one.\" So it did, for as the general turned and walked slowly onward, pausing now and then to speak to the men and their officers, Lee discovered that these new works were to extend along the entire front, about two miles, for the siege of Yorktown had begun in earnest and the French and American soldier laborers were constructing the first (6 parallel\" of the approaches."}

There were some who had families and refused to leave them. There were old and feeble folk and women and children, and all who were sick were compelled to keep to their unprotected beds while they waited to learn what the hands of the enemy would do for the helpless capital of the old Virginia Dominion. Governor Jefferson himself was now on horseback, dashing hither and thither at a rate which before night about killed the good animal which carried him. He succeeded in doing to the last inch whatever there was to be done, and there had been one point in his favor. For some inscrutable reason, General Arnold had made a blunder the previous day. Instead of pushing on up the river and saving every possible mile of distance before going ashore, he had landed, as Tom Evans reported, at \n\nWestover, twenty-five miles below his destination. This was on the 3d of January, and he had been able to advance only a dozen miles or so before night. He went into camp with his whole force, and, although he set out bright and early on the morning of the 4th, anything like 2\na surprise was now out of the question. The vigorous \n\nVirginia governor, standing there in the road, had but been waiting for precisely the news which Tom Evans brought him, and such things as State papers and records were already far away at Charlottesville or elsewhere. Toward night the governor took a fresh horse in place of the one he had used up, and galloped off to join his family at Tuckahoe, and to send it yet farther into the interior. The last man to whom he spoke, when he mounted his horse to go, was only a boy, after all. \"Lee Bowie,\" said the author of the Declaration,\" you are a brave fellow. I mean to be over there at Manchester, on the other side of the James, at about ten o'clock to-morrow. Get across as soon as you have learned all you can, but you may not be able to do that the first day. Wait!\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Lee. \"I'll wait and watch till \n\nI've something that's worth while, but if you don't see me again pretty soon, you may just know they've made an end of me- 99 \"Or made a prisoner of you,\" interrupted the governor, \"and that's almost as bad, sometimes. Watch and lie still! Good-by!\" He struck in his spurs at that moment and his horse sprang swiftly away. \"Spy? Spy?\" exclaimed Lee Bowie, looking after\nNO ARMY \n\n11 him. \"No, I ain't even so much as a scout. I'm only a fellow that stayed behind in Richmond because he wanted to see the British march in. I'd like to watch 'em, though, along a rifle-barrel, resting across a fence for a good aim.\" CHAPTER II  \n\n(6 THE poor fellows are worn out! I was afraid of this. Oh, how sorry I am! I wish I could do something for them. They have endured heroically.\" A tall, noble-looking man, in the buff-and-blue uniform of the Continental army, stood near a window with an open letter in his hand. He raised the letter and appeared to be reading it over slowly from end to end. Then he turned and gazed thoughtfully out of the window. It was a cold and dreary midwinter landscape. There was more snow to be seen than in the neighborhood of Richmond, but the scenery was as desolate and the trees were as leafless."}

It was somewhat in the nature of a flag of truce, and it proposed a kind of plunderer's bargain. Arnold offered to spare the town all injury if his vessels of all sorts might be permitted to come up the river unhindered, to take on board cargoes of the abundant tobacco which the marauders had found in the warehouses in and about Richmond. The offer was, of course, to be indignantly rejected. While no confidence whatever could be given to any such promise, the proposal itself informed the governor of Arnold's military weakness, and that he did not intend to attempt a permanent occupation. At the same time, he had no means of inflicting harm upon a few small craft which had already reached the Richmond wharves. The flag of truce, with its buccaneering bargain, was still on its way when Lee Bowie quietly sauntered away from Mrs. Betty Randolph's gate with a mental deter-\nmination to be guided by the old woman's caustic admonitions. While the greater part of the population had prudently decided to keep indoors, a considerable number, mostly boys of various sizes, were out for a look at the British. Neither officers nor soldiers were paying them any attention, for they were not plunder, nor was there any apparent military danger in them. It would not, however, have required a very sharp pair of eyes to have detected a difference between the manner and bearing of Lee Bowie and the others, as he went around from place to place and took swift notes of every horse and gun and soldier. There was an alertness, a keen flash of the eye, a compression of the lips, and an air of being on important business which was not at all in accord with Mrs. Randolph's instructions. Nobody had as yet spoken to him, but every inch of him betrayed the fact that he was a young patriot wishing that he had a gun with which to shoot this entire invasion of Virginia by Great Britain. 3\nCHAPTER III  \n\n\"THERE! The villains are setting the buildings on fire. They are breaking into the houses. They are plundering everywhere. It's time for me to go back to Mrs. \n\nRandolph's. I can't do any more just now.\" It was only too true. Arnold's embassy had gone and had returned, and the reply he had received had stirred up all the vindictive spirit within him. It had also appeared to tell him that the governor must have more forces at hand or shortly to arrive. It might be, therefore, that his expedition was in danger of speedy interruption, and that it would be well for him to do his remaining work quickly. It was about the middle of the afternoon and Lee Bowie had almost reached his place of intended refuge, when he suddenly felt a strong hand on his shoulder and heard a loud, angry voice commanding: \"Bring the young wolf to me. I'll see what there is in him.\" 26\nIn a moment more he was standing in front of a man of not more than medium stature, broad shouldered, strongly built, with an aquiline nose and fiercely piercing eyes. His face seemed to express a superabundance of fiery energy, pride, courage. He was just the man to have done all the daring deeds, with perhaps one sad exception of insanity, which had made up the brilliant but erratic record of General Benedict Arnold. \"Now, you young rascal, who are you? This youngster here says you are not a Richmond boy. You came from the South. Out with it!\" Hard held by a soldier who stood near the general was a little chap of not more than ten who at this moment broke in with: \"No, thir. He ith one of our men.

Hardly had they entered the room, however, and as if it were his first duty, under the circumstances, Arnold delivered to General Philips a not very large packet of papers, remarking: \"This contains the correspondence I mentioned, and some other things of varied importance. Everything about the post is in complete readiness for your own further orders.\" \"General Arnold,\" he responded with a somewhat peculiar dignity of manner, \"please go on giving your own orders for the present. I will take these papers to my room now, for I wish to compare them with others that \n\nI already have. I will see you again at the dinner-table.\" \"Certainly, general,\" exclaimed Arnold. \"I will show you your room.\" Out they went together, unattended by others, and in three minutes more Arnold returned alone, to say to the company, which now made the \"business room\" almost crowded and also noisy with all sorts of conversation: \"Gentlemen, I am compelled to repeat, after our distinguished commander, that I will see you all again at the dinner-table. That will suit you, undoubtedly, and \n\nI have also his additional instructions.\" Without another word, he stepped quickly out of the room, and they were left to their own devices, or rather to the hospitable care of his staff and of a fast-arriving swarm of the officers of the Portsmouth force. General Philips was now alone in the chamber which had been provided for him, and he was hastily examining the packet of correspondence. He was apparently under the pressure of some strong anxiety, the cause of which he did not explain aloud. General Arnold was also alone, in another room, and he was standing with his back against the mantel of its fireplace, but he was not examining anything; that is, not anything in writing or that would have been visible to anybody else. 66 \n\nIt has come!\" he said, in a low, husky tone. \"I am superseded. This is one more fruit of the jealousy that \n\nI have seen from the beginning. It is perfectly clear to me. After all I have done, they do not consider me one of themselves. They can not really distrust me, for my very life is at stake. I am the only officer in the king's forces who can not permit himself to be taken prisoner. An original Tory might be a safe prisoner of war, but I would not. And now, why am I deprived of an independent command and of an opportunity to distinguish myself and prove my loyalty? He left his place at the mantel and began to stride rapidly up and down the room. It was evident that some- \n\n---\nBURNING UP \n\n101 thing or other had stung him deeply, but it ought not to have been the mere arrival of General Philips. No rightminded military man should have felt hurt at finding himself outranked by his superior officer. Neither could the\n\nBritish army authorities be expected to regulate their appointments to duty with reference to any one man's personal ambition. Possibly, therefore, Arnold's present fit of dissatisfaction was affording a kind of pinhole through which might be seen one of the weaknesses which had led him into his awkward position. \"Superseded!\" he again exclaimed. \"Just as I had completed my plans. Oh, what could I not have done with these reenforcements! And now Philips will get the credit of whatever successes are to follow. Well, at all events, I have blistered the Virginians, and that is something. As soon as I can, I must and will have a force at my own disposal. What I mean to do is to strike New England harder than I have the Old Dominion. I want to burn out that nest of rebel privateers at New London. That would be a blow at the rebellion that it would stagger under. Then I'd like to push on up the river and burn New Haven."}

Lord Willowby told him that his partners in that scheme of cheating the jobbers had resolved to meet on the first of the new year to consider what was to be done; so that in the mean time Balfour could allow his conscience to rest, so far as the money was concerned. But in the mean time came Christmas; and he told his wife that he had no objection to joining that family party at the Hall. When he said that he had no objection, he meant that he had about twenty dozen, which he would overrule for her sake. And indeed Lady Sylvia's delight at his consent was beautiful to see. She spent day after day in decorating Willowby Hall with evergreens; she did not altogether neglect The Lilacs, but then, you see, there was to be no Christmas party there.

What, then, was this big, busy town through which we drove, with its broad thoroughfares, deep dust, green trees, and huge hotels? We looked at the jewellers' shops, and the cafés, and the promenaders, and one cries out, \"Baden-Baden !”\n\nWe catch a glimpse of some public gardens and colored lamps. and avenues, and another calls out, \"It is Kreuznach, and the band is playing!\" 1\nOUR RANCH-WOMAN. 233 \n\nWe whirl along another spacious thoroughfare, and a third calls out, \"It is the Boulevard Poissonnière !\" when it is mildly suggested that, after all, this may be no more Kreuznach than the Hudson was the Rhine, and that it might be better, on the whole, to call it Saratoga. It was with great diffidence that we ascended the steps of the monster hotel, and found ourselves in a large central hall. We were conscious that we were travel-stained, and had scarcely sufficient moral courage to ask the clerk for rooms. We knew that the smart young men standing around were regarding us; and oh! so snowy were their white neckties, which they wore in the middle of the day. And then, to make matters worse, this pernicious ranch-woman had donned in the morning a costume of lightblue serge, in which she had done some yachting the year before; and we knew, though we dared not look, that there must be stains of the salt-sea foam on it. Finally, our inward rage and humiliation were complete when, having been furnished with our keys, we entered the lift to be conveyed to the floors above; for here we found ourselves confronted by three young ladies-but the human imagination refuses to recall the splendor of the attire of these angels in human form. Each of them had a jeweller's shop on her hands. However, we dried our eyes in secret, and made as brave an appearance as possible when we assembled together in the saloon below. \"Look here, child,\" said Queen T— to our ranch-woman, as she lifted a white object from the table. \"Do you see that? That is a fork.

It was all we could get out of her. Then we went out for a drive; and a mighty fine show we made, with our green gauze curtains to keep out the dust, and with our two horses. The lieutenant was perched up beside the driver. Occasionally he disappeared from our sight altogether, hidden away by the dense clouds of brown dust that came rolling in the wake of some carriage. And the farther we went out into the country, the deeper the dust in the roads appeared to become, until our German friend had assumed the guise of a baker, and\nthere was scarcely any difference between the color of his hat, his beard, and his coat."}

It was a song of love he sung-of love and youth and the delight of summer nights: how could they but stand still to hear? A LIFE-PLEDGE. 43 \n\nCHAPTER VI. A LIFE-PLEDGE. LORD WILLOWBY had fallen asleep. Through the white curtains of the window they could see him lying back in an easychair, a newspaper dropped on his knee. Why should they go in to wake him? The wan light was dying away from the bosom of the lake down there, and there was less of a glow in the northern skies; but the stars were burning more clearly now-white and throbbing over the black foliage of the elms. The nightingale sung from time to time, and the woods were silent to hear. Now and again a cool breeze came through the bushes, bringing with it a scent of lilacs and sweetbrier. They were in no hurry to re-enter the house. Balfour was talking a little more honestly and earnestly now; for he had begun to speak of his work, his aims, his hopes, his difficulties. It was not a romantic tale he had to tell on this beautiful night, but his companion conferred romance upon it. He was talking as an eager, busy, practical politician; she believed she was listening to a great statesman, to a leader of the future, to her country's one and only savior. It was of no use that he insisted on the prosaic and commonplace nature of the actual work he had to do. \"You see, Lady Sylvia,\" he said, \"I am only an apprentice as yet. I am only learning how to use my tools. And the fact is, there is not one man in fifty in the House who fancies that any tools are necessary. Look how on the most familiar subjectsthose nearest to their own doors—they are content to take all their information from the newspapers. They never think of inquiring, of seeing, for themselves. They work out legislation as a mere theorem; they have no idea how it is practically applied. They pass Adulteration Acts, Sanitary Acts, Lodging-house Acts; they consider Gas Bills, Water Bills, and what not; but it is all done in the air. They don't know. Now I have been trying to\ncram on some of these things, but I have avoided official reports. I know the pull it will give me to have actual and personal experience—this is in one direction only, you see-of the way the poorer people in a great town live: how taxation affects them, how the hospitals treat them, their relations with the police, and a hundred other things. Shall I tell you a secret, Lady Sylvia?\" These were pretty secrets to be told on this beautiful evening! secrets not of lovers' dreams and hopes, but secrets about Gas \n\nBills and Water Bills. \"I lived for a week in a court in Seven Dials, as a French polisher. Next week I am going to spend in a worse den—a haunt of thieves, tramps, and hawkers; a very pretty den, indeed, to be the property of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and almost under the shadow of Westminster Abbey !\" She uttered a slight exclamation-of deprecation and anxious fear. But he did not quite understand. \"This time, however,\" he continued, \"I shall be not so badly. off; for I am going to live at a common lodging-house, and there the beds are pretty clean. I have been down and through the whole neighborhood, and have laid my plans."}

She can make a newspaper editor fancy himself a duke. By-the-way, I see the prince has taken to the newspapers lately; they are all represented at his garden parties. If you have a clever wife, it is wonderful what she can do for you.\" 66 \n\nAnd if you have a stupid wife, can you do anything for her?\" inquired Mr. Jewsbury, to whom all this business-this theatrical \"business\" of public life—was rather unintelligible. Balfour burst out laughing. \"What would you think of a cabinet minister being led by the nose what would you think of his resigning the whole of his authority into the hands of the permanent secretary under him-simply because that secretary undertakes the duty of getting the minister's wife, who is not very presentable, included in invitations, and passed into houses where she would never otherwise be seen? She is a wonderful woman, that woman. They call her Mrs. Malaprop. But Tommy Bingham gets her taken about somehow.\" The two friends smoked in silence for some time; the Irish \n\nUniversities, the High Court of Judicature, the Endowment of Research, may perhaps have been occupying their attention. But when Balfour spoke next, he said, slowly, \"It must be a good thing for a man to have a woman beside him whose very presence will make the world sweet and wholesome to him. If it were not for a woman here or there-and it is only by accident they reveal themselves to you-what could one think of human nature?\" \"And when are you to see this wonderful rose that is able to sweeten all the winds of the world?\" his friend asked, with a smile. \"I am going down with Lord Willowby on Monday for a few days.

It was late when they arrived at Mainz, and there was some little delay about getting supper ready, because, a quarter of an hour after it was ordered, they heard the squealing of a young cock outside, that being the animal destined for their repast. Moreover, when the fowl appeared, he turned out to be a tough little beast, only half cooked; so they sent him away, and had something else.

That business of refurnishing the house in Piccadilly had been done perforce; it was with a far greater satisfaction that she set about decorating and preparing a spacious cottage, called The Lilacs, which was set in the midst of a pretty garden, some three miles from Willowby Park. Here, indeed, was pleasant work for her, and to her was intrusted the whole management of the thing, in Balfour's necessary absence in town. From day to day she rode over to see how the workmen were getting on. She sent up business-like reports to London. And at last she gently hinted that he might come down to see what had been done. \"Will you ride over or drive?\" said Lord Willowby to his guest, after breakfast that morning. \"I am sure Mr. Balfour would rather walk, papa,\" said Lady Sylvia, \"for I have discovered a whole series of short-cuts that I want to show him—across the fields.

But if you walk over, you must send Lock to the cottage with the horses, and ride back.\" Although they were profoundly disappointed that Lord Willowby could not accompany them, they set out on their walk with an assumed cheerfulness which seemed to conceal their inward grief. It was July now; but the morning was fresh and cool after the night's rain, and there was a pleasant southerly breeze blowing the fleecy clouds across the blue sky, so that there was an abundance of light, motion, and color all around them. The elms were rustling and swaying in the park; the rooks were cawing; in the distance they saw a cloud of yellow smoke arise from the road as the fresh breeze blew across. She led him away by secret paths and wooded lanes, with here and there a stile to cross, and here and there a swinging gate to open. She was anxious he should know intimately all the surroundings of his future home, and she seemed to be familiar with the name of every farm-house, every turnpike, every clump of trees, in the neighborhood. She knew the various plants in the hedges, and he professed himself profoundly interested in learning their names. They crossed a bit of common now; he had never known before how beautiful the flowers of a common were -the pale lemon-colored hawk-weed, the purple thyme, the orange and crimson tipped bird's-foot trefoil. They passed through waving fields of rye; he had never noticed before the curious sheen of gray produced by the wind on those billows of green. They came in sight of long undulations of wheat; he ved he had never seen in his life anything so beautiful as the brilliant scarlet of the poppies where the corn was scant. The happiness in Lady Sylvia's face, when he expressed himself delighted with all these things, was something to sec. They came upon a gypsy encampment, apparently deserted by all but the women and children. One of the younger women immediately came out and began the usual patter. Would not the pretty lady have her fortune told? She had many happy days in store for her, but she had a little temper of her own, and so forth. Lady Sylvia stood irresolute, bashful, rather inclined to submit to the ordeal for the amusement of the thing, and looking doubtfully at her companion as to whether he would approve. As for Balfour, he did not pay the slightest heed to the poor woman's jargon. His eye had been wandering over the encampment, apparently examining everything. And then he turned to the woman, and began to question her with a directness that startled her out of her trade manner altogether."}

He effected his purpose in a short time; and that is all that need here be said of him.

His very clothes were hanging up there, in a ghastly row, each article numbered off as a lot. In the room in which he had but recently died, a fine, tall, fresh-colored farmer-dressed for the occasion in broadcloth-was discussing with his wife what price the bedstead would probably fetch. And there was a bar, with sherry and sandwiches. And on the lawn outside the auctioneer had put up his tent; and the flag erected over the tent was of the gayest colors. Lord Willowby and Balfour strolled through these rooms, both forbearing to say what they thought of all this tawdry magnificence-panellings of blue silk and silver, with a carpet of pink roses on a green ground; candelabra, costing £1800, the auctioneer's reserve price on which was £300; improvised ancestors, at a guinea a head, looking out of gorgeous frames; and so forth, and so forth. They glanced at the catalogue occasionally. It was an imposing volume; and the descriptions of the contents of the house were almost poetical. \"Look at the wines,\" said Lord Willowby, with a compassionate smile. \"The claret is nearly all Lafitte. I suppose those toadies of his have supplied him with a vin ordinaire at 120 shillings a dozen.\" \"I should not be surprised if a lot of these spurious things sold for more than he gave for them,\" Balfour said. \"You will find people imagining everything to be fine because a rich man bought it. That claret would fetch a high price, depend on it, if it was all labelled 'Château Wandsworth.' 999 Then there was the ringing of a bell; and the people began to stream out of the house into the marquee; and the auctioneer had an improvised rostrum put up for himself at the end of the long table; and then the bare-armed men began to carry out the various articles to be bid for. It was soon very evident that prices were running high. No doubt the farmers about would be proud to show to their friends a despatch-box, a bird-cage, a hall table-anything that had belonged to the owner of The Hollow. And so the ostentatious trash, that even Tottenham Court \n\nRoad would have been ashamed of, was carried piecemeal out into the light of the day; and in some instances these simple folk considered it to be so beautiful that a murmur of admira-\ntion ran round the tent when the things were brought in. It was altogether a melancholy sight. Balfour had accompanied Lord Willowby solely from the fact of his having an idle forenoon to dispose of; but he could not quite make out what his father-in-law's purpose was in coming here. For one thing, he appeared to be quite indifferent about the sale itself. He had listened to one or two of the biddings; and then-saying that the prices were ridiculously high-had proposed a farther stroll through the rooms. So they entered the house again, and had another look at the old masters (dating from the latter half of the nineteenth century) and at the trumpery gilt and satin. 66 \"Ah, well, Balfour,\" said Lord Willowby, with a pensive air, one can almost pity that poor fellow, having his house overhauled by strangers in this way.

A thunder-bolt seemed to have fallen. Mrs. Chorley rose. \"I, at least,\" said she, in majestic accents, and with an indescribable calm, \"will not interfere in this election. Gentlemen, good-morning. Eugenius, the chaise is at the door.\" With that she walked in a stately manner out of the room, leaving the burden of the situation on her unfortunate husband. He looked rather bewildered; but nevertheless he felt bound to assert the dignity of the family. \"I must say, Mr. Balfour,\" said he, rather nervously, \"that your language is-is unusual. Mrs. Chorley only asked for—for an expression of regret an apology which was only our due after the remarks of-of Lady Sylvia.\" By this time Balfour had got on his feet, and taken his hat in his hand. All the Celtic blood in his veins was on fire. 66 \"An apology!\" he said. 'Why, man, you must be mad! I tell you that every word my wife said was absolutely true. Do you expect her to send you a humble letter, begging for your forgiveness? I apologized for her hastiness at the time; I am sorry I did. For what she said then, I say now-that it is quite mon-\nAT A CERTAIN CLUB, 145 strous you should suddenly propose to use your influence in the borough on behalf of a man who was an absolute stranger to you; and if you imagined that I was going to bribe you by buying that waste land, or going to bribe the borough by giving them a public green, then get that notion out of your head as soon as possible. Good-morning, Mr. Chorley. Pray tell Mrs. Chorley that I am very sorry if I have hurt her feelings; but pray tell her too that my wife is not conscious of having said anything that demands an apology.\" And so this mad young man and his companion went out, and walked down the main street of Englebury in the pleasant sunshine. And it was all in vain that Mr. Bolitho tried to put in his piteous prayers and remonstrances. The borough? He would see the borough sink into the bottomless pit before he would allow his wife to apologize for a speech that did her infinite honor! The election? He would fight the place if there were ten thousand Chorleys arrayed against him! \"I tell you you have gone stark staring mad,\" said the despairing Mr. Bolitho. \"Chorley will immediately go over to \n\nHarnden-you will see. His wife will goad him to it. And how can you think of contesting the seat against Harnden and \n\nChorley combined?\" Nature had not conferred a firm jaw on Mr. Hugh Balfour for nothing. \"I tell you, in turn,\" said the young man, who was neither to hold nor to bind, simply because something had been said about his wife-\"I tell you, in turn, that I mean to contest the seat all the same; and, what is more, by the Lord Harry, I mean to win it!\" CHAPTER XX. AT A CERTAIN CLUB. \"BOLITHO,\" said Mr. Hugh Balfour, as the two companions were preparing to leave for the London train, “when you see my wife, don't say anything to her about this affair. She would only be annoyed to think that she was in any way connected\nwith such a wretched wrangle. Women are better out of these things.\" Now, Mr. Bolitho was somewhat vexed. The guiding principle in life of this bland, elderly, easy-going gentleman was to make friends everywhere, or, at least, acquaintances, so that you could scarcely have mentioned to him a borough in England in which he did not know, more or less slightly, some man of influence. And here he had been involved in a quarrel—all because of the impetuous temper of this foolish young man — - with the ruling politician of Englebury! “I don't think,\" said he, with a wry smile, \"that I am likely to see Lady Sylvia.\" : \"What do you mean?\" Balfour asked, as they set out to walk to the station."}

But when Lady Sylvia went on to explain, with increasing hesitation, that herself and her husband would be expected to be of this Christmas gathering, Mr. Balfour mentally made use of a phrase which was highly improper. She did not hear it, of course. They drove up to the Hall in silence; and when they got into the house, Balfour shook hands with Major \n\nBlythe with all apparent good-nature. Lord Willowby had wished the stranger to follow him into the library. In a few moments he returned to the drawingroom.

He said nothing. Lady Sylvia turned to her two relatives. Now, had Lord Willowby been going over to The Lilacs, his brother might have ventured to accompany him; but Major Blythe scarcely liked the notion of thrusting his head into that lion's den all by himself. \"My dear,\" said the doughty warrior to his wife, \"I think we will leave the young folks to themselves for to-day-if they will kindly excuse us.

Not a moment is left the child for a farewell talk with her father, between watching Ch-one and the excitement arising from the discovery of the witch's disappearance. For when the tide had bared the place of her stake to reveal, not the stark body of the miserable witch, but the idle, water-curled thongs washed about the stake, almost a panic seized the villagers, and increased manifold the dark forebodings of Ka-kee regarding his son. \"Ch-one would die,\" he thought; \"the power of the witch had been beyond their reckoning; she had, by the might of her demon, broken her bonds and become invisible; no doubt she had taken wings and had hovered over them, brooding evil while they slept!\" Not one of all the village, save the poor witch Shahehe, connected Kotch-kul-ah's absence with that of the slave woman. The children were off for all day, and until they returned it would not be known that neither Kotchkul-ah nor the canoe was with them. Excitement thus centred in the disappearance of the witch. As the day advances and the wind proves favorable, the men become anxious to get on their way by the afternoon tide; but before it can be thought safe to launch a boat great fires must be made on the beach, and around them the people must dance with incantations, and cast into the devouring flames offerings of various kinds. This done, all is hurry and rush to get on the tide at its flood. The packs of furs and bundles of dried salmon, blankets, and extra clothing of native-dressed leather are stowed in the bottom of the large canoe. Twelve fine specimens of the Chilkat tribe take their places, with paddles in hand, ready for their leader's signal, while the \n\nA Valk. boat is held from the willing waves by the arms of stalwart friends, who, at the signal, will push her off. The leader-and in this case he is also helmsman-is Kah-sha, who stands erect in his place, with a keen eye surveying the preparations and directing a little rearrangement of hastily placed baggage, making it more compact and at the same time trimming the little craft more perfectly. Two square sheets and the poles for their support are also placed where their raising will be the work of a moment when they pass out of the shelter of the bay into the breeze which is sweeping down the channel. These last arrangements are all but completed, when Kah-sha's attention is suddenly arrested by the appearance of Yealh-neddy, knife in hand, running toward the boat from the direction of Sha-hehe's place of torture. The knife is replaced in its sheath at his belt as he runs, and snatching a bundle from his mother, who has stood silently awaiting him, he dashes into the water, tosses his luggage into the canoe, and with a light spring takes a place near Kah-sha himself. The whole thing has occurred in a moment, and not one of the traders but is taken by surprise. \"I have cut the thongs from Sha-hehe,\" he calls out loudly, above the noise of the water and the expressions of astonishment. \"Cover her and heal her, old woman, against the time I come again. I shall want her then.\" Even before the last words are uttered the signal has been given and the boat is off, the rhythmic paddles moving as by perfect mechanism to the measure of their boatsong. Very soon the sails are hoisted and are caught by the fresh north wind, bearing the little bark rapidly from the sight of those on the shore, who sing them farewell and good fortune.

The meeting between herself and her mother is wordless and without demonstration of feeling of any sort. She learns that a canoe has but a few hours ago arrived from Sitka to trade for oil, and that they wish to return by the first tide to-morrow if the wind is fair. Arrangements are soon made by which Kotch-kul-ah is to accompany them. As the evening draws on Kotch-kui-ah sits, lonely and apart, in the great house, almost too numb to fear anything or to realize her distresses, except that just whichever way she turns there is darkness and suffering and a\nhopeless dragging of life. Her baby has fallen asleep in her arms. She has him, but what shall she do with him? That is as dark as all the rest. Sitting thus in the gloom she does not notice the slow, silent approach of a woman—a woman younger than herself-does not notice until the woman has come very near and sits looking with shy and kindly eyes up into her own, so heavy and sad. She has not even noticed the eyes until touched gently by the woman's small, smooth hand. Younger, and she is smaller than Kotch-kul-ah. Her dress is a print of delicate pattern and of the nicest workmanship. Everything about her betokens a gentle and refined spirit. The face is not so handsome as Kotchkul-ah's own, but it is round and smooth and has a healthy color. It has, withal, an expression of truth and strength and simple sincerity, such as wins you as soon as the trusting eyes have looked into yours; and then, when the mouth has smiled, you know that you could not distrust the indwelling soul of that woman, with the world's evidence against it. Kotch-kul-ah sits and gazes at her until she has felt all this, and feels not so sure that somewhere there may not be a little light. Then-- \"You are Tashekah?\" \"Ah!\" with a shy dropping of the eyes. \"Why did you come here?\" Without a word the little brown hands take from under her blanket a small basket of fresh, white herring eggsan early spring delicacy-and a curiously-carved bone dish of the pure, white oulacharr oil, and set them before Kotch-kul-ah. \"You have eaten nothing; you cannot have a strong heart,\" she says. \"What is that to-any one?\" the weary Kotch-kul-ah\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nasks, her heart touched enough to make her lips ungracious. An instant's silence, with a pained, questioning look in the child-like face, then: \"You are cold,\" the gentle voice says. \"Wait: I have tea that my father got at Fort Simpson. I will bring you some; it will do you good,\" and she has gone. Kotch-kul-ah lays her sleeping babe down against the wall beside her, and covering her face on her knees, sits so until aroused again by the same peculiar touch. There is Tashekah low at her side, with a bowl of steaming, fragrant tea. \"Drink it, dear!\" Taking the bowl into her own hands, Kotch-kul-ah drinks it eagerly. Then, handing back the cup, she says: \"It is good; it is like you!\" With a look of gladness Tashekah is about to go, when Kotch-kul-ah catches at her dress. \"Wait! Give me your hand!\" And taking one from a number of silver bracelets on her own arm she fastens it on the slender wrist of Tashekah. \"You will never see me again, but you will think of me many times; and I-I will not forget you. Be happy! Tashekah looks in tender wonder, while Kotch-kul-ah, with a passionate gesture, covers her head and creeps closer to her baby. Then, taking up her bowl, the childwoman goes silently back to her little corner in the house of Ka-kee, where soon she is wrapped in dreams of peace; nor knows when, a few hours later, the storm-tossed Kotch-kul-ah sets sail with the trading people for Sitka.

With even more frantic and horrible gyrations than those he had used over the dying chief, but occupying much less time, his incantation is ended and the swooncollapse has succeeded. Where all has been tempest and uproar the silence of the dead now reigns, but it is a silence tense with expectancy. The spirit of the sorcerer returns. Amid the shiverings of his body the voice comes in those far-away, sepulchral tones which always inspire the people with awe and terror. \"I have found the demon-there!\" And springing to his feet, his long, bony finger is thrust out toward a middle-aged woman near the door. His body bends rigidly toward her; his eyes seem to cauterize her every nerve of motion; a deathly pallor overspreads her face; her eyes are distended in horror; but she neither moves nor speaks. \"Take her!\" he cries. \"That demon will not burnonly drowning can destroy her power.\" It is not now a difficult matter to make way through the crowd. Strong men have seized the woman and drag her out of the doorway. The tide is far out. A heavy stake is soon driven securely into the hard beach, a little more than half-way out, where the returning tide, wave by wave, will rise far above the head of the victim. The unfortunate witch has been found harboring the evil spirit that caused the disaster. And here she is lashed to her stake as Shahehe was to hers. Having made the witch thus secure to her fate, the slow, sure coming of which will prove her torture, the excitement of the outsiders abates to such an extent that, weary as all the feasters are, they gladly seek refuge from the storm within the sheltering homes of the village. As one dead still lies little Ch-one, save that now and then a short sigh escapes his white lips. Grimly his father sits watching the child, while the mother, sobbing, crouches over the precious body. Now she puts back his damp hair and covers his brow with kisses, calling over all the pet names she ever gave him. Tashekah in tender sympathy drops silent tears over the sleeping babe in her lap, and dozes from utter exhaustion. Wise and kindly Kah-sha remains, and a few other friends; while the multitude have gone to their homes or\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nAlready rolled themselves up in their blankets here. the air is resonant with the signs of heavy sleep. The little horn dishes of tallow with their twisted wicks have long ago burned out, but Kah-sha has found material to replenish one, and it burns near the sorrowing group. \"I would make his blood run, Ka-kee,\" Kah-sha says, while fingering gently but intelligently the child's head. \"That was a heavy blow. The head bone pushes in. The blood is thick and will spoil in there-better set it moving.\" \"See, Kah-sha,\" Ka-kee answers in an unusual voice, extending his weak and trembling hand. \"Is that ready to do such work? If the wind falls before morning he will live.\" \"I can do it,\" says Kah-sha, not noticing the last remark. \"See my hand!\" And as he speaks he holds out his firm and well-shaped hand, with a small, sharp knife in its grasp. \"Do it, then, if you like,\" groans the father; and with a skilful turn of the instrument the deed is done. A little gentle friction over the surface, a chafing of the hands and feet, and, drop by drop, the slow blood begins to flow from the newly opened wound. A little more, and a small stream of the bright fluid is discharged. Circulation is further stimulated, and wet cloths are bound about the child's head. His breathing grows more natural, and the color begins to return to the lips. Sleep overpowers the weary watchers, heavy with sorrow. The tallow lamp burns out. The village sleeps."}

IIO \n\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nCHAPTER X. PURPOSES NOT CROSSED. CLEAR 'LEAR and beautiful dawns the morning, but the village of Yhin-da-stachy sleeps long. The tide has well run out again before any one of those who were to have started this morning for Fort Simpson has awakened; and when at last they do arouse, it is with a heaviness of sense that urges no haste. There is a rubbing of eyes, a stretching of limbs, a turning over on the back, a drawing up of the knees, a folding of the arms under the head, and a delicious sense of rest with time for rest. The patient children have long ago finished their sleep, and taking what they wanted of the ever-ready dried salmon, have without ado betaken themselves to the field, wild with joy over the ripening of the first berries. It is long before Kotch-kul-ah's absence is even noticed, and when it does become known there is only a lazy conclusion that she has gone roaming with the children, and no further thought is given her. Ch-one has aroused once or twice, speaking a word or two in an intelligible way, taking water in little, slow sips, then dropping off again into what seems almost too still a thing for sleep. His mother has carried him home in her own arms, leaving Tashekah to follow with the baby. Once more Ch-one has aroused with his new friend's name on his lips and an appeal in his dull eyes. Tashekah leaves the baby asleep, swinging in his leather ham-\nIII mock; and as she bends over the little sufferer and takes his hand in her own a look of pleased satisfaction comes into his face, and the little hand flutters feebly; then the tired eyes half-close again, and he seems to know nothing more-only, when Tashekah, over-weary, withdraws her hand to move about, the little one shows signs of unrest. \"Leave him not, Tashekah!\" the mother, Sa-allie, pleads, thinking of more than the present; \"he loves you, and you give him rest.” \"I love the child-man, too,\" Tashekah answers; \"but my father goes south to-day, you know, and my brother will take me to my grandmother to-morrow.\" \"Then Ch-one must die! See how he rests when you are near him, and the quiet heals his hurt. If you go away, his spirit and his blood will make fire enough to take his life. You do not want him to die?\" \"Oh, no, no! He loves me. He must not die! Surely the great medicine-spirit will help him. I will do what I can; but my father may want me to go and my brother may not like to have me stay.\" \"We will see to that. Your father is wise and good; he will know what is best, and he will not deny us this help,\" is Sa-allie's confident reply. Ka-kee lies curled up on the floor near his little son, still anxious, still depressed.

It was \n\nChan-ka, nephew of Yealh-neddy, that was with him; and Yealh-neddy at this moment is lying within his wife's house, heavy with drunken sleep, a result of last night's feast, for which he had provided several boxes of hoots-anoo of his own manufacture.

There is no death so held in terror by the Kling-gets as that by drowning-doomed as they believe such a soul is to eternal wandering in cold and pain, ever and vainly seeking rest. The shrieks and the groans of the women are heard high above the thundering of the waters, which are dashing and breaking on the shore. Some of the men have gone to look at the boat. As they turn over its ruined, broken hull they find the sailsticks wedged into it and the sail curiously wrapped and caught between them. Stop! There is something within. Can it be one of the logs? With haste they disentangle it, and-their shout is only unheard by the mourners because of their own shriller noises! But they are silenced when the men have taken up the body and start across to one of the dwellings. It is indeed Chan-ka! And now great is the regret that \n\nKa-kee is not at home. The medicine-man has gone to \n\nChilkoot, and there is nothing for it but to do, without the medicine-spirit, what they can to restore the breath of the drowned boy. Such women as Usha-shawet are speedily at work, and before Kin-da-shon and his party have refreshed themselves with food and made dry their clothing by the hospitable village fires, the boy is breathing and conscious, causing great talk and rejoicing among the people. Kunz has restored himself to his household, of which, in his father's absence, he has felt himself the guardian and provider.

The eyes, however, are unnaturally large and bright, with a world of woe and appeal in them.

She has not far to go before she hears the laughter\nand merry talk of the entire party coming from the woods. Her fears set at rest, Sa-allie turns and walks on with them for some distance before it occurs to her that if Kotch-kul-ah had gone with the children the returning party is not complete.

Not many hours have passed before it is asserted and believed that during the night the witch was seen to rise up out of the water and fly over to the dead-houses, from which she presently emerged, hovered over the house of the dead chief's widow, and, by demoniacal power, brought to her arms from the room below the helpless Kotch-kul-ah, whereupon she caused the canoe to rise,\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\npass under, and convey them as on wings over the dark waters, where they eventually disappeared, as a raven, to the opposite distant shore. Nothing is done toward sending out parties in search until next morning. Then the country between the villages is pretty thoroughly scoured, and the villages themselves soon set agog by the new excitement. Kasko thus finds himself in the company of the search party going to Chilkoot. Having crossed the portage, the party divides, one half going by land, the other by water—the former making an examination of every deadhouse on the route. To insure their own safety they carry a stout rope of sinew, which is to be made fast about the waist of the man who ventures in to examine the boxes of bones and ashes, the other end being held with a strong grasp by the remainder of the party, who stand ready to drag him back if any haunting spirit should prove too powerful for him. Those who go by water, with the same precaution visit the caves along the shore where the unburned bodies of medicine-men have been laid from time to time through many generations. As these are places peculiarly attractive to spirits of many kinds, every one who is obliged to approach or pass them resorts to means which, it is hoped, will divert the attention of such demons as are disposed to attack the intruders, and appease their anger also. So as the canoe glides near the sacred and unholy places, eagle's down is blown about through the air on every side by the men, chanting at the same time strange words of invocation. As they proceed bits of tobacco and other delicacies are tossed into the water."}

USHA-SHAWET, KOTCH-KUL-AH, AND KIN-DA-SHON. IN N escaping from Yhin-da-stachy Kotch-kul-ah was guided by the experience and natural sagacity of her companion. For many years Usha had been accustomed to moving about the country as a trusted slave, getting in supplies of berries and such herbs and barks as were constantly in requisition for medicinal purposes, for tanning and for coloring the grasses also and the bark-lining needed for basket-making. Knowing the country so well, and being versed in the art of living under such conditions as attended independent out-door life, she was well able to direct their course to a place of hiding which would be both secure and comfortable, at least for a time. Crossing the wide channel at once, they followed the shore north for some distance, until, striking a small sandbank, which even the high tides did not always cover and which now lay quite exposed, they disembarked. Making a small pack for Kotch-kul-ah, including only her own blanket and the paddles, with a small bundle of dried fish, Usha gathered what remained of their baggage into a large and compact bundle and hid it in the heavy undergrowth on the shore. Then taking up the canoe, overturned on her head and shoulders, herself scarcely visible as she moved along, she led the way over the hard, smooth sand. After a long tramp they came to a softly flowing mountain stream which had no visible outlet-its waters sinking into the gravelly\nshore and disappearing altogether far above the bed of the river. Hiding the canoe in the bushes and finding a comfortable retreat for themselves, they rested and ate their fish. After such refreshment Usha went back for her pack, and with it safely returned to Kotch-kul-ah and led the way up along the course of the stream, till, about half-way to the mountain's top, they came to a lovely little lake, where the spotted trout were leaping in the sunlight like truant beams of stronger growth. Here, on the lake's sweetly wooded shore, these homeless women found rest and peace and strength as full as the natural world can give it. To this spot Usha brought the canoe, and during their summer's tarrying much improved it by sewing up its cracks with twine of bark, lining and stuffing them with fine moss and melted gum. They repaired the booth of hemlock boughs which Usha had made and used long before, and within they made them fresh beds of the same fragrant material. For Kotch-kul-ah it was precisely the sort of life needed for the counteracting of such pestilential poisons as her two-years' confinement had engendered. When, after three months, Usha brought her out again to seek a winter dwelling-place among the sheltering rocks of the eastern shore, it would have been hard to recognize the high class of the girl by her complexion. All the angles of face and figure had disappeared, charming curves of girlish beauty had taken their place. The contracted chest and stooping shoulders were transformed; the step was elastic and free as a deer's; the eyes were full and bright and the complexion dark and ruddy."}

The sky was black-not a star was visible; the air itself seemed peopled with creatures of the dark. 'Twas such a night as causes one involuntarily to drag the foot and put out the hand, to shut the eyes on what we cannot see, that the inner sight may the more keenly perceive what lies about us. A little to one side, and back of the big house, Shahehe's stake had been fixed. By reason of the excitement attendant on the sacrifice of the slaves, and afterward the gathering of the mourners to cry dry the river through which they would have their chief pass dry-shod, the\nyoung witch had been left almost unnoticed, and, for a time, unnoticing. The weird chant, the wild wailing of the women, had entered into her benumbed, unreasoning mind; its chorus of indescribable sound seemed to rise from source unfathomable and to echo through eternity the cries of an endless wandering. Her stupor became heavier. Nature was kinder than her children; and while the poor body bled from their torture, she closed its windows and its doors for a time and took the spirit roving. There were bright green fields before her now; flowers of unearthly brightness bloomed all about her; waters fell in sweetest freshness and their music mingled with the song of birds. She danced along with the lightness of a sunbeam, and glanced through vapors of fragrance. Was this life-or was this death? Suddenly a shadow of intense blackness crossed her beautiful sky. The bird's song became a croak, the flowers were changed to toads, the zephyrs with which she played became the flapping of a raven's wing. Now the evil bird was at her side, it pecked the flesh from her hands and feet; now it lighted on her shoulder with its horrid, croaking laugh; and now-it wears the face of \n\nYealh-neddy! In a moment more he has buried his beak in her brain. She struggles, but her hands and her feet are bound with burning bands—she cannot move. In breathless agony she awakes!

He glanced at her. With downcast eyes, she sat by her mother twisting a ring round the third finger of her left hand. So!

That's the very way the girl came to capture him; an' that's the very way he left these parts and went off on his travels to Dublin. But sure ye know; an' now come away out, Frank, till I show ye the fields. Get the tay, Sarah; an' call us when it's ready.\" Frank followed John through the garden, out into the lane, and thence uphill till they came to a circular mound towards which from all sides the island sloped up from the water. This was the highest point of Inishrath; and standing there, Frank had full sight of it all, and of the lake stretching away from its stony shores. In shape it was nearly circular. Round its edge, here and there, were trees. Hedges ran down and across it, and from ditch to ditch lay the bare ribs of the little fields. The soil showed cold and hungry through its covering of stones and coarse grass. Here, two goats were hobbling along, there, a donkey stood forlorn among the whins, in and out of the rush clumps ran scrags of fowls. Half way down, stood the Butlers' home-tumble-down offices behind, garden in front, the pier and cots below. The wind came shrill and keen; the sky hung low; bleak and barren, Inishrath lay scowling in the waste of grey waters. John stretched an arm and swept it around. \"There,\" said he; \"there's me estate.\" THE BARRYS. Frank looked right and left, here and there. Yes, thought he; and an estate to be proud of. 66 \"The whole island, then, belongs to you, John?\" \"Such as it is, I own it all-for a consideration in the shape of rent,\" added John, with a grin. Frank nodded. \"And yours is the only house upon it, I see?\" \"That's all. One house an' one estate, an' all me own.\" Again Frank nodded."}

Within ten minutes he had affirmed that free-trade was ruining England; that popular education was a mistake; that coals were absurdly dear, and that baldness was hereditary in the Dent family. His opinions were antiquated. He believed in the past, the good old days of his youth, the time when apples were six a penny, and Dulwich was a garden of Eden, and boys were boys, and girls girls, and neither spoilt by the Board Schools. Mentally he had not budged for forty years; in knowledge and experience he was a young man grown old, a fossil embedded in the dear hills of long ago. In literature he admired Dickens, Shakespeare (whom he never read), and the evening paper. In art he was fond of battle-pieces, studies in the pathetic, colour broad and garish. Give him music that set his heels drumming, ballads that wailed and snivelled, and he was happy. He was easily pleased; fond of his home; unselfish, good-tempered; and for the rest, spoke never an evil word of anyone. In all his life, by word or deed, he had never wronged a soul. His record was clean before God and man. Yet, in face of these benevolences, perhaps indeed because of them, there at sixty-five stood Richard Dent, still at the foot of the ladder, his face turned hopefully upwards, ever striving, ever failing, doomed for aye to see others climbing and himself left trampling the dust, a commercial drudge, a stranded, grey-headed junior.

Come, Nan, me girl; come away, Sarah. Ye'll forgive us runnin' off, Frank, me son? But the poor must earn their bread be the sweat o' their brow. Ay, ay.\" So the feast broke up. All hurried down to the pier; there manned the big ferry cot and, Nan and \n\nFrank at one oar, Sarah at the other, John standing by the steering sweep, set her course for the Lis-\nTHE BARRYS. mahee side. The night began to fall; the waters lapped against the cot and splashed musically at dip of the oars; but, all the way from Inishrath to the \n\nLismahee side and thence (the cot now full of noisy marketers, some tipsy, some sober, many striking the golden mean) to Garvagh, the only music that sounded for Frank Barry was the soft witchery of Nan's voice, and the only night that fell flashed from Nan's dark eyes; nor did he once, all the way, call to mind the eyes and voice of his dear Maid \n\nMarian. Ah, Frank Barry! Then the cot swung to the pier; out poured the marketers with shout and clamour. Soon Frank was standing in shade of the willows, and Nan was gone, and John's voice was ringing out across the dark waters: \"Good night, Mr. Frank. Safe home; an' come again soon.\" 1\nCHAPTER V. \n\nTwo nights went; it was only the afternoon of \n\nMonday, yet once again was Frank Barry feeling somewhat restive. He felt inclined to mope, to grumble. The days were long, the nights weary; life, he felt, ran tamely within the precincts of Ryfield. It seemed quite a week, for instance, since Saturday and his visit to Inishrath; it seemed eighteen hours rather than eight since the coming of Marian's letter by that morning's post. Not that he was pining to get back to Inishrath. Oh, no. Not that Marian's letter had brought depression or loneliness. Oh, no, indeed. Nevertheless, time did seem to hang on his hands; he did feel bored and weary. How was it? Was his environment to be blamed; that, or himself? His environment surely. Think of the last two days. Think of Sunday; its late breakfast, its weary drive through the fields and bogs to the dreary church with its box-pews, harmonium, drawling choir, prosy sermon."}

He flung back his chair, fell to pacing up and down, hands writhing behind him, chin on his breast. It was infernal, he kept repeating to himself. He had so much to do; time was pressing hard.

CHAPTER VI. To Frank Barry it was pleasant relief, that quick stepping from the stuffy hall into the light and freshness even of East Street. There was a snap in the air, a bracing coolness, as of the sea in summer time. He felt exhilarated, well satisfied; he drew a long breath, lighted a cigarette, and, standing by the curb, looked up at the sky. It was full of stars; as his eyes found them, Frank told himself that he had managed Sarah well. Ah, but she was deep! But not deep enough. Frank Barry saw through her little scheme. Right glad she would be for Mr. \n\nFrank to come visiting-when John was at home. Very anxious she was now for Nan to see Mr. Frank. Nan? Why had she refused? Was it because of the old days, the old happenings? What was she doing, thinking, even then? Turning, he looked up-back went Sarah's face from one window; a corner of the blind dropped behind the other; below, the barearmed landlady shrank quickly into the gloom of her shop. It was time to move, Frank thought. He took to the roadway, and set out for home. The street was now all bustle and glare, the pavements thronged, the air quick with clamour.

Somehow, he felt nervous, apprehensive. Beneath the hall lamp, he stopped and pulled out his watch. Past nine o'clock; nearly supper-time. A woman; a nameless woman? Slowly he walked to the dining-room door; there stopped again, with his 237\nTHE BARRYS. hand on the knob; then quickly turned the handle and went in. The gas was turned high; the table laid for supper. Facing the door a small fire burnt brightly; and by it, on the edge of a chair, sat a woman in a black bonnet and shawl. Frank crossed; the woman turned; \n\nFrank stopped. It was Sarah Butler. There came to Frank Barry, as he stood there dumfounded between the table and the sideboard, a vivid memory of something he had seen nearly three years before-a cottage wall, a window below the thatch, a face above the sill, a sneering face set round with a frilled night-cap; and with the memory came to him also a numb feeling of dismay. Sarah Butler? Nan's mother? Why had she come? He plucked at his collar-band; moved a step; halted, and stood looking at the fire. Sarah rose. \"Good-evenin', Mr. Barry,\" said she. \"I hope I'm seein' ye well?”\n\nIt was the old voice, the old shrill voice; and to \n\nFrank's ears it came like an echo from the buried past. He turned; quickly put out his hand, as quickly withdrew it, and laid it on the back of a chair. 66 \n\nGood-evening, Mrs. Butler,\" he answered. \"Goodevening.\" He paused; rubbed his hand backwards and forwards along the chair-back; looked round. \"Won't you sit down?\" said he. Behind her hand Sarah coughed; drew out a rag of pocket-handkerchief, wiped her lips, and once more seated herself on the edge of a chair. Her eyes shifted quickly here and there; presently fixed themselves on Frank's face.

He turned a chair; sat down, set his elbow on the table and his cheek on his hand. \"Yes,\" he said; \"yes, indeed.\" Sarah coughed again; ran a finger between chin and bonnet string, shifted back an inch in her chair. \"Ye didn't expect to see me here, Mr. Barry,\" she ventured, part asserting, part questioning. Frank looked at her. 66 \n\nNo,\" he said. \"Frankly, I did not.\" 66 \n\nAy. Just so. It'll be a good while since we seen other last, Mr. Barry,\" Sarah went on after a pause. Frank nodded. \"A long time it is; three years a'most. Ay, nearly three years.\" Sarah sighed. \"An' sure a power can happen in three years; ay, a power.\" Still Frank sat silent. Why had she come? he kept thinking. How did she find out? He turned his eyes; met Sarah's full; hastily looked away. \"Yes. Oh, yes. How-how's John, Mrs. Butler?\" \"John? Aw, John's the best, so he is-what's left of him. An' I'm rightly meself, Mr. Barry,\" Sarah volunteered. 66\n\nAn'-yis, Nan's as well as ye could expect, so she is; jist as well.”\n\nFrank reddened, dived for the poker, and began stirring the fire.

John went on with his rigmarole. Frank leant back in his chair, hooked his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat; with the tail of his eye fell to observing the methods of rustic lovers. Close together, almost elbow to elbow, they sat; yet of each other's presence seemed to take no heed. As wooden as a graven image, Ted sat sucking at his pipe. Like patience on a monument (the simile is Frank's own), Nan sat staring at the pothooks. Surely they must have quarrelled? thought Frank. Surely this Ross was a very boor. He took good stock of him. A muscular young fellow he seemed; broad of shoulder, thick of neck, big of limb. His face was strong and well moulded; his brown hair curled closely; his skin shone healthily. He was dressed in rough tweed, leggings, a peaked cap and hobnailed boots. No Adonis, thought Frank, decidedly no gentleman; still, and Frank glanced at Nan, no denying that physically they were a well-matched pair.

Frank raised his brows, smiled to himself; then stretched his legs towards the blaze and gave full ear to John's discourse. Hitherto John had been talking disjointedly, halfheartedly; now, at sight of Frank giving him full heed, quickly he found himself, stretched forth a hand and gave his tongue the reins. The subject was Ireland (that everlasting subject), and the land question (that eternal question); vehemently John grappled with it. Ah, he knew a thing or two. Hadn't he eyes? What were politicians but a tribe of bagpipes? What was Government but an old woman? What was Ireland but a home of lost causes? and John rolled the phrase, picked, doubtless, in some chance garden of editorial wisdom, about his tongue. What were its people but beggars, outcasts, hewers of wood and drawers of water? Who would save Ireland, sir? shouted John, shooting forth a finger. Would England, sir? Would politicians, sir? Would God save Ireland? shouted \n\nJohn again. No, sir. But this is what would save her, and John's voice sank solemnly: Herself, sir, and her own true sons. Frank sat listening to this, and to ever so much more, with enjoyment. It was all so novel, so whimsical. The scene, the moment, appealed to him. He liked this windbag of a John, liked to watch his moon-red face, his flaming eyes, darting hands; liked to hear his voice, so mellow and big and richly twanged with the loughside brogue.

He could quote you leading articles, Latin quotations and all, by the yard. He could recite whole pages from Bunyan, and long chapters from the Book of Proverbs or the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Con stantly in his discourse was some chance line, garnered in heaven knows what corner of the mighty\n\nPress, of the poets in evidence. He knew much of \n\nPope by heart."}

Hard I strode out southwards; after a long while, came to Oxford street, turned and made for the Marble Arch. In the park, at the usual corner, a crowd had gathered round a demagogue. I was tired; drew closer; rested against the railings, and listlessly gave ear. Suddenly, among the crowd, uprose a mighty voice, a thunderous bellow, a sound as of St. Patrick scattering vermin on Tara's hill: and there before me, in all his might and glory, red face, tattered coat, battered hat and all, stood John Butler-the round peg in the round hole at last! I got as near as I dared, and kept eye and ear open. John was marvellous. Really he has missed his vocation-or found it. His face shone with the light and fervour of inspiration. His gestures were regal. Never on the stage have I seen the emotions play finer havoc with the human countenance. The thunder of indignation, the flash of scorn, the withering whisper of sarcasm, the supercilious taunt, the enlivening jest: one after another, you had them hot and breathless from that wondrous tongue. Really the man has gifts. Not to one in a million is given his astonishing talent of speech. I could imagine him-educated, trained-a second Grattan, a greater O'Connell. And\nLONDON. 385 there he stood, thumping the democratic tub in Hyde Park, rending the firmament with screed and brogue! Well, he is happy, I suppose; happier than most. I must see him again. Not now. I'm not in the humour for diversion. I'm waiting for-for something. July 21. I have been to Camberwell. Here is what I found: Dear Frank-Thank you for the money. I am most careful, and am keeping a strict account. Yes; it is quite sufficient. The boy is well. Marian. That is all! That is the answer to all my longing, and hoping, and waiting-that! So does she show how she feels for me!"}

Went to a literary dinner last evening. Enjoyed it. Have a head to-day, though. I can see clearly that for men to get on they must show themselves. I made heaps of friends last night: big men, men I should have known long ago. That's the worst of married life; it buries you. September 15. Had lunch to-day with a great critic. I think we got on well together. He may be useful some day. The novel drags slightly; think I'll give it a rest. Just off for an hour to the club. September 17. To-day being Sunday, I went out\nTHE BARRYS. to hear friend John's democratic sermon. It was immense. The amount of Atheism, Jacobitism, Radicalism, Ruffianism, and all the rest, he has managed to soak up from Walworth pewter pots is amazing; and there stood the fools agape whilst he squeezed himself upon them!... After a while, who should come up but Ted and Nan. It was a funny meeting. Ted was awkward at first; Nan blushed charmingly, but held herself well. They had come to thank me, said they, for what I had done for them. They? said I; then it was true that affairs had prospered? \"Aw, yes,\" said Ted, looking at his boots; \"we've come to an understandin' at last.\" \"At last,\" repeated I, looking at Nan. \"Yes,\" said she, and met my eyes fearlessly; \"at last, Mr. Barry.\" I laughed and changed the subject. They are a well-matched pair. God bless them, as their compatriots do say. They proffered their thanks without stint. I received them with a wave of my hand; and looking again at Nan, asked myself for what had I not to thank her? For a great deal, it seemed to me. Still, I make no reproach. I am chief sinner against myself. Nan was simply the instrument of my friend the Piper. She looked very charming, I thought. Does she love Ted? Does she love him as somebody once taught her to love? I can answer with confidence. . . . Let that all go. I'm a hardened, dusty, old fossil now. Just before they went, said Nan: \"You're often in these parts, Mr. Barry?\" \"Yes,\" said I. \"Have ye flitted from Camberwell, then?\" she asked, and looked keenly at me. \"As butterflies flit,\" answered \n\nI, with a laugh. But she looked dubious. . . . A ...\nLONDON. 397 while ago, Nan could have helped me; a while ago, I should have welcomed her help; now, it only occurs to me. I am indifferent. Why is it? Has the frost of cynicism set in? Or is it only the reaction? . . . Must end now. Just off to a fellow's diggings. Smoke, talk, grog; cards maybe, after twelve. Such is life nowadays. September 25. The entries in this Journal grow sparse, I notice. I have little to enter, and less time than of yore. Somehow, I'm always out of evenings. Life goes with me now. Old Omar, or somebody, was right: the Sapients make of the world only an inn where they tarry for a while. And a mighty cosy inn, too, when the lamps are ablaze. Eh, father mine? What are you thinking up there, so silent and calm? September 28. How is it the old days seem so remote? I look back on three months ago as through the large end of a telescope. Time seems to have raised a mound upon them. I wonder how Marian is feeling? Is the small end of her glass towards me also? ... Ah, when that day comes, if ever it comes now, won't she find me changed indeed!"}

The time for these things is past. You have said your say; I mine. You have your view of things; I mine. You have decided on a course of action, and are taking it; I also have now decided-not impulsively, you understand, not without patient deliberation-on my course of action, and am going to take it. 371\nTHE BARRYS. \"You have asked for time in which to regain the trust and love which I, through my misdeeds-misdeeds wilfully distorted and magnified, be it saidhave caused you to lose. You prefer to remain with your mother rather than give me the chance to aid you in your quest, rather than to do what some people-not I, remember-might call your duty to child and husband. However, let that pass. All I wish now to say to you is, what I said to you verbally this evening, that you will please me by pleasing yourself, and will do what you consider right in your own way and at your leisure. You are quite free. Far be it from me to dictate or advise. As I said, stay just as long as you like. Do not consider me at all.

Terrible bad luck. I lost last night -I'm afraid to reckon how much. This must not go on. Why, I haven't a pound to send to Marian. Shameful, oh shameful, Frank Barry! Next thing \n\nI'll be stealing from the boy's fund. Never-never! October 18. Have changed my apartments again. Am now vegetating in one room in Bedford Street. It's nearer the seat of war.

She knelt and asked God to bless everyone; to bless her father and mother and all her friends, to bless Ted and keep him, to bless Frank and keep him: yes, Nan asked \n\nGod to bless Frank Barry, who just then sat smoking in Ryfield parlour and pondering the portrait of his Marian; and to bless Ted Ross, who just then was\nINISHRATH. 149 rising from his place behind a hedge, and muttering as he rose \"She said, Is that you, Frank?

Hurriedly she ran down the lane, pushed out the cot and started for Garvagh. He might come, her heart sang in time with the oars; he might come. Who knows? Vigorously, with something of her old gladness of heart, she swung to and fro on the thwart. He might. He might, she murmured. The cot neared the shore. She dared not look. He might. He might, she said. The cot swung round. She lifted her eyes and there stood old Hugh Barry. The gladness died in \n\nNan's heart. Old Hugh, thought she; not Frank, but his grim old uncle. The cot ran up on the landing-place; without a word, Hugh stepped in and stiffly sat down. His face looked mighty hard, Nan thought, mighty hard and cold. She rowed a stroke or two; then, with an effort: \"It'll be fine weather, Mr. Barry?\" said she, looking at her hands. \"It is, thank God,\" answered Hugh. \"It's the best o' weather.\" \"Ye'll be for the Lismahee side, Mr. Barry?\" \"For Inishrath, I'll thank ye.\" Hugh pointed at the island with his staff. \"Inishrath, I'll thank ye.\" Nan looked swiftly at him.

Ay, faith, thought he; ay, faith. So this was the jade who was making a fool of Frank. Just so. She had grown a trifle these last few years; she seemed a strong, well-boned wench; he supposed she had her share of good looks? Yes, she had. She was the kind of damsel Frank's father used to look twice at. She had good eyes in her. She had a good face. He liked the way her hair-Phat! One would think he was Frank! Fiercely, Hugh smote the gunwale with his staff and looked away. Nan rowed on; presently, old Hugh looked at her again.

At once the room was filled with chatter, greetings, laughter; soon fell quiet again as the door closed upon Marian and her mother and the three men were left to themselves.

Not one of his white hairs was awry; his whiskers were perfection; the parting that ran from nape to crown was mathematical in its correctness.

From top to toe he looked the pink of cleanliness, decency; a fine specimen of your average, middleclass Englishman, insular, it might be, and not intellectually endowed, yet standing upright in his square-toed shoes. For a while he stood warming his hands and uttering this truism and that, about the weather, the stalest politics, the latest news; then turned, tucked hands under coat-tails and swayed forward on his toes. \"Well, Frank, my boy,\" said he, and strove to hide the twinkle in his eyes; \"what's your opinion, now, of things in general?\" Frank had been confidently awaiting that. It was the Dad's great joke; one that had seen service on a thousand hearthrugs. He laughed, winked across at Rab; answered the \n\nDad as always, in the like case, he had answered, by offering him pipe and tobacco. \"Smoke, Dad,\" said he. \"Do now. Come, be sociable.\" The Dad chuckled and looked slyly at Frank. 66 “Ah, you rascal,\" said he, and repeated himself for the thousandth time. \"You murderin' villain; an' is it carried home on a stretcher you'd have me.\" He turned to Rab and began fumbling in his tail pocket. \"You know, Mr. Lindsay,\" he went on, with that air of jauntiness which, in his moments of humour, he usually affected, \"these young rascals of Irishmen want careful watching.

Low on a stool, Sarah sat rounding the heel of a gaudy red and blue sock, her eyes fast on John's face, her lips moving in count with the loops that slipped from her fingers. On his left, now moved a little farther back from the hearth, the lovers sat whispering and bobbing heads. What were they saying? Frank wondered. What of pretty, or of amorous even, could a lout like Ted \n\nRoss find wherewith to witch Nan's little ear? Suppose he, Frank Barry, in Ted's place, would he be able to say aught that Ted had never said, bring from Nan smiles that Ted had never seen, see something shining in her eyes that Ted might never see?

And to think that her beauty, her worth, were all for the keeping, sooner or later, of a bumpkin! It was woful, thought Frank; then, writhed on his chair, and set it creaking; and at the sound, Nan looked up, caught his eye, blushed, looked down and nudged her sweetheart. With a clatter of his stool and a muttered oath, round swung Ted; and Frank turning, found John's face, as round and rosy as a harvest-moon, turned full upon him. His eyes were twinkling; knowingly he winked at Frank, laughed and jerked his thumb towards the lovers. \"They make a purty pair?\" said he. \"Eh, Frank?\" Nan blushed deeper. Ted scowled. Frank grinned. \"I seen ye watchin' them,\" John went on. ye rascal ye.

Patiently the Dad plodded through a page of Macaulay; then closed the book on his thumb, set a chair in its right place, and came to the fire. His face was pulled solemn; in deep thought he stood for a moment, looking at his boots. \"Yes,\" said he, \"it's magnificent.\" He sighed, rubbed his nose; looked up. \"You know, Mr. \n\nLindsay,\" he went on, \"one of the greatest regrets I have is that I can't find leisure to peruse my books. Quite a lot of them I have-haven't I, Frank ?-quite a number of really excellent books; and yet, I assure you, there they stand, day after day, week after week, positively unopened. You see,\" said the Dad, with a wave of his hand, \"I have such a lot to do. Some most important transactions, some most confidential papers receive my consideration."}

A dead trust? Now a dead love? A dead love,\" he mused, smiling bitterly. \"Frank,\" cried Marian, \"be just to me. It isn't dead. No, no; I couldn't think that. But it seems gone. I can't help it. I've tried-oh, how I've tried! Give me time, Frank; just a little longer.\" From her heart Marian spoke, and with her hands out stepped towards Frank.

And nowhere did he shine more gloriously than by his own fireside; there, with his old father blankly eyeing him across the hearth, with Sarah his wife facing him, hands spread on her knees, back as straight as any ramrod, eyes and face very signals of attention, with Ted and Nan sitting mum at his elbow, and some chance visitor in the post of honour before the fire. At these times, John was great, but set a man such as Frank-a scholar, a Londoner and a Barry-in sight of the pothooks, and John was mighty. He quoted, ranted, banged his knees, whacked his fists, tore this poor Irish question into quivering shreds: whew-w, you might have thought him some impassioned patriot lunging it from \n\nTara's hill. And Frank, lounging in the chair of honour, now glancing at Nan, now at Sarah, sometimes flinging an encouraging word into the bonfire\nTHE BARRYS. of John's eloquence, enjoyed it all vastly; vowed to himself that the thing was worth all the screeds of \n\nHyde Park or the thunderings of Peckham Rye. Presently, John's tongue slackened somewhat, and, in the lull that came, Frank heard Nan laugh softly. He looked; there were our sweethearts with their heads together. Ted had twisted round on his stool, and cheek on hand was whispering; Nan, hands crossed on her lap, and her eyes lowered, was listening. Her lips were slightly parted; there was a smile on her face; and at sight of her Frank frowned. John's voice died out. Softly came the whispering. Sure, I waited an' waited for ye outside, an' ye niver came. Och, I niver heard one word the preacher said for thinkin' of ye.\" \"Did ye, Ted? Did ye?\" \"Och, ye might have managed to come. Sure, powerful lonely I was all the way home.\" \"Whisht, Ted, whisht;\" and at the word, Ted, suddenly aware that silence had fallen upon the kitchen, rushed round on his stool, glared at Frank; then leant towards the fire to light his pipe. Steadily Frank kept his eyes on Nan's face. How well that blush became her. What brows she had, what lips, what hair! Nan looked up, glanced at \n\nFrank, flushed crimson, and dropped her eyes again. Ah, what eyes, what eyes! John smoked for a while; rested elbows on knees, clasped his hands, turned once more towards Frank. \"You'd be thinkin' a power, Frank, o' the poetry o' Pope, I'm thinkin'?\" said he, cocking his head. \"No, John; as poetry I think but little of it.\" \"Ay? Just so. An' why, may I ask?\" 66\nINISHRATH. 69 \n\nOh, Frank had many reasons for his opinion: was \n\nJohn very anxious to hear them? Yes; John was bursting with anxiety. Well, then . . . and Frank went on to state his case. John listened attentively, contenting himself with an occasional snort of dissent, or a wondering click of the tongue; listened attentively till Frank had finished, then smacked his lips and turned to the fire. Ah, yes. Frank spoke like a newspaper, so he did. Pope didn't write poetry, said Frank; he was only a kind of pastrycook that baked cakes of prose and put a crust of rhyme on top. That was how \n\nFrank talked. Yes. \"But mebbe ye'd tell me,\" quoth John, glancing sideways at Frank, \"what ye might call this prose?\" Frank defined prose. \"An' what might ye call poetry?\" asked John, with a knowing look in his eye. Frank gave a definition of poetry. \"Ay,\" said John. \"I know. Well, there's a newspaper over there. D'ye call that poetry?\" Of course Frank did not. \"Well, in the top corner of that newspaper,\" John went on, \"ye'll find somethin' headed, An Ode to \n\nSpring. It goes like this ;\" and whacking his hands together in pace with the rhythm, John quoted a verse or two of hillside doggerel. \"D'ye call that prose, now?\" Of course Frank did not. \"Isn't poetry, then?\" John's voice rang in a shout of victory."}

Come on, sir, an' quit your bleather,\" cried Hugh; then, as if fearing lest \n\nFrank, at the last moment, should repent of his going, hurried on, wound up the hills and through the rushes; descended at last and came to the shore, and to James the herd sitting by it in his little cot.

Marian crossed, looked down upon the garden and the old folk standing there; shut the window, turned and stood waiting. Frank closed the door, sat the boy on the bed, kissed him and gave him a toy. \"There, my son,\" said he, patting the wee head; \"be good for a little while. Papa will soon take you again—soon take you again,\" repeated Frank; then wheeled quickly and took a step from the bed. \"Marian,\" said he, \"how much longer, I ask you, is all this to continue? Don't you think you have punished me quite enough? Suppose me the greatest of criminals, am I not still your husband and at least worth the trouble of an answer?\" Not a word could Marian say. Frank took another step towards her. \"Great heavens,\" cried he; \"what has come to you? Do you know what you are doing? Answer me, Marian; you must answer me! Do you know, say, what you are doing?\" There came a moment or two of silence, broken only by the deep swelling of Frank's breath and the gurgle of the boy over his play; a little while of silence, with Marian standing rigid by the dressingtable, and Frank facing her with clenched hands and blazing eyes. \"Do you know?\" he repeated, and at the words Marian looked at him. \"Know?\" she said, huskily and slowly. \"Yes, I know.\" She stopped; drew a breath that was half a sob, and raised a hand to her cheek. \"Oh,\" she\nLONDON. 365 said,\" I don't know what has come to me.

Yes, they identified themselves with the glory and the military history of France. These tradesmen of Paris, awkward and uneasy in stiff, tight uniforms, jostling each other in their formations like a flock of sheep, handling a musket with obvious fear of its recoil; assumed to themselves a share in the past triumphs of heroes who could hold their own with Marlborough's grenadiers, and check the picked cavalry of Prince Eugéne; who advanced into action with a hand of fiddles, curled, gloved, scented, and cravatted as if for a ball, and left their dead in hundreds wherever a battery was to be taken, or an outwork of the enemy carried by storm. Could there be one single sentiment in common between a Black Musketeer of Louis the Great, with his debts, his dandyism, his refined prejudices, his intrigues, his duels, his dainty scorn of death, and a respectable grocer, comfortable, thrifty, industrious, sorting goods, posting a ledger, and coming in regularly to his meals? Only this, that each was a Frenchman, and, as a Frenchman, set his country above everything on earth, except her military glory, which he loved even better than France. With six months' campaigning, and a few volleys fired in earnest, these citizens were hereafter to make the finest soldiers in Europe, but at present they were no match for a mere rabble, for a mob of ruffians commanded by Santerre, the scum and sweepings of the streets. THE TRICOLOR. 209 Red, white, and blue were the colours of the good city of Paris. Her national guards elected to wear them in a cockade, and thus originated the famous Tricolor, the flag that, torn to shreds by shot and shell, has floated triumphant in every part of the world where danger is to be encountered and honour won. As the cross to Crusaders, the crescent to Saracens, as our own unconquered Union Jack to sturdy Britons, is the Tricolor to the warlike sons of France. Where it waves there will they make their rush, loose in formation, firing as they advance, but pressing eagerly to the front. How many hearts have shed their life-blood to further it twenty paces in the charge, to preserve its honour unsullied in the retreat; how many eyes swimming in death, and watching it to the last, have taken its image with them into another world; how many noble spirits, swelling with pride and patriotism, have trooped gloriously into Paris under the remnants of their victorious flag!"}

Send him back with a guard into Paris!\" But Coupe-tête, for whom the favour of the mob was the very bread he ate, had disappeared; and already scowling brows and loud imprecations warned Montarbas that his own forbearance to a cassock was viewed with suspicion, as a symptom of insincerity, a leaning towards that reaction, the\nROSINE. fear of which drove the revolution deeper and deeper into an abyss of fire, from which anarchy and confusion were to reappear forged and moulded anew in the form of an iron despotism, all-powerful for evil, utterly hopeless and helpless for good. \"Down with the priest!\" they vociferated. \"Down with the cassock! Down with Montarbas, if he will take his part! They are aristocrats; they are in league to betray the nation. Treachery! treachery! Down with them both!\" It was a critical moment, and would have shaken the nerves of most men; yet Montarbas retained his coolness, his presence of mind, and that decision of character, that promptitude of action, right or wrong, which entitles men to command. . \"I can save you now, Monsieur,\" he whispered, \"if you will hold your tongue!\" \"Speak out, Count!\" answered the other, smiling scornfully; \"I will do my duty, whether or not you flinch from yours!\" 66 Montarbas shrugged his shoulders. \"The man is an enthusiast, a fanatic,\" said he, beckoning to Santerre, who came striding through the crowd. \"I cannot stay here to argue till sunrise. Take him to the rear and have him guarded-gagged if you like, and with his hands tied, but do not shed his blood. We might want him in an hour or two, if the aristocrats yonder are disposed to come to terms.\" Santerre shook his head. \"Who is Citizen Montarbas,\" growled this leader of ruffians, \"that I should take his orders? A noble! an aristocrat! What! a peer of France. He is not a man of the people. He is not one of us! Wait a bit, my little Count! Santerre has his eye on you. Perhaps it will take you all your time to look out for yourself!\" And here is the difficulty with which such leaders have to\ncontend. There is a downward impetus in its progress, that those who set a revolution in motion are powerless to arrest.

What a contrast to her childhood, her youth, her early history; yet did it seem now a perfectly natural consequence that she should be the companion, the friend, the confidant of her beloved Sovereign. It is strange how soon humanity accommodates itself to changes that would have once been accounted simple impossibilities. The incredible in anticipation becomes almost commonplace when we look back, and it is not too much to say that no man was ever yet raised to a pinnacle he esteemed one inch too high for his merits, or placed in so unexpected a position, but that he felt he had realised something of the same kind before. It takes a culprit scarcely ten minutes to recover the effects of a sentence of death.

How touching those broad patches of grey in the rich brown hair, marks of the destroyer who had passed like a flame over her fairest years, withering the promise of youth, and blasting the glory of womanhood into a scorched and dreary waste!

He had trudged through the snow to pay his accustomed visit, dressed even more carefully than usual-for it was his maxim to be abrupt with a duchess, but ceremonious with a dairymaid and had found the hearth fireless, the house untenanted. It was some time before he could realise the trick thus played on him, before he could believe it possible that his own people should have dared to decline his favours, and repudiate his authority. Only after research and inquiry did he become convinced of the fact that Pierre Legros had decamped with his promised bride, to some hiding-place beyond the reach of feudal superiority and its hateful privileges. It is difficult enough for the red man to destroy his trail as he leaves it behind him in the wilderness, covering the foot prints with leaves and grass, traversing to and fro, winding in and out to baffle his enemy; but in a civilised country money and influence can wrest information from the very bird of the air; and a fugitive may no more hope to elude pursuit than a hunted deer with a pack of bloodhounds on her track.

He laughed, he trifled, he flattered, he would not enter on serious conversation, but went away, as she thought, far too soon, with a laughing request, in which there was yet less of jest than earnest, that she would soon afford him an excuse to come and see her again.

Yes, he was handsome, there could be no question. Slight, graceful, well-proportioned, with an air of confident, careless goodnature that possessed a certain charm. More experienced perceptions would have read profligate in every line of that delicate high-bred face, but she only saw a refined beauty, too feminine perhaps for her taste, and the polish of a society she never hoped and scarcely wished to enter.

Are you not afraid, or have you, with the face of a Hebe, the heart of a grenadier ?”\n\nShe did not know what a Hebe meant, but his gaiety was catching, and she replied with a laugh, checked even as it rose: \"There are wolves of many kinds, monsieur, in these forests.

But see! he takes off his sheepskin to shelter you. Have you not a kind word for him now ?\" While he spoke, he stripped off a loose upper jacket lined with fur, and wrapped it round her shoulders, as another blast drove its snow-cloud over their heads. She could not but be grateful for the attention; nor, indeed, could she fail to remark the neat, well-chosen dress and symmetrical figure that he thus exposed to the storm. \"It is too much, monsieur,\" she murmured; \"too much kindness, too much honour.

At this we all laughed especially Annabel. Frank's jokes usually appealed to her, though Fay's didn't, which was strange, as the twins resembled each other mentally almost as much as they did physically: it was only in the deeper places of the spirit that the resemblance ended. \"Reggie is not old and he is not young,\" said Annabel; \"I never can understand why people make such a fuss about their ages.

One of her most fascinating tricks was a habit she had of trotting about the house and garden after me like a little child.

She thought you were old!\" I laughed, and patted the soft, white cheek so near to my own as we sat down side by side on a gardenseat. \"No, she didn't, little one.\" \"Well, anyway she said so.\" \"No, she didn't. She said I was forty-threewhich I am, and forty-three seems quite young to \n\nAnnabel, though old to you.\" Fay still looked angry. \"Indeed it doesn't. It seems quite young to me. And whatever it seems, I don't see the good of harping on it and rubbing it in, as Annabel is always doing. If she says 'forty-three' again, I shall say 'twopenny dam.'\" I laughed outright. Fay was so delicious when she was annoyed, like a brilliant little bird with ruffled plumage. Then I said softly, as I put my arms round her slender waist: \"No you won't, sweetheart, you'll never say it again, if it vexes Annabel.

But I am inclined to think that as there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, so the gift of healing is given to one, the gift of preaching to another, and so on, and we have not all the same gifts. It is all Christ working in us; but He works one way in one person and another way in another.

Both the Wildacres had always been slight and slender, but it was the slightness and slenderness of perfect health: now Frank's thinness amounted to positive emaciation, and his face was pinched and peaked. Moreover, he had lost that appearance of essential and eternal youth which had been so marked a characteristic of him and of Fay, and without which he hardly seemed a Wildacre at all. But in one thing he was unchanged, and that was in his perfect ease of manner and absolute unself-consciousness. Although I could see that it required all his self-control to enable him to respond naturally to my greeting, as indeed it required all my self-control to give it, nevertheless he succeeded: and I could not help admiring the pluck and courage of the boy when \n\nI remembered how much lay between his departure from the Manor and his return to it. As I recalled what bright and beautiful beings Wildacre and his children had been at one time, and realised that this broken wreck of a boy was all that was left of the once brilliant trio, a wave of misery at the pity of it all swept over my soul. I thought of \n\nWildacre as he used to be in the old boyish days, and then of Frank and Fay when they first came to the \n\nRecto after their father's death: and I felt that I was face to face with the hopeless tragedy of what might have been but was not, because the folly and sin of man frustrated the Wisdom and Righteousness of God, as for some hidden reason it has been per-\nmitted to do ever since the forbidden tree was planted in the midst of the garden. And that is how the last of the Wildacres came to Restham. For some days I saw but little of Frank. Ponty took him into her tender keeping and set about nursing him back to health, only allowing him to come downstairs and lie on the Chesterfield couch by the hall fire for a few hours every day. It was astonishing to me to find Ponty so good to Frank. She had always resented his presence at Restham even before he had worked any mischief there: yet now she took him into her charge, and nursed him as devotedly as if she had been his mother. I remarked upon this change of front one day. \"I am surprised you are so kind to Mr. Wildacre, Ponty, considering how angry you were when first I asked him to come and live at the Manor. I was afraid you wouldn't like his coming back in this way.\" \"Well, you see, Master Reggie, when I was that set against his coming to the Manor, he was strong and well, and so could stand up to me, as you might say: but now he is too weak and ill to hurt a fly. There's lots of folks as you can't stand at any price when they are able to stick up for themselves: but when they are knocked down you'd do anything you could to help them to get up again.' 99 \"Women are made like that-thank God!\" I said. \"I remember there was a girl at Poppenhall who'd had a fine upstanding young man after her for years and years, and she couldn't so much as look at him, though all the other girls envied her for having such a handsome beau: but he lost an arm and got his face scarred in an accident down a coal-pit, and then she married him at once, and spent the rest of her life\nin looking after him and trying to take the place of his lost arm.' 99 \"A woman all over!\" I remarked."}

I dressed hurriedly, and without waiting for any breakfast went straight to the Rectory to remind \n\nBlathwayte of what Henderson had said. It was too early as yet for the doctor's visit, and the night-nurse was still upon duty; but she had nothing good to report, as Fay's temperature kept up and her strength was failing. \"Come and see,\" said Blathwayte, when I had recalled Henderson's words to his mind. \"If he was right, and you have the gift, you may save Fay's life even yet.\" And he took me into the sick-room, where the shadow of my darling lay fighting for breath. Then followed another of those experiences which sound incredible in the telling, but which was so natural-so inevitable-at the time, that it would have been impossible for anything else to have happened. I knelt down by Fay's bed and laid my hand on her burning forehead, and I lifted up my soul to God in prayer, as I had never lifted it before. As I prayed\n\nI became conscious-as I had been when Frank seemed dying of a Presence in the room, the Presence of a living Christ who was standing by my side so near that I could almost feel His Touch-so real that I felt if I opened my eyes I should see His Face. And with His coming all the sorrow and anxiety and misery disappeared, and I knew that nothing could ever really harm her or pluck her out of His Hand. Fear vanished, because with Him beside me there was nothing to fear: sorrow disappeared, because He brought with Him fulness of joy: death stood at bay, because He had conquered death. There was nothing\nIIO  \n\nany longer except Him, because in Him and through Him and of Him are all things. And I was conscious not only of a profound peace in this Ineffable Presence: \n\nI was conscious also of an inexhaustible power. I felt flowing into me, and through me into Fay, a sort of wonderful electric current-a very elixir of life itself-which I can describe as nothing but \"the Power from on High.\" At that moment I felt that I had the wings of eagles, and the strength of the angels that excel. How long I knelt I know not. It was a moment snatched from eternity, and therefore beyond the measurements of time. I realised that in His glorious \n\nPresence there is neither past nor future, but only one glorious, unending Now. Gradually the Presence withdrew Itself, and the rush of Power flowing through me subsided, and I opened my eyes and looked at Fay. The fever flush in her cheeks was already fading, and the brow under my hand grew cool and moist. I rose from my knees and told the nurse to take the temperature: she did so, and found it rapidly subsiding. The pulse, too, was slower, and the breathing much easier. By the time that the doctor came he was able to say that the crisis was past, and that the patient was on the way to recovery. Of course, both the doctor and the nurses were amazed beyond words: they could not account for such a sudden and unexpected turn for the better. But I was not surprised. I had been too recently in the Presence of Christ to wonder at any manifestation of His Power."}

But it's a pity! For though I'm the last to say a word against Miss Annabel, me having nursed. her ever since she was a month old, and the most beautiful baby you ever saw, with a complexion like wax, still she's a bit too wilful, and you and your poor papa always having given way to her has made her worse. It doesn't do to be too self-willed.\" \"But I'm not,\" I pleaded. \"No; more's the pity! It would be a sight better for Miss Annabel if you were. I don't hold with folks always getting their own way, especially women. I remember a well-to-do woman at Poppenhall when I was a girl who was that set on marrying a particular man as never was, and nothing else would do to content her. And they lived on at her house after they were married, her being a woman of means. He caught the fever from drinking the water out of her well, the well not having been cleaned out for years and most unhealthy, and died just a month after their wedding-day, which I hold was a judgment on her for being so set on marrying that particular man.\" \"But any other man might have got the fever from the insanitary well,\" I suggested. \"But no other man ever did. Which is a lesson to us all not to be too set on having our own way, nor to let other people be too set either.

How could anything put the sunshine out, Reggie? How silly you are!\" \"It is pure superstition,\" answered Blathwayte, who found it as blessed to give information as did my sister to receive it; \"a fire naturally by force of contrast looks less brilliant in the sunlight than in the shade, but the sunlight has no actual effect on it whatsoever.\" At this juncture I happened to catch Frank's eye, and to my delight perceived that the humour of the situation struck him as it struck me. Of course I knew how funny it was of Annabel and Arthur to take hold of all the romance of life, and transmute it-\nFRANK by some strange alchemy of their own-into useful and intelligent information; I had seen them at it for years and years, and had never failed to enjoy the sight; but it was very clever of Frank, who had known \n\nArthur for two months and Annabel for twenty minutes, to see that it was funny also. \"My last question was not so silly after all,\" I remarked. \"I think the sunshine of life is frequently extinguished by a too great absorption in the cares of the domestic hearth. See, for instance, those numerous cases where the energy of the spring-fever expends itself upon the exigencies of the spring-cleaning.” \"I hate a spring-cleaning,\" exclaimed Frank: \"it always means that everything is put back into something else's place, and you can never find anything you want till you've left off wanting it.\" \"But you find all the things you wanted the spring before last,\" I added, \"and have now forgotten that you ever possessed, and have no longer any use for.\" \"And all your books seem to have played General \n\nPost,\" continued Frank; \"Volume One has changed places with Volume Six, and the dictionary is where the Bible ought to be, and the cookery book is among the poems. \"I never keep a Bible in a bookcase,\" remarked \n\nAnnabel; \"it somehow doesn't seem reverent to do so.\" I could not let this pass.. \"Yes, you do: you keep one in that bookcase in your bedroom. I've seen it there.\" \"Oh! a bookcase in a bedroom is quite a different thing from an ordinary library bookcase, Reggie; in fact I never keep any but religious books in my bedroom bookcase. One doesn't, somehow.\" \"I cannot see,\" I argued, \"why a hanging book-\ncase in a bedroom-forming, mark you, a companion ornament to the medicine-chest on the other side of the wardrobe-is a more reverent resting-place for a Bible than is the shelf of a well-stocked library. Why should clothes and drugs exhale a more holy atmosphere than secular literature?\" But no arguments ever shook Annabel. \"I can't explain why it's different, but it is different, Reggie; and if you don't see it, you ought to. And I'm sure the sun does put it out, Arthur, because I've seen it do it.\" Whereupon Arthur proceeded to expound at some length the reason why it was scientifically impossible for sunlight to put out firelight; whilst Frank and I took the opportunity of stepping out-of-doors into the garden. \"I see what you mean about things being so much more than they actually are, Sir Reginald,\" began the boy as soon as we were out of earshot of the effects -or rather the non-effects-of sun upon fire; \"it never struck me quite like that before, but it makes everything most awfully interesting when you look at it in that way.' 99 \"I know it does.

And the memory conjured up a vision of one of the most attractive personalities I had ever met. Wildacre had been a friend of Blathwayte's and mine at Oxford; but after we left college the friendship had gradually fizzled out, owing to the extreme (not to say dull) respectability of Arthur and myself, and the exact opposite on the part of Wildacre.

The idea seemed impossible. Wildacre had always been so full of life that one couldn't imagine him and Death hobnobbing; they could have nothing in common with each other! And as to that Other Life beyond the grave-in which in my own way I believed quite as firmly as did Arthur-one couldn't imagine Wildacre at home there either. \"Wildacre mustn't die yet!\" I exclaimed; \"not till he's done something with all that genius of his and that overflowing energy! I couldn't bear to think of his dying until he's made a name for himself. Wildacre is a real poet, and he'll be a great poet some day.\" Blathwayte shook his head. \"He once might have been; he had it in him, but he lost his opportunity, and lost opportunities don't return.\" \"No, Arthur, you are right there. There is no bringing the shadow on the dial ten degrees backward. What is past is past, and what is written is written, and Fate sends us no revise proofs to correct. The youth we wasted or frittered or abused or ignored never comes back to us to be lived over again, though we may shout ourselves hoarse with crying for it.\" And for the moment the backwater feeling rushed over me with such force that I felt almost suffocated with the hopeless pain of it. \"That is the real tragedy of life,\" I went on, \"that there are no encores.\" \"Poor Wildacre had it in him to do great things,' said Arthur, \"but he lost his chance. At least he did worse than lose it; he threw it away to the swine, and trampled it among the husks.\" \"But he may do something even yet,\" I argued. \"Genius-and Wildacre had genius-never grows old. And, hang it all, man, he isn't so old after all! He is only two or three years older than we are, and we aren't really old-only buried alive, which is quite a different thing. If we lived in London instead of in the blessed, peaceful country, we should still be considered young men about town. Mind you, I'm not grumbling: I should hate to be a young man about town, and I enjoy being buried alive; but I kick at being called old at forty-two. It's positively libellous !\" 99 \"It isn't because Wildacre is old that he won't do anything now,\" replied Arthur simply; \"but because he is dead.\" The words came to me with a shock."}

CHAPTER V THE \n\nHE six days that Bob Hoffman spent in prison in Antwerp were, to a man of his temperament, almost unbearable. He was well enough treated. The room in which he was confined was fairly commodious, and reasonably well furnished, with no suggestion of the dungeon cell about it. There was an unbarred window from which he might have attempted to escape, but for the fact that it was, in the first place, forty feet from the ground, that in the second, it opened on a courtyard in which paced an armed guard, and in the third, that he had no reason whatever for attempting to escape in any event. Meals, not elaborate, but well cooked, were brought in by an orderly, who glared at him without speaking. No newspapers were allowed him. His belongings, of every sort, down to his fountain pen, his finger ring, his scarf pin, even, had been taken from him. He could not have communicated with anyone outside, had he so desired, which, as matters stood, he did not. A few books in German, product of that period 40\nTHE WEB \n\n41 in Teutonic literature in which materialism had not crowded out the idealism of the race, provided the only means by which he might while away the tedious hours.

Hoffman went up to the rooms, which he found to be a comfortable sitting-room, with bed-chamber adjoining. They were on the third floor, in the rear of the house, and the bow window of the sitting-room overlooked a garden, with the rear windows of a number of houses opposite, just as Herr Schwartz had said. Having his luggage brought up, Hoffman made a hasty toilet, and, after securing a light supper, drove to Lord Brooke's. He had been away from London eight days. It seemed to him as many months. He wondered what Patricia would have to say to him. CHAPTER VII THE \n\nHE Honorable Patricia Burke was a young woman of very decided likes and dislikes. Also, she had a kind heart. Consequently, when, one cold night, a woman called to see her who described herself as a refugee from France, she affected not to notice the upturned nose of Patrick, the butler, who referred to the caller as \"a foreign-looking person,\" and went down to interview the woman herself. Crouched on a leather-covered seat in the hall was a slight, good-looking young girl, with large, eager eyes, and heavy black hair. Her clothing was scanty and poor, her shoes worn, her whole appearance that of one who has suffered much hardship. On the floor beside her stood a shabby leather bag. \"What can I do for you, my girl?\" Patricia asked, in French. The woman replied eagerly. \"I am starving, mademoiselle. I have but just arrived from Paris. I was there employed, as seamstress, in one of the great houses which make the costumes, the gowns. Now there is no more work. The proprietor has gone with the 72\nTHE WEB \n\n73 army. The place is closed. I must live, mademoiselle, and so I came to your so great city to find work. I sew very well, mademoiselle. Can you not perhaps employ me?\" \"What is your name?\" Patricia asked, coldly. \"Violette, mademoiselle. Violette Mercier.\" \"You have your passport, your credentials?” \"Oh, but yes, mademoiselle. They are here. You will look at them, yes?\" She hastily opened her satchel, and taking out a package of papers, thrust them into Patricia's hand. The latter examined them with deliberate care. She felt sorry for this creature, homeless, alone, cast by the necessities of a senseless war upon the mercy of strangers. Also, by some curious fate, it happened that Lady Brooke's regular seamstress had, but the day before, announced that she had received a splendid offer to accompany a wealthy American woman to New York, and would her ladyship be so good as to permit her to go. Miss Martin, the former seamstress, had been an efficient and honest servant, but when, with bulging eyes, she announced the wages that had been offered her, Lady Brooke had let her go at once. She thought it rather a shabby trick on the part of the girl's prospective employer, but then, being an American herself, she understood. THE WEB \n\nIt did not occur to Patricia's unsuspicious nature, that there could be any connection between \n\nMiss Martin's departure on one day, and the arrival, so providentially, of Mademoiselle Mercier, also a seamstress, on the next. The coincidence, if it struck her at all, impressed her as being rather fortunate than otherwise. She summoned Patrick, ordered him to conduct the young woman to the servants' hall and give her something to eat, then, going to the library, showed the girl's papers, which she had retained, to her brother and his wife. \"You know, Nelly,\" she said to Lady Brooke, \"we've been wondering where on earth we could find anyone to take Martin's place, and now we have a chance to get a real French milliner, who has been making gowns and things at one of the big Parisian costumers. It's the luckiest thing in the world, don't you think?\" \"Where is the woman?\" Lady Brooke asked. \"I told Patrick to see that she had something to eat. She looked half-starved.\" Lord Brooke, meanwhile, had been examining the papers."}

The transport Aspermoor leaves Southampton day after tomorrow, conveyed by two destroyers.\" The girl's eyes gleamed. She took a gold pencil from her pocketbook, and wrote a few words upon a card within it. \"Not very important!\" she exclaimed. \"My friend, it is invaluable. In spite of all our efforts, we have been unable to gain any advance information regarding the English transport service to France. Our submarines have been blind. They have not yet succeeded in sinking a single troop-ship. Think what it will mean, to send a whole regiment to the bottom!\" Hoffman thought. The idea filled him with horror. For an instant he was tempted to take the woman by her slender neck and strangle her. What was her life, compared with that of thousands? Despicable work, indeed. Then the knowledge of a great, though to him inexplicable purpose, rose in his mind. The interview he\nTHE WEB \n\n121 had had with the man with the piercing grey eyes, just before his journey to Rotterdam, recurred to him with irresistible force. He had been told to obey, blindly, implicitly, trusting to intelligences superior to his own. Even the sinking of a transport, horrifying as it might seem to him, was as nothing, compared with success in what he had undertaken. He composed his features, hoping that his companion had not observed his momentary weakness. She, however, was far too much occupied with her own thoughts, to pay attention to him. An almost satanic joy shone in her eyes. \"Two days,\" she repeated to herself. \"There will be time. The news will be in Antwerp before midnight. My friend, within fortyeight hours the transport Aspermoor will be at the bottom of the English Channel.” \"Then you think Herr Schwartz will be satisfied?\" Hoffman asked. \"He will be delighted. If you play your cards well, you can make your fortune. This \n\nLord Brooke is a fool. Almost too great a fool, at times. One is apt to be suspicious of information so freely given. But in forty-eight hours we shall know.\" \"Lord Brooke is certainly not a fool,\" Hoffman remarked gloomily. \"He trusts me, that is all. Do not forget that I am his wife's\nTHE WEB \n\n3 brother."}

Gideon felt sure that he would not. Well, he must shoot, there was nothing else for it. As Stephanus came nearer Gideon could see clearly the silvery whiteness of his beard. He thought of the last time his eyes had rested on his brother's face, when the sentence was pronounced, and that then the beard was as black as the wing of a raven. Then a sudden horror struck him to the heart. He could not COULD NOT stain his already guilty hands with this man's blood, after having ruined his life. The threatened curse of \n\nCain thundered in his ears. With a wild shriek he sprang from the wagon, and fled among the naked, piled-up rocks which formed the base of the \n\n---\nhideous mountain at the foot of which his wagon stood. Unheeding the shout of Stephanus, Gideon sped on, leaping from boulder to boulder in his mad endeavour to avoid the presence of the man against whom he had so terribly sinned. By some curious trick of thought his brother, thus unarmed, was more formidable to his maddened and guilty soul than had he come with a primed and loaded gun. A dread of some such fascination as the snake is said to exercise over his victim possessed him; he felt that once under his brother's eyes he would be bound and helpless. It was a terrible illustration of the dread which the malefactor sometimes feels towards the one he has wronged. Stephanus followed steadily, his heart full of its lofty purpose. He knew that his brother could not escape him now, that the moment he had longed for through the slow years was at hand. Serene in his trust, confident in his faith that Providence was directing his and Gideon's steps, and that neither could stumble until God's purpose had been fulfilled, he breasted the steep, rugged incline with a careful and methodical expenditure of energy. Soon the mountain narrowed to a wedge-shaped slope of an easier gradient, which culminated in a naked peak on each side of which a black gulf yawned. Under this, at a sheer depth which it made the senses dizzy to contemplate, the mighty river, now turbidly brimming from the heavy thunder-rains which had fallen upon its course, rolled down between fringes of tall green timber. When Gideon saw that he was trapped,—that in front of him and on either hand were perpendicular cliffs, and behind him the brother whose face he dreaded more than the face of Death, such a mighty cry of agony and despair issued from his deep chest that the dead, black chasms seemed for the instant to become peopled with lost souls. Then, nerved with the courage of despair he turned and faced his pursuer. 66 \n\nKeep back-keep back-\" he shouted hoarsely, \"or I will shoot you dead and follow you to Hell over the krantz.” \n\nYou cannot do it, my brother,\" called out \n\nStephanus; \"the shield of the Lord would turn the bullet aside and His hand would bear you up from the depths.\" \"Stand, I tell you.-Stand.-Another step and you are a dead man.” \n\nStephanus continued to approach, so Gideon lifted his gun and pulled the trigger, but the powder flashed in the pan. Stephanus never faltered, but walked composedly to where the desperate man was hastily endeavouring to reprime the gun with loose powder from his pocket. Stephanus laid his hand on his brother's shoulder and Gideon at once ceased in his attempt, the gun slipped from his nervous fingers and crashed upon the stones, and he sank, swooning, to the ground. When he regained consciousness Gideon found himself supported by the arms of his brother, whose eyes, deep with love and dimmed with pity, looked\nsteadily into his own. Then his sin, his anguish and his terror slipped from him like a cast-off garment, and for the first time in his manhood he wept."}

Gideon, also, had more than once thought of going to visit his sister-in-law, but the dread of again meeting what he had read in her eyes on the day of the trial held him back. It was currently known that Marta was in bad health and that Uncle\n\nDiederick had been called in to prescribe for her more than once. Thus the weary days dragged on through three weary years, but the stricken household kept no count of time. In material things Gideon prospered. Each season the years came with unusual regularity, and his flocks and herds increased until he became rich among his fellows. One day two figures were seen approaching from the direction of Stephanus' homestead. They turned out to be those of the blind girl, Elsie, and a very diminutive Bushman lad named Kanu, who had\ngrown up on the farm. Kanu had been captured as a child, years before, in the course of an exterminating raid upon some Bushman depredators at their stronghold in an almost inaccessible part of the \n\nRoggeveld Mountains. Kanu was about sixteen years of age. From her early childhood he had devoted himself to the service of the blind girl; at last his devotion had grown to positive worship. In Kanu's company Elsie would wander far and wide, over mountain and plain, in perfect safety. The Bushman had picked up a smattering of Dutch, but still spoke his own tongue fluently, for there were a number of semi-domesticated Bushman servants on the farm-captives from different raids. Such raids were, no doubt, sometimes rendered necessary by the plundering propensities of the pygmy sons of Ishmael, but there was another side of the question: where Bushmen were plentiful the \n\nBoers did not, as a rule, find it necessary to purchase slaves. The blind child was led by her guide to the front door of the house, which stood open. The day was hot and the family were sitting at table, trying to hurry through their dismal midday meal. Elsie crossed the threshold without knocking and stood at her Uncle's side. Her hair hung below her waist in a rich, yellow mass, and her eyes gleamed as they always did under the influence of excitement, and in appropriate light. The three sitting at the table sat and gazed at her in silent and startled surprise. \"Uncle Gideon,\" she said in a clear, piercing voice. \"Well,-\" said Gideon in a voice of forced roughness, \"what do you want?\" \"My mother bids me tell you that she is dying, and that you must come to her at once.\" Gideon rose to his feet, his face twitching. Elsie slowly turned, held out her hand for the guiding twig which Kanu extended to her, and stepped swiftly forth. Within the space of a few minutes Gideon sprang on a horse and galloped off in the direction of the homestead where the woman he loved lay dying. Marta sent one of the servants to fetch a span of oxen, and soon followed her husband, in a wagon. When Gideon arrived at Marta's homestead he could at once see that directions had been given as to the details of his reception. As he ascended the steep flight of steps which led to the voorhuis the door swayed open and revealed the weeping figure of \n\nSara, his niece. Walking on tip-toe she beckoned to him to follow her, and led the way to an inner room, the door of which stood ajar. Gideon entered, every nerve in his body tingling with apprehension. Sara softly closed the door behind him, and then he heard her retreating footsteps upon the clay floor of the passage. The dying woman lay propped up in bed, her cheeks flushed and her lips parted in a smile of loving welcome. She looked, for the moment, not more than twenty years of age."}

This was, of course, a very fortunate circumstance for the \n\nBushman. Had he ever been found and recognised, it is to be feared that a short shrift and a round bullet would have been his portion. CHAPTER XIV  \n\nALETTA, who had mentally and physically become grey like her surroundings, like a tree growing in a damp and dark corner which has long since given up the attempt to shine and bourgeon like its fellows that rejoice in the sunlight-received the news of Elsie's having been found with but a faint shock of surprise and satisfaction. Her perceptions had become dulled by the woe-laden years. Sara had, some two years previously, married a young farmer from an adjoining district. Uncle Diederick was glad of the opportunity of visiting Cape Town; he had heard of some wonderful new discoveries in the drug line, and he wanted to advance professionally with the times. His farming on joint behalf of himself and Stephanus had prospered. He felt that when his (at present) sleeping partner should be released, he, Uncle\n\nDiederick, would be able to build himself another \"hartebeeste house\" of ample proportions and sumptuous style, and devote his energies exclusively to the exercise of that healing art which his whole soul loved. Adrian had-being of a careful and frugal 125\nyoung. nature-begun acquiring stock when still very This had increased considerably, owing to a long series of excellent seasons and the exercise of careful management. Thus, he had recently found himself quite rich enough to start farming on his own account. When, however, he mooted this contingency with his father, Gideon at once offered him a full partnership in the farm as a going concern, leaving him the unrestricted management and only stipulating for the supply of teams of oxen and relays of horses for use on the hunting trips upon which he now spent by far the greater proportion of his time. Adrian at once closed with the offer. Whilst Uncle Diederick was making preparations for his trip the thought struck Adrian that the present might prove a good opportunity for him to visit that city which he had never yet seen. He felt that not alone could he make the journey pay its expenses, but that a handsome profit might be won by taking down a load of produce and bringing back another of supplies. So he overhauled his wagon, packed it with ostrich feathers and hides and then sent over to tell Uncle Diederick of his intention. Uncle Diederick had arranged to start on the third day following. Adrian's notification came in the form of a message sent through a Hottentot who was directed to enquire as to the hour of Uncle \n\nDiederick's intended departure, so that the wagon might arrive at the spot where the two roads from the respective homesteads met, at the same time. Up to this it had been understood that Jacomina was to remain behind and attend to any patients who might turn up. \"Pa,\" said that artless damsel, at supper, \"it will be very lonely here while you are away.\" A quizzical expression crinkled over the witheredapple-like visage of Uncle Diederick. Otherwise he impassively went on with his meal. Yes, and I have never seen Cape Town. Besides Elsie will be very lonely on the road if there is not another girl to talk to and look after her.\" After she had obtained her father's consent \n\nJacomina began at once making preparations for her trip. Her best frock was taken from the box and thoroughly overhauled, her smartest cappie and her newest veldschoens were laid ready for the morrow. A brooch of old workmanship and some other trinkets which had drifted into Uncle Diederick's coffers in the course of trade, and thence been annexed by his daughter as part of her share in the profits, were examined and judiciously selected from."}

Adrian gradually gathered her into his arms, and she allowed herself to be consoled. After a very few minutes a full understanding was arrived at; then Jacomina recovered herself with remarkable rapidity, and recollected that the wagons were far ahead. Adrian's shyness had by this time completely gone, so much so that Jacomina had some difficulty in getting him to make a start. In fact she had to escape from his arms by means of a subterfuge and dart away along the road. Her lover did not lose much time in following her. The course was interrupted by amatory interludes whenever the wayside boskage was propitious, so it was not before the outspanning took place that the wagons were reached. When the blushing pair stood before Uncle\n\nDiederick, that man of experiences did not need to have matters explained to him. \"Well, Jacomina,\" he said, \"I'll have to see about getting a wife myself now. But you need not be afraid on account of Aunt Emerencia; no one, who is not a fool, buys an old mare when he can get a young one for the same price.\" Uncle Diederick, who had not been to Cape Town since the days of his early youth, was very much impressed by everything he saw, but by nothing so much as the chemists' shops. He never got tired at gazing at the rows of bottles with their various coloured contents. He wandered from one drug emporium to another, until he made the acquaint-\nance of an affable young assistant who dispensed with an engaging air from behind a counter deeply laden with wondrous appliances and enticing compounds. This young man loved experiment for its own sake, and he had a wide field for the exercise of his hobby among the poorer classes, who usually came to him for panaceas for their minor ills. As Paul sat at the feet of Gamaliel, Uncle Diederick sat on a high-legged stool in the chemist's shop, drinking in greedily the lore which fell from the young man's lips, and making notes of the same in a tattered pocket-book, with a very stumpy pencil. Thus Uncle Diederick widened his medical knowledge considerably, until he felt that all worth knowing of the healing art was now at his command. The young man was the only one who suffered; his moral character became sadly deteriorated owing to the reverence with which Uncle Diederick regarded him, and the wrapt attention with which every essay of his was observed and recorded. Eventually Uncle Diederick placed an order worth about ten pounds at the shop, and obtained copious directions as to treatment of the different maladies which the contents of each bulky bottle might be expected to cure. The wagons had outspanned on the mountain slope, not far below the du Plessis' dwelling. Jacomina was much impressed at the luxuriousness of Elsie's surroundings and the quality of the stuff of which her garments were made. Gertrude and Helena tried to be civil and attentive to Jacomina and Adrian but-well, Jacomina was not long in seeing that the\ntwo town-bred girls were much more attractive than she was herself, and she did not care to appear at a disadvantage before her lover. Elsie she did not at first feel jealous of. As she expressed it to Adrian, the blind girl reminded her of the great peak at the head of the Tanqua valley, when it was covered with snow in winter. One day, however, she observed a look upon Adrian's face as he was regarding his cousin, which made her resolve to hurry on the wedding at all hazards. At the lower end of Plein Street was a shop, a mere contemplation of the contents of which filled Jacomina's soul with satisfaction. It was a large emporium, specially stocked and arranged for the purpose of supplying the needs of the farmers visiting the metropolis. At this establishment produce of all kinds was purchased, the value being usually taken out in goods-a double profit thus being secured by the management."}

In the short and broken sleep which visited his distracted brain the image of Stephanus as he had last seen him, haunted his dreams. The dauntless mien and the noble courage with which his brother had met his doom; the puzzled, pathetic expression upon the face of the blind child; the belated revelation of love combined with a terrifying appeal for forgiveness which he had read in the face of the woman for whom his passion had never died, swept over the field of his consciousness like clouds across a storm-swept sky. He felt no remorse for what he had done; on the contrary, his inability to enjoy the revenge he had long panted for, was the cause of redoubled resentment against his enemy. After greeting his family with forced cheerfulness, Gideon drank a cup of coffee and at once retired to bed, saying that he felt fatigued after his long journey. His wife, Aletta, was not deceived by his demeanour, but there was that in his face which caused her to forbear asking any questions. 38\nNext morning Gideon tried to avoid everybody, and it was not until midday that Aletta contrived to satisfy her painful suspense in regard to the result of the trial. He was then standing at the back of the wagon-house with bent head and an air of painful preoccupation. He did not hear her approaching footsteps. When she laid a hesitating hand upon his arm he started as though he had been struck, and looked at her with troubled eyes. \"Gideon,\" she said in a low and hurried tone- \"tell me about Stephanus.\" \"The wolf is in a trap;\" he said with a savage laugh\" for ten long years he will have to bite the door before it opens.' \"Ten years\" repeated Aletta in an awed whisper-\" poor Stephanus; I did not think it would have gone so hard with him.\" \"Aletta,\" he broke out wrathfully,\" are you taking the part of this wolf-this jackal in a man's skin, against me?\" \"6 \n\nNo-no-Gideon,—I do not take his part ;-but ten years is such a long time.—And I was thinking of \n\nMarta and the children; they will never see him again.\" \"And a good thing too. The murdering wild beast should have been hanged.\" In reality the wives of the brothers had, all through the weary course of the feud, been inclined to take the parts of their respective brothers-in-law against their husbands. Each, brought into daily contact with the black rancour displayed by her husband, had thought that the feeling could not possibly be so bad on the other side. Weary as had been the days to Aletta and Adrian, those which followed were wearier still. black cloud seemed to brood over the household. No one ever smiled. Each avoided the eyes of the others as though fearful of what the eyes might read or reveal. At each cheerless meal the silent, invisible presence of Stephanus seemed to take its seat; in the brightest sunlight its shadow seemed to darken the house."}

With a\nlast, pathetic effort of coquetry, the poor remnant of her once-beautiful hair was spread over her shoulder. Her hand appeared for an instant from under the bed-clothes; it looked like the hand of a skeleton in a livid glove. Gideon stood for a space looking into the smiling eyes of the woman whom he loved and sunning himself in their dying glow. The soiled years seemed to shrivel away like a burnt-up scroll, the past lived again in a borrowed glamour of lost joy that had never existed and his withered heart expanded like a rose in summer. With a long-drawn sigh he sank to his knees at the side of the bed and pressed his lips hurriedly upon the tress of silky hair; then he drew hurriedly back, startled at his own temerity. Marta turned her head slightly until she could see his face. Her eyes became softer with the dew of happiness and a smile hovered upon her lips. Then she spoke : \"Listen-I am dying ;—will you take my children and care for them?\" Gideon could not speak; he nodded his head and she proceeded : you \"I only knew you loved me when it was too late. I waited for you to speak-then they said that loved someone else—\"\n\nGideon's brain was busy recalling the long-past.

He got to know I loved you and he tried to kill you.— \n\nForgive him, if you can, for my sake—\" \"Wait, Marta,-I must tell you the truth—you are wrong—I must tell you the truth, even if it kills us both.\" The dying woman's lips became compressed, and the colour began to fade from her cheeks. Gideon tried to move so that her eyes, full of startled interrogatory and the pain of apprehension, might not rest upon his face whilst he made his confession, but they followed and held his spell-bound. Then in a hoarse, broken murmur he said: \"Stephanus shot me by accident-I accused him falsely because I hated him all my life.\" When he ceased speaking he drooped his head and hid his face among the bed-clothes next to \n\nMarta's shoulder. A slight shudder went through the woman's frame and then she ceased to breathe. Gideon kept his head bowed for a long time. When, by a torturing effort he lifted it, he saw a dead, ashen face lying on the pillow at his side, the face of an old woman who seemed to have died in sharp agony. When Gideon left the chamber of death he moved like a man in a dream. Mounting his horse mechanically he allowed the animal to stray homewards at a walk. He met the wagon in which Aletta was hurrying to the death-bed as fast as the team of oxen could bring her, but he passed it without recognition. The pathway led past the spring, the scene of the three-years' past tragedy. The day was hot and the horse turned aside to drink as was its wont. It was not until the animal paused and bent its head to the water that the rider recognised the locality. He was quite calm and the environment in which he found himself seemed appropriate to his mood. He dismounted when the horse had finished drinking, led it away to a spot where it could graze, a few paces distant, and then returned to the water-side. He went over the whole scene anew."}

You will remember it all by and by.\" ELSIE'S AWAKENING \n\n115 Helena drew the blind, frightened face down upon her generous breast, whilst Gertrude softly stroked the rigid hand which had seized one of hers with such a convulsive grasp as caused her acute pain. The blind girl's brain was reeling perilously near to madness. Like a flood came the memory of her journey and its purpose of the misery of disappointment, and the terror of the baboons. Her mind began anew at the flight from Elandsfontein, and retraced every painful step of the journey which came to such a tragic close in the inhospitable streets of the city. The whole pageant went through her consciousness in a whirling phantasmagoria. When she reached that stage of her adventures wherein she left the dwelling of the kind old coloured woman, she instinctively passed her hand over her knees to feel if she still wore the dress which had been lent her then. Again she ascended the rugged slopes of Table Mountain, with her ears filled with the horrid shouts of the persecuting boys. The longwaited-for Kanu seemed so imminent that she bent her ear to listen for his expected step in the sound of the rocking surf. Then her terror of the baboons returned upon her like a hurricane sweeping everything away in fury; she started up with a shriek and tried to rush away. \"Oh God, the baboons. Kanu-Kanu.\" \"Hush-hush, dear,\" said the soothing voice of \n\nHelena; \"you are safe with us; nothing can hurt you. Feel--we are holding you safely.\" The sudden rupture of the cells in the blind girl's brain, within which the terrors of that dire morning\nof four years back were pent, was like the breaking of the Seventh Seal. The shock almost unseated her reason. However, she gradually came to realise that she was with friends, whose tender touch brought comfort and a sense of safety. For the moment the last four years of her life were as effectually blotted out as though they had never been."}

When \n\nAletta told him of Elsie's return he started violently and turned deadly pale. He did not ask where his niece had been. As his wife descanted with nervous volubility upon the mystery, and explained how she had been unsuccessful in eliciting from Elsie any particulars of her flight and subsequent adventures, Gideon found himself wondering whether it would not be possible for him to get away secretly and return to the wilderness, thus to avoid meeting the accusing look of the blind eyes that he remembered so well and dreaded so sorely. But Elsie just then stepped softly into the room. \"Where is Uncle Gideon ?\" she said in a soft voice. Gideon gazed in speechless astonishment at Elsie. His apprehensive eye wandered over her graceful form and her pallid, beautiful face. He noticed how her figure had developed and how the gold had deepened in her hair. As Aletta tremblingly led her forward to the bench upon which Gideon was seated the unhappy man quailed and tried vainly to avoid the blind, accusing eyes, which seemed to seek his and to hold them when found. Elsie lifted her hands and placed them on his shoulders. \"Uncle Gideon,\" she said, \"my father sent me back to live with you until his release.\" Gideon murmured some unintelligible words. Elsie passed her hands lightly over his features. Aletta quietly left the room. \"Yes,\" said Elsie, \"you have suffered; I will try to comfort you, Uncle Gideon.\" A sense of immediate relief came over the unhappy man. It was now clear to him that Stephanus could not have told her the truth about the tragedy at the spring, or else she would never have met him and spoken to him as she did. So far it was well, but the fact of Stephanus not having taken her into his confidence was a proof of the implacability of his mind. But in an instant his mind rushed to another conclusion: this blind creature who loved her wronged father so utterly,-was it not certain that her desire for vengeance must be as keen as his? But he would balk them both by plunging again into the wilderness-so far, this time, that he would never be able to return. \"A good way to comfort one,\" he growled ungraciously, \"to wander away with a Bushman and make us run all over the country looking for you.\" \"Would you like to know, truly, why I went, Uncle Gideon ?\" \"Oh, as you are back all right now and have had enough to eat, wherever you have been, it does not matter; you can tell me some other time.—Only you must not do such a thing again.\" 'No, there will be no need for me to do the like again.\" Gideon left the room, feeling more and more puzzled.

This was the intention, previously unformulated, of finally leaving wife, home and everything else and trekking to some unknown spot far beyond the great, mysterious Gariep,—to some spot so distant that his brother's vengeance would not be able to reach him, and there spending the remnant of his miserable days. To do Gideon but justice, the strongest element in his dread of meeting Stephanus was not physical but moral. He felt he could not bear to confront the stern accusation which he pictured as arising in the injured man's piercing eyes."}

One thinks of a nun, despite the horrid stories sometimes told of convents, as of a woman saintly in appearance as well as by profession-she should be pale, austere, and thin; Sister \n\nKatherine, on the other hand, was plump of figure and rosy cheeked, fonder of mirth than of tears, and of a cheerful piety. In all respects she was the exact opposite of the nun as we are apt to think of her. She was also voluble exceedingly. Yet not foolish like most voluble persons who, so long as they can\nstill be talking, care not greatly what they say or who listens. In every respect she was unlike her brother, the Lieutenant, who lived with her. For while she was easy, he was stiff; while she was plump, he was thin; while she was merry, he was grave; while she was voluble, he was sparing of his words. But such opposites are common in families. George, for his part, took after his father's sister rather than his father. The good lady, espying me one day- 'twas on a Sunday, after dinner-wandering in melancholy mood about the place-there was little joy at home during those daysopened her window and hemmed, and bade me come in. 'I am alone,' she said, when I obeyed. Come in and let us have a comfortable crythat is, I will cry. I am alone. The Lieutenant has gone to the Crown and Anchor for his pipe and his glass. George-poor lad!has taken sculls across the river, and is now, I take it, sitting glum, all alone, in the Dock; and even that brings him no comfort, though he ought to think that it is worth—ay !—a\ngood six hundred pounds a-year. Think upon that! Six hundred pounds a-year for him, who was yesterday but a mate of an East Indiaman. And yet no happiness to go with it! What is fortune without happiness? His case is like a text for a sermon. Yesterday but a poor unconsidered swab of a third mate, whom nobody regarded; and to-day the rich and prosperous Owner of a Dock! 'Tis a change such as one may dream and fortune-tellers prophecy. He could wish for nothing better, and yet with it comes also this great misfortune. Poor boy! my heart bleeds for him. You will take a glass of my ginger, Nevill: you were always fond of a glass of good wine. The pity of it! The pity of it!' The pity of it!' I repeated. 'Sit down, Nevill. This bottle of ginger wine of my own making-I offer my friends nothing less-longs to have the cork out. Wait a little. It is a twelvemonth oldginger takes a whole twelvemonth to mellow.' She bustled about, and presently set on the table the bottle, a couple of glasses, and a plate of dried Smyrna figs. There, Nevill- 6\nand I only wish that Sylvia was here too.

To Sylvia's better health and George's better luck!' I drank the toast, sipping the wine slowly. One must not gulp ginger wine, or it will burn the throat and bring the tears into the eyes. Taken in sips, it is an excellent stomachic. 'Your mother's raisin is good, I admit, and in cowslip she has no equal,' said Sister Katherine, but think of this for ginger! And yet men must be yearning after port, and sighing because the war will keep claret off their tables!' The Sisters' houses are not so commodious as those of the Brothers, nor are they placed round a court or quadrangle. Yet they are comfortable, the rooms wainscotted, and the stairs ample.

On this night the trees were white with spring blossoms, and the air was fragrant with their delicate breath. It is in a garden--a garden of fruit-trees, as well as of vegetables and flowers-that we may most profitably meditate on the course of life and its meaning. This has been often set forth by wise men. Here, in spring, we see the earth awakening from its sleep, which is the type of death. A new year-a new life is begun. Thus life ever follows death, and\nafter death life begins anew. It is as if there were but one man, and he every night lying down and every morning again uprising. He does his work-between the morning and the evening and he dies. Then a new manwho is the same-is born again, with conditions of life all the better if the last man has done his work well. He, too, in his turn advances the work a little. And so on; now falling back a little, now advancing a little, until in time to come man shall be so strong, so long-lived, that he will look back with wonder even upon the polite age of George the Third, and ask himself how, being exposed to so many perils, he could ever have been happy even for one single moment. Can\n\nHeaven itself, by the Divine assistance, thus be reached? To this spot we were wont to repair by long use and custom. Naturally our feet turned towards the garden and the orchard. Here as children we could play, being both of an age, and here, when we grew older, we could walk and talk. It is one of those places in which, however great may be the noise\nST. KATHerine's BY THE TOWER \n\noutside, it seems always quiet. The lanes and narrow alleys of the Precinct were full of people who sang and laughed, quarrelled and reviled each other, shouted and fought, and made all the noises that delight a rude folk. Yet the noise came not into any part of the Hospital. From the river there still arose from some belated ship a yo-hoing and bawling, but we seemed to hear nothing—not even the firing of the ordnance from the \n\nTower or the salutes of the ships which arrived at Deptford Yard or sailed away. We walked there hand-in-hand without speech, but each knew very well what was in the heart of the other. Presently Sylvia stopped at the little door which opened upon the burying-ground. 'Let us leave the garden,' she said. 'Let us go into the burying-ground-here is spring, and that means love and hope. I have nothing more to do with spring. There are graves-and they mean dust and death.' She lifted the latch and we stepped out into the crowded graveyard behind the\nchurch. Here the stones, standing thick together, grey by day, were now silvery white in the moonlight or black in shadow. The grass grows long in summer, but it was now still short, and underfoot it was soft and damp. Among the graves Sylvia told me for the first time the truth of what had happened to her. Sylvia sat down on one of the tombs and threw back her hood. The evening breeze played in her light brown curls, and the moon made her blue eyes shine large and ghostly. It might have been a ghost among the graves. I believe it is not lucky to sit on a grave, but nobody, surely, could be more unlucky than my sister at that period. Brother,' she said, holding my hand, 'I am, indeed, the most miserable creature in the whole world.' 6 'It will pass, my dear. Everybody is agreed that it will go away.

'Selfishness,' said my friends, 'with the rich is more powerful than the sense of justice.' It certainly is; yet we made the greatest of all mistakes when we fondly imagined that those virtues which are feeble, even altogether lacking, in men of substance, education, and urbanity, must necessarily be conspicuous in those of ignorance, rudeness, and poverty. While I was thus drifting, as it were, along a current leading me into the perilous waters of conspiracy, an accident occurred which greatly accelerated my progress. Among the thousands of émigrés and exiles who crowded over during the first year was one named the\nMarquis de Rosnay, who came-why, I know not to live in the Precinct. He was very poor, but his pride equalled his poverty. He was old-past seventy years of age he had lived in England many years before the Revolution. I believe he had even been Ambassador at the Court of St. James's; he spoke \n\nEnglish clearly, if not fluently. As for his old friends, of whom he must have had many, for he spoke familiarly of the Court of George the Second, and of the great men of that time, he would not seek out any. He lived in this remote and obscure part of London in order to be concealed from their pity or their charity. One room in a small house belonging to the \n\nHospital-'twas in St. Katherine's Squaresufficed for him, and on what private resources he lived I cannot say. He was a beautiful old gentleman to look at, not tall, but upright still, not as yet bowed by his weight of years. He looked always as if he had that moment left the hands of his valet and his perruquier; his linen and his lace was of the whitest; his coat and waistcoat the most spotless; his face always calm, noble,\nand dignified. One could never at any time, and whatever the conversation, observe in him the least impatience or anger at the reverse of fortune which had transferred him from a great palace in the country to a little house in St. Katherine's. He preserved the grand manner in this retreat, and conversed with me as if he were still the Ambassador and I a young gentleman in whom he took a kindly interest. Yet, although his appearance and bearing were such that no one could presume upon the least liberty, his voice and his speech were as gentle and as sweet as those of any girl. He found me out; he made me talk to him; he drew me on gently, little by little, until I spoke freely of myself, my reading, and my opinions; he received my confidences with patience-never could I speak to any one freely as to the Marquis; he encouraged me. To this day I have never been able to learn what opinions he really held. Once he said to me: Young man, it is fifty years and more since I first heard discussions on these 6\n£ \n\nsubjects which now interest you-and the whole world—so deeply. I have sat at tables where Voltaire, Diderot, D'Alembert, even your Bolingbroke, freely discussed the sovereignty of the people. I have lived to see these ideas put in practice across the ocean. I have expected, a long time, to see it prevail in France, where there is more respect paid to reason and the art of logic than-perhaps -in Great Britain. It is interesting to have seen the ideas of one's youth actually carried out by my own people. If I was not so old that instruction comes too late it would be useful for me to observe the things which naturally follow when the people have assumed the sovereignty. As a natural result, I am here, and my estates-where are they?' He shrugged his shoulders and took a pinch of snuff."}

This, you will perceive,\nthrows a very different complexion upon the business. Most unfortunately, this confession or revelation was made to me the evening before the most disastrous day in my whole life, when I was deprived of all power to control what followed, even though my knowledge of what had happened gave me such power. Had it not been for this disaster, I should have laid the whole business before the Prebendary in the first place. The schoolmaster would have been cited before the \n\nChapter House of the Foundation: the wise woman would have been made to confess what she knew: George would have been told the whole truth and we should have seen then what would have happened next. I take it as unwise of me-though, Heaven knows, I acted for the best-to have delayed speaking to my sister for so long. I suffered a fortnight and more to pass by, hoping every day to see a change for the better. Finally, when there came no change, I resolved to appeal to her sisterly affection, and to pray her to tell me all that was in her mind. It was an evening late in the month of April M 2\nwhen I found my opportunity. The evening was soft and calm, the air was warm, though the season was as yet but little advanced. There was a gentle breeze from the west, the sky was clear. Sylvia had been sitting all day long in her chair, inanimate and pallid; there I found her, and proposed to her that she should come out with me to breathe for a little the freshness of the evening. Always docile, she rose and consented to go with me. So I wrapped her in her hood and led her forth, walking slowly, because she was now feeble. Outside she breathed with pleasure the fresh and fragrant air of the garden. Alas!' she sighed,' what things have fallen upon me since last I stood here!' The moon was already up, and now shone in great splendour upon the east end of the church, lighting up the broad and lofty window, and showing the tracery of the great \n\nCatherine wheel, emblem of the saint and martyr, patron of this place, which stands in the upper part. The narrow windows below glowed like burnished silver; the two towers\nof the north and south angles stood out against the clear sky in distinct outline; the whole north side of the church was in blackness. The Gothic pile, venerable always, but especially in the moonlight, filled the soul with admiration and awe; it has been a holy place from the days of King Stephen to our own time. For six hundred years and more the living have flocked hither for worship, and have brought their dead for burial; here \n\nQueens have knelt to offer gifts, and Princes have been buried. What matter for Queens and Princes? All the dead of six hundred years lie around and within this sacred pile. Save the Cathedral churches of St. Peter's and\n\nSt. Paul's, there is no more venerable or sacred spot than the ancient and beautiful church of \n\nSt. Katherine's by the Tower. We were standing in the Master's orchard, beside the Master's house, and behind the burying-ground of the Precinct. 'Tis a pleasant place in summer, and at all times when one can walk abroad and enjoy the warmth of the sun in a fenced garden sheltered from the wind. There are old fruit-trees in the\norchard-everything is old-apples and pears, cherries and medlars, and mulberries; peaches and vines are trained against the high wall at the back, which has a southern aspect-it is said that before the Reformation the Brothers made wine from their own grapes; there is a bowling green on that side nearest the house. Here from the time of \n\nKing Stephen downwards has that ancient game been played."}

Next week, or even to-morrow, they will have battled with, and, in a measure, choked the spirit of disgust, or homesickness, or weariness, with which they come back from play to work; but to-day nothing seems quite so hard in all the world as to turn from the hundred things that have interested and delighted them, and settle down to grammar, and philosophy, and algebra. Teachers and scholars alike are apt to feel the depression of such circumstances; and when you add to the other discomforts, that of a steady, pouring rain, with a sound of fall in every whiff of wind, you will understand that\n\nMarion was to have comparatively little help from outside influences. She felt the gloom in her heart deepen as the day went on. She was astonished and mortified at herself to find that the old feeling of irritability and sharpness still held her in grasp; she was not free from them, at least. Burdens. 53 Her tongue was as strongly tempted to be sarcastic, and her tone to be stern, as ever they had been. None of the scholars helped her. Those of them who were neither gloomy, nor listless, nor inclined to be cross, were simply silly; they laughed on every possible occasion, with or without an excuse; they devised ways and means to draw off the attention of these who made faint efforts to be studious; and, in short, were decidedly the most provoking of all the elements of the day. Marion found herself more than once curling her lip in the old sarcastic way at the inconsistencies and improprieties of those among her pupils who bore the name of Christian. During the long recess she tried to go away by herself, in the hope that her heart might quiet down, and rest itself on some of the new and solid ground on which she had so lately learned to tread. But they followed her: several of the teachers, in a gayety of mood, that was half affected to hide the homesickness of their hearts, and therefore infected no one else with a cheerful spirit. They were armed with a package of examination papers, given in by\nthose scholars who aspired to a higher grade. They loudly called on Marion for assistance. \"You haven't had a single examination class yet; then it is clearly your duty to help the afflicted. Bear ye one another's burdens,' you know.\" It was Miss Banks who said this, and she had barely escaped being Marion's intimate friend; as it was, she came nearer being familiar with her than with any other. She wondered now how it could have been that she had liked her! Her voice sounded so shrill and unwinning, and the quotation that she so glibly uttered was such a jar. However, she turned back with a wan attempt at a smile, and said: \"I shall have enough examination papers of my own before night. How do yours range?\" And she took half a dozen that were reached out to her. 66 They range precisely as if we had a parcel of idiots in our care. The blunders that these aspiring young ladies and gentlemen make in orthography are enough to set one's teeth on edge.\" 66 \n\nOrthography!\" said Marion, with a curling\nBurdens. 55 66 lip. They are years too old for any such commonplace as that; it must be history, at least. Here is Allie March struggling for the advanced history class, and I venture to say she doesn't know who was President four years ago.\" And then Marion suddenly remembered that\n\nAllie March was the one whom, in her glorified moments of only the day before she had aspired to help forward in her Christian life.

We never went to a ball in our lives, and we were never injured by dancing, so far as I can discover, and yet we have done a good deal of it.

How is she to discover what special point has been taken up by each teacher? As a bit of private experience, I think she will be a fortunate woman if she finds that any point at all has been reached in many of the classes. \"There is only now and then a teacher who believes that little children are capable of understanding the application of a story. I can't understand why, if that is the best method of managing a primary class, people take the trouble to have a separate room and another superintendent. Why don't they stay in the main department? I always thought that one of the special values of a separate room was that the lesson may be given in a distinct and natural tone of voice, and with illustrations and accompaniments that cannot be used, where many classes are together, without disturbing some of them. . \"If, on the other hand, the sub-teachers are not expected to give the lesson, but only to teach certain opening recitations, then you have the spectacle of employing a dozen or twenty persons to do the work of one. Then there's another thing; our room is not suited to the plan of subdivision, and there is only occasionally a room that has been built to order, which is- 99 \"On the whole, you do not at all believe in the plan of subdivision,\" Dr. Dennis said, laughing.

Those verses just held me; I thought about dancing, about all the times in which I had danced, and the people with whom I had danced, and the words we had said to each other, and I could not see that in any possible way could be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, or that it could be done heartily, as unto the Lord. I settled my own heart with those words; that for me to dance after I knew that whatever in word or deed I did, I was pledged to do heartily for the Lord, would be an impossibility.\" An absolute hush fell upon them all. Marion looked from one to the other of the flushed and eager faces, and then at the sweet drooping face of their little Flossy. \"We have spent our strength vainly,\" she said, at last. \"It is our privilege to get up higher; to look at all these things from the mount whereon God will let us stand if we want to climb.

These verses of Flossy's mean something, surely. What do they mean, is the question left for us to decide? After all, Ruth, I agree with you; it is a question that must be left to our judgment and common sense; only we are bound to strengthen our common sense and confirm our judgments in the light of the lamp that is promised as a guide to our feet.\" Almost nothing was said among them after that, except the commonplaces of good-nights.

If father were not within hearing I would, just to see what these finished young ladies would say.\" But she did not try it; and the evening passed, as so many evenings had, without an attempt on her part to carry out any of the thoughts which troubled her. She looked forward to one bit of work which she expected to fall to her share; at least she liked to call it work. That card-party to which she had been invited; she would be expected to attend in company with Mr. Wayne; she meant to decline, and her father would be surprised and a trifle annoyed, for it was at a place where, not liking the people well enough himself to be social, he desired his daughter to atone for his deficiency. But she would steadily refuse. She did not shrink from this effort as Flossy did; on the\ncontrary, she half enjoyed the thought of being a calm and composed martyr. But, quite to her discomfort, the martyrdom was not permitted; at least it took a different form. Mr. Wayne was obliged to be out of town, and sent profuse regrets, assuming that, of course, it would be a sore disappointment to her. Her father took sufficient notice of it to make one or two efforts to agreeably supply his place, and failing in that, assured his daughter that rather than have her disappointed, he would have planned to accompany her himself if he had known of Mr. Wayne's absence in time. The actual cross that it would have been to explain to her father that she did not desire to go, and the reasons therefor, she did not take up; but the occurrence served to annoy her. Two days afterward she was busy all the morning with her dressmaker, getting a special dress ready for a wedding among the upper circles. She had been hurried and worried, and was as nearly out of patience as her calmness ever allowed her to be. Still she remembered that it was the prayer-meeting evening, that she should see Dr. Dennis, and that he would be\nlikely to ask her about the people on that list. She ought to go that afternoon, and try what she could do. Once since her call on Dr. Dennis she had met him as he was going down Clinton Street, and he had turned and joined her for a few steps, while he said: \"I have been thinking about another friend of yours, that I should be very glad to see influenced in the right direction. His sister is trying, I presume; but other people's sisters sometimes have an influence. Young Mitchell, the doctor's son, is a young man of real promise; he ought to be on the Lord's side.\" \"You are mistaken in supposing him to be a friend of mine,\" Ruth said, with promptness and emphasis. “We have the most distant speaking acquaintance only, and I have a dislike for him amounting to absolute aversion.\" There was that in Ruth Erskine's voice when she chose to let it appear that said, \"My aversion is a very serious and disagreeable thing.\""}

Of course, special friends are an exception.\" And Col. Baker was well pleased to be ranked among the exceptions. Meantime the ringer was heralded. \"It is Dr. Dennis, sir. Shall I show him in here?\" \"I suppose so,\" Mr. Shipley said, gloomily, as one not well pleased; and he added, in under tone, \"What on earth can the man want?\" Meantime Col.

It so happened that Dr. Dennis' call was purely one of business; some item connected\nwith the financial portion of the church, which Dr. Dennis desired to report in a special sermon that was being prepared. Mr. Shipley, although he was so rarely an attendant at church, and made no secret of his indifference to the whole subject of personal religion, was yet a power in the financial world, and as such recognized and deferred to by the \n\nFirst Church. Dr. Dennis was in haste, and beyond a specially cordial greeting for Flossy, and an expression of satisfaction at her success with the class the previous Sabbath, he had no more to say, and Mr. Shipley soon had the pleasure of bowing him out, rejoicing in his heart, as he did so, that the clergyman was so prompt a man. \"He would have made a capital business man,\" he said, returning to his seat. \"I never come in contact with him that I don't notice a sort of executive ability about him that makes me think what a success he might have been.\" There was no one to ask whether that remark meant that he was at present supposed to be a failure.

My daughter, when she is in her father's house, is answerable to him, and not to Dr. Dennis, or any other divine.\" 66 \"I don't in the least understand what you are talking about,\" said mystified Flossy. \"Of what interest could it have been to Dr. Dennis what \n\nI am doing; and why should he have delivered a lecture?\" Col. Baker and Charlie Shipley exchanged\namused glances, and the former quoted, significantly: \"Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.\" Then he added, as Flossy still waited with questioning gaze: \"Why, Miss Flossy, of course you know that the clergy think cards are synonyms for the deadly sin, and that to hold one in one's hand is equivalent to being poisoned, body and soul?” “I am sure I did not know it. Why, I knew, of course, that gambling houses were not proper; but what is the harm in a game of cards?

In fact he had called this very evening on such an errand, but it was after Flossy had gone to her own church. So her first meeting with him since Chautauqua experiences was in that hall belonging to the First Church. \"Good-evening,\" he said, joining her without\n. the formality of a question as to whether it would be agreeable; his friendship was on too assured a footing for the need of that formality. \"You are more than usually devoted to the \n\nFirst Church, are you not? I saw you in the family pew this morning. I felt certain of being in time to take you to the South Side to-night. St. Stephen's Church has a grand choral service this evening.

Baker, in a calm and superior tone of voice: \"Thanks for your kindness, but I have decided to attend my own church service regularly after this, and would therefore not have been able to accompany you if I had been at home.\" But for Flossy such an explanation was simply dreadful. It was so natural, and would have been so easy, to have murmured a word of regret at her absence, and expressed disappointment in having missed the choral. Col.. Baker's Sabbath Evening. 75 But for that address to the children, given under the trees at Chautauqua, by Dr. Hurlbut, she would have said these smooth, sweet-sounding words as sweetly as usual, without a thought of conscience. But had not he shown her, as plainly as though he had looked down into her heart and seen it there, that these pleasant, courteous phrases which are so winning and so false were among her besetting sins? Had he not put her forever on her guard concerning them? Had she not promised to wage solemn war against the tendency to so sin with her graceful tongue? Yet how she dreaded the plain speaking! How would Marion's lips have curled over the idea of such a small matter as that being a cross! And yet Flossy could have been sweet and patient and tender to the listless, home-sick school-girls, and kissed away half their gloom, and thought it no cross at all. Verily there is a difference in these crosses, and verily, \"every heart knoweth its own bitterness.\" Col. Baker was loth to leave the subject: \"Aren't you being unusually devout to-day?\" he asked. \"I heard of you at Sabbath-school. 66\nI was certain after that effort, I should find you at home, resting. What spell came over you to give the First Church so much of your time?\" \"One would think, to hear you, that I never went to church on Sabbath evening,\" Flossy said. And then to a certain degree conscience triumphed. \"I have not been very often, it is true; but I intend to reform in that respect in the future. I mean to go whenever I can, and I mean to go always to the First Church.\" Col. Baker looked at her curiously in the moonlight. \"Is that an outgrowth of your experience in the woods?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" Flossy said simply and bravely. He longed to question further, to quiz her a little, but something in the tone of the monosyllable prevented. So he said: \"I am at least surprised at part of the decision. I thought part of the work of those gatherings was to teach fellowship and unity. Why should you desert other churches?\" \"There is no desertion about it."}

But the error that only faintly glimmered in Ruth's sentence was so mixed with solemn and helpful truth that she felt at a loss as to whether there was error at all, and so held her peace. CHAPTER XXII. REVIVAL. S the early autumn months slipped away, and touches of winter began to show around them, it became evident that a new feeling was stirring in the First Church. No need now to work for increased numbers at the prayer-meeting; at least there was not the need that formerly existed; the room was full, and the meetings solemn and earnest. The \n\nSpirit of God was hovering over the place. Drops of the coming shower were already beginning to fall. What was the cause of the quickened hearts? (355)\nWho knew save the Watcher on the tower in the eternal city? Was it because of the sudden, and solemn, and hopeless death occurring in the very center of what was called \"the first circles?\" Was it the spirit developed apparently by this death, showing itself in eager, indefatigable effort wherever Ruth Erskine went, with whomsoever she came in contact? Was it Marion Wilbur's new way of teaching, that included not only the intellect of her pupils, but looked beyond that, with loving word, for the empty soul? Was it Eurie Mitchell's patient way of taking up home work and care, that had been distasteful to her, and that she had shunned in days gone by? Was it Flossy Shipley's way of teaching the Sabbath-school lessons to \"those boys\" of hers? Was it the quickened sense which throbbed in the almost discouraged heart of the pastor whenever he came in contact with either of these four? Was it the patient, persistent, unassuming work of John Warden as he went about in the shop among his fellow-workmen, dropping an earnest word here, a pressing invitation there?"}

There is no 'thus saith the Lord' about it, any more than there is about having company, and going out to\ntea, and a dozen other things. We are to do in these matters what we think is right; and that, in my opinion, is all there is about it.\" \"Then you retire from the lists?\" Marion asked. \"Not a bit of it. I am just as emphatically of the opinion that there is no harm in dancing as \n\nI ever was. What I say is, that the Bible is silent on that herself.\" subject, leaving each to judge for \"As he thinketh in his heart, so is he,\" \" quoted Ruth. \"That is my verse, one of them; and I think it is unanswerable. If you, Marion, think it is wicked to dance, then you would be doing a wrong thing to dance; but, Eurie, believing it to be right and proper, has a right to dance. Each person as he thinks in his heart.\" \"Then, if I think in my heart that it is right to go skating on Sunday, it will be quite right for me to go? Is that the reasoning, Ruth?” \"No, of course; because it that instance you have the direct command, 'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.' 999 \"But who is going to prove to me in what way\nThe Discussion. 287 \n\nI should keep it holy? I may skate with very good thoughts in my heart, and feel that I am keeping the spirit of the command; and, if I think so in my heart, why, isn't it so?\" \"You know it isn't a parallel case,\" Ruth said, slightly nettled. \"Flossy, would you speak for a dollar?\" Eurie asked, suddenly turning to her. She had been utterly grave and silent during all this war of words, but, to judge from her face, by no means uninterested. She shook her head now, with a quiet smile. \"I know what I think,\" she said, \"but I don't want to speak yet; only I want to know, Ruth, about that verse; \"I found that, and thought about it. I couldn't see that it means what you think it does. I used to think in my very heart that joining the church, and trying to do about right, was all there was of religion; but I have found that I was wonderfully mistaken. Can't persons be honest, and yet be very much in the dark because they have not informed themselves?\" \"Why, dear me!\" said Marion, \"only see, Ruth, where your doctrine would lead you! What about the heathen women who think in their hearts that they do a good deed when they give their babies to the crocodiles?\""}

His mind continuing to be disturbed by the unhappy condition of the masses of the people, he applied himself, during the intervals of his work, to consider means for their elevation, and became convinced that sound education was the remedy for the many evils which infested society. To give effect to his theories, he converted his own house into an orphan asylum, and endeavored, by judicious blending of industrial, intellectual, and moral training, to afford a specimen of sound education, so contrived as to be practicable as a national scheme.

I, a. Although the general distribution of the phosphates of the alkalies in the nutrient fluids (there is 40 per cent. of them in the ash of the blood-cells; 28:4 per cent. of phosphoric acid and 23.5 of potash in the ash of cows milk; and about 70 per cent. of phosphoric acid in the ash of the yolk of egg) is in itself an indication of their importance, the exact nature of their functions is not understood. Liebig has specially drawn attention to the peculiar grouping of the acid and alkaline fluids of the animal body. The permanence of this grouping is maintained, especially in herbivorous animals, chiefly by the conversion, within the body, of alkaline and neutral phosphates into acid phosphates by the means above described. Moreover, all tissue-forming substances (the protein bodies) are so closely connected with phosphates, that they remain associated during the solution and subsequent re-precipitation of these substances; and the ash of developed tissues (e.g., muscle, lung, liver, etc.) always affords evidence that acid phosphates existed in the recent tissue; and, further, no exudation from the blood-vessels can undergo transformation into cells and fibres, i.e., become organized, unless, in addition to other conditions, phosphates are present. Another convincing proof of the share taken by the phosphates in the formation and functions of the tissue is the fact that, though herbivorous animals take up a very small quantity of phosphates in their food, and though their blood is very poor in these salts, their tissues contain as large a proportion of phosphates as the corresponding parts of Carnivora. Lastly, the fact that one equivalent of the alkaline phosphate of soda (2Na₂O·H₂O·Р₂O) possesses the property of absorbing as much carbonic acid as two equivalents of carbonate of soda leads to the belief that the power of attracting carbonic acid, which the serum of the blood possesses, is due at least as much to the phosphate as to the carbonate of soda; and that, consequently, phosphate of soda has an important part in the respiratory process. Phosphate of Lime occurs in the organism in two formsviz., as the neutral or basic phosphate, 3CaO PO, and the acid phosphate, 2CaO H,OP.O. The neutral phosphate occurs in all the solids and fluids of the body, but is most abundant in the bones, in which it amounts to about 57 per cent., and in the enamel of the teeth, 80 to 90 per cent. It is remarkable that a salt so perfectly insoluble in water as neutral phosphate of lime can be held in solution in the animal fluids. In some fluids, e.g., the blood, it is probably, in part at least, combined with albumen, with which it forms a soluble compound; while in other fluids, e.g., the urine, it is held in solution by a free acid or by certain salts (e.g., chloride of"}

Pop. (1891) 17,500, PIETISM. PIETISM: interesting and powerful religious movement in the Lutheran Church in Germany, during the last part of the 17th and first half of the 18th c. The term Pietists designates a religious party which, without forming a separate sect, had distinctive characteristics in opinion and in procedure. It is still applied to the same or like tendencies of opinion, feeling, and conduct. P. may be regarded as consisting in an exaltation of the importance of religious feeling and of godly practice, with a corresponding depreciation of doctrinal differences that do not concern the simple fundamental Christianity; and with a contempt for, or, at best, respectful indifference to, outward ecclesiastical arrangements. P. has been more or less strongly developed from time to time in all sections of the church; as the tendency toward it always exists in a large class of earnestly religious minds. This tendency has taken sometimes a disproportionate development. In the church of the middle ages, it was displayed in an endeavor to attain superior spirituality and purity by religious contemplation and asceticism; and many persons, consequently, embraced a monastic life. The Reformers, adopting the Augustinian doctrines, rejected this external mode of seeking deliverance from indwelling sin, and proclaimed the efficacy of faith in the sacrifice of Christ. But the' controversies which arose among them, and increased among their successors, gradually gave a too exclusively doctrinal and polemical character to the sermons and writings both of the Lutheran and of the Calvinistic divines, particularly in Germany; and a reaction ensued, not at all toward the Church of Rome, but in favor of a religion of pious feeling and good works, or of the heart and life. Disgust at the sectarian bitterness and exclusiveness which prevailed led even to an undervaluing of disputed points; thus the Pietism of Germany was generated and developed. Its origin is referred to a work, Vom wahren Christenthume, by John Arnd, 1605; to the Invitatio Fraternitatis Christi of John Val. Andreæ, 1617, both Lutherans; and to the writings of Cocceius, a C, v.), in the latter part of the 17th c., and to his friends and disciples. The name Pietists was given first in contempt to certain young docents in Leipzig, who began 1689 to give prelections on the New Test. both to students and to citizens, and to addict themselves to a meditative mode of life. Spener had held meetings somewhat similar in his own house when preacher at Frankfurt-on-the-Main, and in his writings had urged the necessity of a reform in the Prot. Church and theology. He and his followers dwelt much on the importance of studying the Scriptures rather than the symbolical books, on the unfitness of any unconverted or unregenerate person for the Christian ministry, on the right and duty of the laity to take part in the exercises of Christian assemblies, and on the necessity of a practical religion rather than a systematized doctrine.

Indies (C. purgans), now common in the W. Indies also, and other warm parts of the world, is a small tree or bush, with milky juice. It is used for fences in many tropical countries, and serves the purpose well, being much branched and of rapid growth. The seeds, though not unpleasant to the taste, abound in a very serid fixed oil, which makes them powerfully emetic and purgative, or in large doses poisonous, The expressed oil, called PHYSICS.

The Calotype process was patented by Fox Talbot 1841 it is sometimes called the Talbotype process. He had now so far perfected a photographic process that the steps in it remain practically the same to the present day, though the materials used differ to some extent. Talbot produced his negative by preparing paper on the surface with iodide of silver, subsequently washing it over with a mixture of nitrate of silver, with gallic and acetic acids, and then exposing it in the camera to the object that he wished to copy. The invisible image or picture thus obtained was developed by aceto-nitrate of silver and gallic acid, and fixed with bromide of potassium.

A thin, flat box with a sliding shutter, together called a plateholder,' contains the sensitized plate. Generally, plateholders are arranged to contain two plates: such are provided with two sliding shutters, one on each face. When the picture is focused, the screen is withdrawn, and the plateholder inserted in its place; the shutter is then drawn out, and the sensitized plate, which exactly occupies the place of the glass screen, being now exposed, receives the picture. In a brief time, which now varies from a fraction of one second to several seconds in a good light, the shutter is closed, and the plateholder returned to a dark room, where the plate is taken out and developed. For general purposes, it is desirable that the camera should be as portable as possible, consistent with strength; consequently it is made usually in the bellows form, so that it will fold into small space. The tripod stand which supports the camera also requires to be light and strong; and the legs may be very light, yet not shake with the wind, as no view involving time exposure (i.e., not instantaneous) can be taken except when the camera is perfectly steady.

When the Spartans, B.C. 448, restored to the Delphians the guardianship of the temple and treasures of Delphi, of which they had been deprived by the Phocians, the Athenians immediately marched an army thither, and reinstated the Phocians.

The position of Athens was critical. Pericles wisely declined to fight against all his enemies at once.

In the same way the milt was taken from the male. The pressing operation was repeated at intervals several times. The eggs were then well mixed with the milt, and the water changed so as to be constantly fresh. The fecundation being completed, the eggs were placed for security in a covered vessel. This was originally of zinc, perforated with small holes, and had a layer of gravel on the bottom. A limited number of eggs were inclosed in the box, and the box placed in a current of pure water and covered with pebbles, care being taken to let the water pass freely through, as it is necessary for the eggs to be slightly agitated. The hatching takes place in two to four months, the time depending on the nature of the water and other circumstances.

The process of amendment provided by the instrument, while not so difficult as to be impracticable, as was the case with the articles of confederation, has nevertheless proved too cumbersome to be resorted to unadvisedly. As a result the constitution has been but little changed by amendment. Of the fifteen amendments that have been passed, the first ten, often called the bill of rights, were passed at one time and might almost be counted as one; while the last three also, relating as they do to the same subject and growing out of the civil war, are really a unit; so that it is perhaps not inaccurate to say that the constitution has really been amended but four times. It has undergone development, but it has been principally through the process of judicial interpretation and through custom. Mr. Bryce has said of it, \"The constitution as a whole has stood and stands unshaken. The scales of power have continued to hang fairly even. The President has not corrupted and enslaved Congress; Congress has not paralyzed and cowed the President. . . . Neither the legislature nor the executive has for a moment threatened the liberties of the people. The States have not broken up the Union and the Union has not absorbed the States."}
