Code that allows the user to create questions that are individually designed rather than produced by a well-established automatic pipeline.

These may include

1. "textbook" questions that were actually formulated in period textbooks of arithmetic &c, 
2. "refusal" questions where the model should say it cannot answer,
3. "attribution" questions where the model is asked to identify period, genre, or author, 
4. and a generic category of "handcrafted" questions we can thoughtfully design with a variety of explicit aims. This will include handcrafted knowledge questions, multi-hop reasoning questions, and poetry generation tasks.
