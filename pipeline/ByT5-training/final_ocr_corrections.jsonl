Another point of analogy is found in the development of shoots or suckers from axillary buds at the base of Phoenix dactylifera, Chamarops humilis, and other palms of a soboliferous character. Further, where injury has occurred to the terminal bud, the axillary buds, usually dormant, are incited into growth by the abundance of nourishment which the former would have monopolized. Another mode of branching is produced by the development of numerous adventitious buds just below the apex. The latter will be shown to be common in certain genera. The particular way in which axillary and adventitious buds appear, and the character they give the plant when lengthened out into branches, differ in almost every genus. The branching in Borassus (dichotomous or whorled) is quite unlike that in Cocos (often simple forked), while again in Areca (erect, branched, or candelabral) it assumes ", "cer": 0.001951219512195122}

Why, he tells us that Doctor Scott and Mr. Newton were dissatisfied with a meeting which used to be held at Olney; and that some other Episcopal clergymen in England, had thought that the prayer meetings there, were of a bad tendency. Why did not our worthy Bishop bring some witnesses, to prove that prayer meetings, in this country, produced\nthe results which he has ascribed to them.
