      "passage": "Freights have also advanced in favor of steamship interests, which,\nwith higher prices in England for coal, have also caused an advance in\nthe price of coal at this port, to the benefit of the coal merchants\nand others interested in this important trade. At present the ruling\nprice for steam coal is 24s. per ton, deliverable from alongside of\ncoal hulks moored in the bay. As near as I have been able to\nascertain, the quantity of coal sold in this market during the past\nyear for supplying merchant steam vessels has amounted to about\n508,000 tons, which is an increase of about 20,000 tons over the year\n1887. Notwithstanding that plans have already been submitted to the British\ngovernment for the construction of a dry dock in Gibraltar, the matter\nremains somewhat in suspense, since it meets with some opposition on\nthe part of the British government, which, in face of the European\nfever for general arming, seems more inclined to utilize in another\nform the expense which such a work would entail upon the imperial\ngovernment, by replacing the obsolete ordnance recently removed from\nthis fortress and substituting new defenses and guns of the most\napproved patterns, a matter which has evidently been receiving, for\nsome time past, the special attention of the British military\nauthorities, not doubting that the recent visit to the fortress of the\nDuke of Cambridge has had some connection with it. In fact, it is\nreported that the duke has already expressed the opinion that this\nfortress requires a larger number of artillerymen than are quartered\nhere at present to man its batteries, and it would seem that this\nrecommendation is likely to be carried out. It is yet somewhat too early to venture an opinion regarding the\ngrowing crops of cereals in this Spanish neighborhood, but the\nagricultural and manufacturing interests in Spain have suffered so\nmuch in the past years that the general feeling in Spain continues to\ntend toward establishing increased restrictions against foreign\ncompetition in her home markets. There is every probability that the\nprovinces of Malaga and Granada may shortly be granted the privilege\nof cultivating the tobacco plant under government supervision, as an\nessay. If properly managed, it may form an important and lucrative\nbusiness for those interested in land and agricultural pursuits. After many consecutive years of heavy outlays, difficulties, and\nconstant disappointments, a new English company has recently succeeded\nin commencing the construction of a railway from the neighboring\nSpanish town of Algeciras to join, via Ronda, the railway station of\nBobadilla, on the railroad line toward Malaga. It is presumed that\nwhen this railroad will be in running order it will greatly benefit\nthis community, especially if the Spanish government should decide to\nestablish custom houses at Algeciras and the Spanish lines outside the\ngates of this fortress, similar to those existing on the frontiers of\nFrance and Portugal. That some idea may be formed of the constant important daily\nintercourse which exists between this fortress and Spain, I may state\nthat late police statistics show that 1,887,617 passes were issued to\nvisitors entering this fortress on daily permits during the year 1888,\n1,608,004 entering by the land route and 279,613 by sea. I must,\nhowever, observe that the larger portion of these visitors consists of\nlaborers, coal heavers, market people, and others engaged in general\ntraffic. A new industry in cork has lately sprung up, in which leading Spanish\nand native commercial firms in Gibraltar are directly interested to a\nconsiderable extent.",

      "passage": "The method was carried out as above\nwith four samples of American petroleums, Colorado oil from Florence,\nCol.; Warren County oil from Wing Well, Warren, Pa.; Washington oil\nfrom Washington County, Pa.; Middle District oil from Butler County,\nPa., all furnished by Professor Sadtler. They were very different in physical properties and in appearance, the\nColorado oil being a much heavier oil than the others and the\nWashington oil being an amber oil, while the other two were of the\nordinary dark green color and consistence. The losses on distillation\nto 200\u00b0 C. were very different, being about one-tenth in the case of\nthe Colorado oil and nearly one-half in the case of the others. The\npercentages of partially refined proto-paraffine in the four reduced\noils (all below 200\u00b0 C. off) were as follows: for the Colorado oil,\n23.9 per cent. ; for the Warren oil, 26.5 per cent. ; for the Washington\noil, 26.6 per cent. ; and for the Middle District oil, 28.2 per cent. The question now arises, What value has this determination of the\nproto-paraffine which may exist in an oil? As before said, a portion\nof the paraffine is always decomposed in distillation at temperatures\nsufficiently high to drive over the paraffine oils, so the yield of\npyro-paraffine is always less than the proto-paraffine shown to be\npresent originally. Zaloziecki found this in the case of the several\nGalician oils he examined. Corresponding to the 4.6, 5.8 and 6.5 per\ncent. of proto-paraffine in the several oils he obtained 2.18, 2.65\nand 2.35 per cent., respectively, of pyro-paraffine. For the present, however, the extraction of proto-paraffine on a large\nscale by means of such solvents as amyl and ethyl alcohols is out of\nthe question on account of their cost. A distillation, under reduced\npressure and with superheated steam, would, however, prevent much of\nthe decomposition of the original proto-paraffine and increase the\nyield of pyro-paraffine. This study of Zaloziecki's method and the examination of American oils\nwas suggested by Professor Sadtler and carried out in his laboratory. *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTRANSMISSION OF PRESSURE IN FLUIDS. By ALBERT B. PORTER. The young student of physics occasionally has difficulty in grasping\nthe laws of pressure in fluids. His every day experience has taught\nhim that a push against a solid body causes it to push in the same\ndirection, and he often receives with some doubt the statement that\npressure applied to a fluid is transmitted equally in every direction. The experiments ordinarily shown in illustration of this principle\nprove that pressure is transmitted in all directions, but do not prove\nthe equality of transmission, and in spite of all the text books may\ntell him, the student is apt to cling to the idea that a downward\npressure applied to a liquid is more apt to burst the bottom than the\nside of the containing vessel. [Illustration: Figs. 1. and 2.] The little piece of apparatus shown in Fig. 1 was designed to furnish\na clear demonstration of the principle under consideration.",

In the meantime, Norah, the waitress, had admitted Nurse Hummel and her\ncharge, and poor Janet was heavy-heartedly climbing the long flight of\nstairs, without a voice to hail her coming. \u201cWe always meet people\nat home, Mrs. Hummel,\u201d she said at last, in a trembling voice, as\nshe paused at the landing to turn back to her guide, following with\nshortened breath. \u201cAren\u2019t they glad to see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat nonsense; just nonsense!\u201d declared Nurse Hummel, with the\nincrease of accent always perceptible when she was moved. \u201cThere iss\ndifferent customs, that\u2019s all.

Nurse Hummel opened the door. \u201cMy dears,\u201d she said, \u201chere iss your\ncousin, quite safe, und as glad to see you as you are to see her.\u201d And\nshe gently pushed Janet past her toward her relatives. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d said Gladys, in her most grown-up, and, as she fondly\nflattered herself, most elegant air. \u201cI hope you are not too tired\nafter your journey.\u201d With which enthusiastic speech of welcome she bent\ngracefully forward and lightly pecked Janet\u2019s cheek, apparently not\nseeing that the fresh young lips were ready to be met by hers. Now Gladys\u2019s affectations always exasperated Gwen beyond bearing, no\nmatter what called them forth, and she was really sorry for her cousin,\nwho looked as bewildered as hurt by this piece of nonsense. So it was\na commingling of temper and kindliness which made her own manner more\nthan usually simple and hearty as she put her arms around Janet and\nkissed her, saying, \u201cYou look very nice, Janet, and I hope you will\nlike New York and us.\u201d\n\nJanet raised her wet eyes to the tall girl above her, returning the\nkiss with warmth and interest. \u201cYou\u2019re Gwen, the clever one; I am\nsure I shall just love you,\u201d she said, and Gwen smiled with sincere\npleasure. \u201cHallo, Jack! hallo, Viva!\u201d cried Janet, partly restored to\ncheerfulness by Gwen\u2019s welcome, and glad to display her ready knowledge\nof her family. \u201cCome out here, and let me see you better.

The Grahams drew up in line outside the window, wiping away tears with\none hand as they waved the other, and made futile efforts to speak to\nJan through the double glass. At last the wheels moved, the train got into motion, and rolled slowly\nout of the station. Jan knelt on the seat, and pressed her wet face against the glass,\ncrying, though they whom she was leaving behind could not hear her,\n\u201cGood-by, good-by!\u201d\n\nThe last glimpse they had of Jan was a rainbow one, tears running down\nher cheeks, while her lips smiled at them.

      "passage": "\"It doesn't seem to have changed much,\" said the man to himself. He worked his way round, like one quite familiar with the route he\nfollowed, till at length he drew near the same quiet country road whence\nhe had started. This time he stopped for a few minutes in the thickest\nshadow and scanned each dim circle of radiance ahead. Nobody seemed now\nto be within the rays of the lamps or to be moving in the darkness\nbetween. He went on warily till he had come nearly to the same open gate\nwhere he had paused before, and then there fell upon his ears the sound\nof steps behind him and he stopped again and looked sharply over his\nshoulder. Somebody was following, but at a little distance off, and after\nhesitating for an instant, he seemed to make up his mind to risk it, and\nturned swiftly and stealthily through the gates. A short drive of some\npretentions ran between trees and then curved round towards the house,\nbut there was no lodge or any sign of a possible watcher, and the man\nadvanced for a few yards swiftly and confidently enough. And then he\nstopped abruptly. Under the shade of the trees the drive ahead was pitch\ndark, but footsteps and voices were certainly coming from the house. In\nan instant he had vanished into the belt of plantation along one side of\nthe drive. The footsteps and voices ceased, and then the steps began again, timidly\nat first and then hurriedly. The belt of shrubs and trees was just thick\nenough to hide a man perfectly on a moonless cloudy night like this. Yet\non either side the watcher could see enough of what was beyond to note\nthat he stood between the dark drive on one hand and a lighter space of\nopen garden on the other, and he could even catch a glimpse of the\nhouse against the sky. Light shone brightly from the fanlight over the\nfront door, and less distinctly from one window upstairs and through the\nslats of a blind in a downstairs room. For a moment he looked in that\ndirection and then intently watched the drive. The footsteps by this time were almost on the run. The vague forms of\ntwo women passed swiftly and he could see their faces dimly turned\ntowards him as they hurried by. They passed through the gates and were\ngone, and then a minute later men's voices in the road cried out a\ngreeting. And after that the silence fell profound. II\n\nTHE PROCURATOR FISCAL\n\n\nThe procurator fiscal breakfasted at 8.30, punctually, and at 8.30\nas usual he entered his severely upholstered dining-room and shut th\ndoor behind him. The windows looked into a spacious garden with a belt\nof trees leading up to the house from the gate, and this morning Mr.\nRattar, who was a machine for habit, departed in one trifling particular\nfrom his invariable routine. Instead of sitting straight down to the\nbusiness of breakfasting, he stood for a minute or two at the window\ngazing into the garden, and then he came to the table very thoughtfully. No man in that northern county was better known or more widely\nrespected than Mr. Simon Rattar. In person, he was a thickset man of\nmiddle height and elderly middle age, with cold steady eyes and\ngrizzled hair. His clean shaved face was chiefly remarkable for the\nhardness of his tight-shut mouth, and the obstinacy of the chin beneath\nit.",

Whether or not the schools\nthus frequented at Oxford were mainly founded by the Benedictines, as\nhas been maintained, and whether or not they were mainly conducted\nby teachers from Paris, they assuredly existed, and constituted an\nUniversity in all but the name. [Sidenote: Connection of Oxford with the University of Paris]\n\nIt is no longer doubtful that, in their earliest stage, the schools of\nOxford owed much to those of Paris, then in a far more advanced state\nof development, though not formally incorporated into an \u2018University\u2019\nuntil early in the thirteenth century. William of Champeaux had opened\na school of logic at Paris so far back as 1109. His pupil, Abelard,\nfollowed him; and the fame of Abelard himself was far surpassed by\nthat of Peter Lombard, whose text-book of \u2018Sentences\u2019 became the\nphilosophical Bible of the Middle Ages. Students flocked in from all\nparts of Europe; lectures multiplied, not only in one faculty, as at\nBologna or Salerno, but in every branch of medi\u00e6val study, especially\nin those comprised under \u2018Arts;\u2019 a system of exercises, degrees,\nacademical discipline, and even college life, was gradually matured;\nand when Philip Augustus gave the new academical guild his royal\napproval, it was already in a condition of vigorous activity. In this\nsense, the growth of the University of Paris was spontaneous. Like that\nof Oxford, it was originally nothing but an association of teachers\nunited by mutual interest; but, like all medi\u00e6val institutions, it\ngrew up under Church authority. It had originally sprung from the\ncathedral school of Notre-Dame; the ecclesiastical chancellor of\nParis claimed a paramount jurisdiction over it, which, however, was\nconstantly resisted by the University, not without support from the\nCourt of Rome; and the validity of its highest degrees was derived from\nthe sanction of the Pope himself. Considering the links which bound\nEngland to France, through Normandy and her other French provinces, as\nwell as the intellectual ascendency of Paris over Western Europe, it is\nnatural that Oxford should have borrowed many features of her internal\nregulations from this source, though it cannot be affirmed with\ncertainty that she did so. The presumption is strongly confirmed by the\nundoubted fact that the \u2018English nation\u2019 was one of the four \u2018nations\u2019\ninto which the students of Paris were divided, the Normans forming\nanother distinct nation by themselves. Leland tells us that young\nEnglishmen who then aspired to a high education got their schooling,\nas we should call it, at Oxford, but their college training at Paris,\nand Anthony Wood gives a list of eminent Oxonians who had studied at\nParis, including the names of Giraldus Cambrensis, Robert Pulleyne,\nRobert Grosteste, Roger Bacon, and Stephen Langton.",

[Sidenote: Superiority of colleges in discipline and tuition]\n\nIn such a state of society colleges offered not only a tranquil retreat\nto adult scholars, but also a safe and well-regulated home to younger\nstudents attending courses of lectures in the schools. The early\nfounders, it is true, did not design them to be mainly educational\nseminaries for the general youth of the country, and probably expected\ntheir inmates to obtain much of their instruction outside the walls\nof the college. But the statutes of Merton prove conclusively that\n\u2018Scholars\u2019[3] on admission were supposed to be of about the same age\nas modern freshmen, and to need rudimentary teaching, while express\nprovision was made for the reception of mere schoolboys. Doubtless, for\nat least two centuries after the institution of colleges, their members\nwere greatly outnumbered by those of halls, and the system which in\nthe fifteenth century triumphed over the rivalry of private hostels\nmay be more properly called aularian than collegiate. Nevertheless,\nthe superiority of colleges as boarding-houses for students inevitably\nmade itself felt from the very first. Humble as their buildings and\ndomestic arrangements may originally have been, they were imposing and\nluxurious by contrast with those of lodging-houses or halls. Their\nendowments enabled them to maintain a standard of decency and comfort\nin itself conducive to study; their statutes ensured regularity of\ndiscipline; their corporate privileges and rights of self-government\nimparted a dignity and security to all connected with them; the example\nand authority of their elder fellows, mostly engaged in scholastic\nor scientific research, if not in vigorous lecturing, cannot have\nbeen wholly lost upon the juniors. In Merton, and probably in other\ncolleges, disputations were carried on as in the University schools;\nattendance at Divine service was a statutable obligation; students\nwere not allowed to go about the streets unless accompanied by a\nMaster of Arts; in the dormitories the seniors were invested with\na kind of monitorial authority over the rest; and misconduct was\npunishable with expulsion. By degrees, some of the halls came into the\npossession and under the control of colleges, which might naturally\nelect the most promising of their inmates to scholarships. No wonder\nthat, however weak numerically, the seven colleges founded before the\nend of the fourteenth century produced an immense proportion of the\nmen who adorned that age by their learning and virtues. [4] Thus, out\nof eighteen vice-chancellors who can be identified as having filled\nthat office in the fourteenth century, five at least were members\nof Merton College, two of Oriel, and one of Queen\u2019s. Of sixty-four\nproctors known to have been elected during the same century, twenty-two\nat least were members of Merton, eight of Oriel, four of Balliol, and\none of University, Exeter, Queen\u2019s, and New College respectively,\nwhile it is probable that others, of whom nothing definite is known,\nreally belonged to one of the seven ancient colleges. Considering how\nlargely the non-collegiate population of the University outnumbered\nthese small collegiate bodies, it is a very significant fact that so\nmany vice-chancellors and proctors should have been chosen from them\nin days when election to both these offices was entirely free.",

CHAPTER III. PROGRESS OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. [Sidenote: Europe in the fourteenth century]\n\nThe fourteenth century deserves to be regarded as the most progressive\nand eventful in the history of the Middle Ages. All the kingdoms of\nEurope were engaged in wars, for the most part destitute of permanent\nresults, yet the work of civilisation went forward with unbroken\nsteadiness and rapidity. The Spanish monarchies of Castile and Arragon\ncontinued their long struggle for supremacy with each other, and for\nnational existence with the Mohammedan power at Granada. Germany was\ndistracted by civil wars and double imperial elections; Italy was torn\nasunder by the factions of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. The usurpation\nand avarice of the Roman Court produced an all but general revolt\nagainst Papal authority; the seat of the Holy See was transferred\nfor sixty years to Avignon, and the return of the Pope to Rome was\nfollowed by \u2018the Great Schism,\u2019 which lasted fifty years longer; Russia\nwas subject to the Khan of Kipchak until its southern provinces were\noverrun by the hordes of Timur; Poland and Hungary were exhausting\ntheir strength in expeditions against their neighbours or against\nVenice, while the Ottoman Turks were advancing into the heart of\nEastern Europe. England was entering upon its purely dynastic crusades\nfor the possession of the Scotch and French crowns, which, fruitful\nas they were in military glory, diverted the energies of the nation,\nwasted its resources, and retarded its internal development for several\ngenerations. Nevertheless, literature, art, and education flourished\nmarvellously in the midst of the storms which racked European society. Ancient learning was revived in Italy chiefly by the influence of\nPetrarch and Boccaccio; Dante became the father of modern Italian\npoetry; Cimabue and his pupils founded the Italian school of painting;\nscholastic philosophy culminated and gave place to a more independent\nspirit of inquiry; scientific research first began to emancipate\nitself from magical arts; Roman law extended its dominion everywhere\nexcept in England, where, however, Chaucer and Wyclif gave the first\npowerful impulse to native English thought; free thinking in politics\nand religion penetrated deeply into the popular mind, and increasing\nrefinement of manners kept pace with the growth of trade and industry. Universities sprang up one after another\u2014in France, in Spain, in Italy,\nin Poland, in Hungary, in Austria, and in Germany; nor is it unduly\nrash to surmise that, if the invention of printing could have been\nanticipated by a century, the Renaissance and the Reformation itself\nmight have preceded the capture of Constantinople and the discovery of\nAmerica.",

      "passage": "[Sidenote: Foundation of New College]\n\nThe foundation of New College by William of Wykeham, bishop of\nWinchester, in 1379, has been held to mark a new departure in\ncollegiate history. Like Walter de Merton, William of Wykeham had\nfilled various high offices of State, including that of chancellor, and\nis well known as the designer of several great architectural works. His main object in founding the College of \u2018St. Mary of Winchester in\nOxford,\u2019 since known as New College, is clearly stated in his charter. It was to repair \u2018the scarcity of scholars in the nation, having been\nswept away by great pestilences and wars.\u2019 Accordingly, in 1379, he\nobtained a license from Richard II. to found a college \u2018for seventy\nscholars studying in the faculties,\u2019 all of whom were to have passed\nthrough his other college for boys at Winchester itself. These scholars\nwere to be \u2018poor indigent clerks,\u2019 sufficiently taught in grammar, and\nunder twenty years of age. Ten were to study civil and ten canon law;\nthe remaining fifty were to study the Arts, or philosophy and theology,\nthough two of these might be specially permitted to devote themselves\nto astronomy, and two to medicine. But the claim of William of Wykeham\nto be considered the second founder of the college-system depends less\non any notable peculiarity in his statutes than on the grandeur and\nregularity of the buildings which he erected on a site then vacant, and\nfound by a jury to be infested by malefactors, murderers, and thieves,\nas well as the scene of other public nuisances. The noble quadrangle,\nof which the scholars took possession on the 14th of April, 1386,\nhaving already been lodged in Hert Hall and other tenements, doubtless\nserved as the model for all the later colleges, and the supremacy of\ncolleges over halls may fitly be dated from the end of the fourteenth\ncentury, when New College was the most imposing centre of collegiate\nlife. [Sidenote: European influence of Oxford in the fourteenth century]\n\nThe importance of Oxford in the eyes of Europe was increased during\nthe fourteenth century by two causes, the decline of the University\nof Paris, and the vigorous protest of Oxford schoolmen against the\nspiritual despotism of the Papacy, discredited by its subjection to\nFrench influence at Avignon. The former of these causes was, in fact,\nnearly connected with the latter. The University of Paris had owed much\nto Papal encouragement and protection, but it had always struggled\nfor corporate independence, and when, in 1316, it stooped to solicit\nthe patronage of John XXII., by submitting to him a list of candidates\nfor preferment, it forfeited its unique position in the estimation of\nEuropean scholars, then a small but united brotherhood. On the other\nhand, it was an English Franciscan of Oxford\u2014William of Occham\u2014who\nnot only challenged the supremacy of the Pope, but \u2018proclaimed the\nseverance of logic from theology.\u2019 The assertion of this bold paradox,\naggravated by the aggressive Nominalism of its author, nearly cost him\nhis life, for he was imprisoned by the Pope\u2019s order at Avignon, and\nonly escaped death by taking refuge at Munich with the Emperor Louis\nof Bavaria. His doctrines, however, found wide acceptance at Oxford,\nand paved the way for the far deeper revolution in ideas of which John\nWyclif was the pioneer.",

      "passage": "The eccentricities of Bohemia were then but\nslight exaggerations of a universal spiritual ferment, though, after the\ngood wine was made, a later and decadent Bohemia artificially reproduced\nthe symptoms of a process that was formerly natural and necessary. _Le\nmal romantique_, _le mal du si\u00e8cle_, are common phrases upon the lips of\nFrench critics, who to-day affect to treat with contempt what was, after\nall, a new Renaissance. Without adopting their attitude, it must be\nadmitted that, inestimable as were its results, it was an alarming\nconvulsion. The English took it in a milder and earlier form. Its most\nextreme manifestation, Byron and the \"Satanic\" school, was a thing of\nthe past before 1830. But the French were thoroughly and virulently\naffected, and exhibited all the most violent symptoms. We may best begin, perhaps, by looking at a particular \"subject,\" to use\na medical phrase, in the correspondence of J.-J. Amp\u00e8re, son of the\ngreat scientist. The younger Amp\u00e8re, after a violent adoration of Madame\nR\u00e9camier, who was old enough to be his mother, settled down into a most\nrespectable and successful man of letters, and he was never in any sense\na Bohemian. He was a well-educated and perfectly normal man, so that the\nravages of _le mal du si\u00e8cle_ may be well judged when he writes to his\nfriend, Jules Bastide, in 1820:\n\n     \"My dear Jules, last week the feeling of malediction was upon me,\n     round me, within me. I owe this to Lord Byron; I read through twice\n     at a sitting the English 'Manfred.' Never, never in my life has\n     anything I have read overwhelmed me as that did; it has made me\n     ill. On Sunday I went to see the sunset upon the Place de\n     l'Esplanade; it was as threatening as the fires of hell. I went\n     into the church, where the faithful were peacefully chanting the\n     Hallelujah of the Resurrection. Leaning against a column, I looked\n     at them with disdain and envy.\" Two months later Jules Bastide delivered his soul in a similar strain:\n\n     \"I feel that the slightest emotions might send me mad or kill me. The evening of our parting I opened at random a volume of Madame\n     de Sta\u00ebl and read the dream of Jean Paul. When I came to that\n     terrible line, 'Christ, nous n'avons point de p\u00e8re,' a shudder\n     seized me. An hour later I had a fever; it lasted a fortnight.\" Another friend wrote to Amp\u00e8re in 1824:\n\n     \"All my ideas turn towards Africa.... Is it solitude that I seek in\n     Africa? Yes, but it is not only that; it is the desert, the\n     palm-tree, the musk-rose, the Arab! A romanesque and _barbaresque_\n     future is what ravishes me.\" In 1825 Amp\u00e8re, then twenty-five years old, wrote to Madame R\u00e9camier:\n\n     \"Return, for my life is no longer tolerable without you; my spirit\n     is wholly employed in trying to _support_ the emptiness of my\n     days.\"",

      "passage": "How they would have rattled a sword and clanked a\nspur, how defiantly tilted their plume, how breathlessly loved and how\ndestructively fought! Why did they not live in the joyous time when\nevery minute brought an adventure instead of spilling one more drop from\nthe cup of _ennui_, and when a man shaped his own ends according to his\npassions, throwing a curse to the poor and a madrigal to the fair? Then,\nall their life was not grey. Splendour of colour with ample grace of\nform decked out existence like a picture by Veronese. Costly satin vied\nwith magnificent brocade; all was a riot of velvet and purple dyes, fur\nand old lace; drinking cups, worthy of giants, chiselled by a Cellini,\noffered wine worthy of the gods; swords were masterpieces of the finest\nToledo; jewelled harness caparisoned fleet Arab horses; feasts were\nGargantuan, jests more than Rabelaisian; and all this wonderful wealth\nof glittering colour was thrown into magnificent relief against the\nsolemnity of antique battlements and the sombre shadows of Gothic\narchitecture. This, apart from all innovations of dramatic form, was the\nsecret of the delirious popularity of \"Hernani,\" \"Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia,\" \"Le\nRoi s'amuse,\" and the \"Tour de Nesle,\" and of the craze for historical\nnovels, verses in baroque metres, slouch hats _\u00e0 la Buridan_, velvet\npourpoints, daggers, mysterious draperies and massive chests, drinking\ncups made out of skulls, and illuminated breviaries of which Gautier\nmakes such fun in \"Les Jeunes France.\" To it we owe Balzac's splendid\n\"Contes Drolatiques,\" Lassailly's \"Roueries de Trialph,\" and Roger de\nBeauvoir's \"L'\u00c9colier de Cluny.\" Gautier in his early poems was as\nromanesque as any of his \"Jeune France,\" as those who know his early\npoems must admit. \"D\u00e9bauche\" is a frank orgy, and \"Albertus\" is a gem of\nthe Gothic, with its supernatural setting, the \"fatality\" of its hero,\nthe horror of its _d\u00e9nouement_, the wild fantasy of its witches'\nchamber, and its amorous wealth of descriptive detail in which old\nfabrics, old furniture, swords, daggers, and hangings abound. Victor\nHugo, above all, was the chosen bard of the Gothic and the romanesque. Besides his dramas, his \"Odes et Ballades\" were in the mouth of every\nchild who could pay four halfpence for an hour's luxury in the _cabinet\nde lecture_; and schoolboys would declaim for hours in antiphon such\npassages as the invocation of \"La Bande Noire\":\n\n    _O murs! \u00f4 cr\u00e9neaux! \u00f4 tourelles!_\n    _Remparts! foss\u00e9s aux ponts mouvants!_\n    _Lourds faisceaux de colonnes fr\u00eales!_\n    _Fiers ch\u00e2teaux!",

      "passage": "A word uttered\nthere was round the town in two hours; there a poet was made or a play\ndamned--in the twinkling of an eye. One day of its activity furnished\nall the wit of the next day's newspapers, which is hardly surprising\nwhen so many of its members were journalists. _Le tout Paris_ was not\nhide-bound in its requirements; it admitted high birth as one\nqualification for membership, wealth if accompanied by good manners as\nanother, but a certain way to its heart was by a brilliant handling of\nthe pen. In spite of the exaggeration of the Parisian scenes in\n\"Illusions Perdues,\" there is no unreality in Balzac's picture of\nLucien's sudden rise from impoverished obscurity to fame and money. Lucien, the provincial poet, after his disappointing elopement with\nMadame de Bargeton, retires discomfited to a garret in the Quartier\nLatin. The door of rich protectors is shut in his face, no publisher\nwill read his poems or accept his novels. The serpent arrives in the\nshape of Lousteau, who shows him the devilish power of journalism. By a\nlucky chance Lucien is asked to write a dramatic criticism for a new\npaper. He succeeds brilliantly, and he has Paris at his feet. The\npublisher cringes before his power and publishes all that he had\nformerly rejected; with money, fine clothes, and a reputation, he can\nanswer stare for stare and return the impertinences of Rastignac and de\nMarsay; even Madame de Bargeton in the Faubourg St.-Germain cowers from\nhis revengeful epigrams. So long as he remains a power in the Press he\nis flattered and caressed and plumes himself, a butterfly only just\nemerged, in the glittering _tout Paris_ of his day. The moral of Lucien de Rubempr\u00e9, so far as we are immediately concerned,\nis not ethical, but resolves itself into the truth that there was an\nopen passage between Bohemia and _le tout Paris_ which was crossed by\nnot a few. Gautier crossed it, so did Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye, Ourliac, the\ndramatist, and several others. There were also men who seemed to spend\ntheir time between the two, like the elder Dumas, Roger de Beauvoir, and\nAlfred de Musset, who combined the extravagance of Bohemia with the\nluxury of the boulevards in different proportions, without ever being\nentire Bohemians or complete _viveurs_, and who maintained such a\ncontinuous communication between the more literary sections of _le tout\nParis_ and the finer talents of Bohemia that it would be in some cases\ndifficult to say where one left off and the other began. It is therefore\nimpossible to write of the _vie de Boh\u00e8me_ without entering into this\nlarger and more conspicuous life of what may be called _la haute\nBoh\u00e8me_. Not only was it the sound-board from which in a lucky moment\nthe struggling whisperer on the left bank might hear his utterances\nbooming forth to a multitude eager for novelty, not only was it an\nunofficial academy to which every Bohemian might aspire to belong as\nsoon as he had made his mark, but it was also, during the years\nfollowing 1830, animated by such a spirit of revelry and reckless\namusement that the riots of true Bohemia were as pale ghosts before its\nmore notable orgies.",

Thought seemed to vanish during lunch, but when he had retired to his\nroom again, it returned for another half hour. At the end of that time\nhe apparently came to a decision, and jumping up briskly, repaired to\nthe manageress' room.

The passenger in the last third class compartment but one, looking\nout of the window sombrely and intently, saw nothing now but desolate\nbrown hills and a winding lonely river, very northern looking under\nthe autumnal sky. He was alone in the carriage, and if any one had happened to study his\nmovements during the interminable journey, they would have concluded\nthat for some reason he seemed to have a singularly strong inclination\nfor solitude. In fact this was at least the third compartment he had\noccupied, for whenever a fellow traveller entered, he unostentatiously\ndescended, and in a moment had slipped, also unostentatiously, into an\nempty carriage. Finally he had selected one at the extreme end of the\ntrain, a judicious choice which had ensured privacy for the last couple\nof hours. When the train at length paused in the midst of the moorlands and for\nsome obscure reason this spot was selected for the examination of\ntickets, another feature of this traveller's character became apparent. He had no ticket, he confessed, but named the last station as his place\nof departure and the next as his destination. Being an entirely\nrespectable looking person, his statement was accepted and he slipped\nthe change for half a crown into his pocket; just as he had done a\nnumber of times previously in the course of his journey. Evidently the\npassenger was of an economical as well as of a secretive disposition. As the light began to fade and the grey sky to change into a deeper\ngrey, and the lighted train to glitter through the darkening moors, and\nhe could see by his watch that their distant goal was now within an\nhour's journey, the man showed for the first time signs of a livelier\ninterest. He peered out keenly into the dusk as though recognising old\nlandmarks, and now and then he shifted in his seat restlessly and a\nlittle nervously. He was a man of middle age or upwards, of middle height, and thickset. Round his neck he wore a muffler, so drawn up as partially to conceal\nthe lower part of his face, and a black felt hat was drawn down over\nhis eyes. Between them could be seen only the gleam of his eyes, the\ntip of his nose, and the stiff hairs of a grizzled moustache. Out of his overcoat pocket he pulled a pipe and for a moment looked at\nit doubtfully, and then, as if the temptation were irresistible, he\ntook out a tobacco pouch too. It was almost flat and he jealously\npicked up a shred that fell on the floor, and checked himself at last\nwhen the bowl was half filled. And then for a while he smoked very\nslowly, savouring each whiff. When they stopped at the last station or two, the reserved and exclusive\ndisposition of this traveller became still more apparent. Not only was\nhe so muffled up as to make recognition by an unwelcome acquaintance\nexceedingly difficult, but so long as they paused at the stations he sat\nwith his face resting on his hand, and when they moved on again, an air\nof some relief was apparent. But a still more remarkable instance of this sensitive passion for\nprivacy appeared when the train stopped at the ticket platform just\noutside its final destination.",

Alphonso's attempts to recover possession\n(fourth siege) were futile, though pertinacious and heroic, and he was\nobliged to content himself with a tribute for the rock from Abdul\nMelek of Granada; but after his successful attack on Algeciras in 1344\nhe was encouraged to try his fortune again at Gibraltar. In 1349 he\ninvested the rock, but the siege (fifth siege) was brought to an\nuntimely close by his death from the plague in February, 1350. The\nnext or sixth siege resulted simply in the transference of the coveted\nposition from the hands of the King of Morocco to those of Yussef III. of Granada; and the seventh, undertaken by the Spanish Count of\nNiebla, Enrico de Guzman, proved fatal to the besieger and his forces. In 1462, however, success attended the efforts of Alphonso de Arcos\n(eighth siege), and in August the rock passed once more under\nChristian sway. The Duke of Medina Sidonia, a powerful grandee who had\nassisted in its capture, was anxious to get possession of the\nfortress, and though Henry IV. at first managed to maintain the claims\nof the crown, the duke ultimately made good his ambition by force of\narms (ninth siege), and in 1469 the king was constrained to declare\nhis son and his heirs perpetual governors of Gibraltar. In 1479\nFerdinand and Isabella made the second duke Marquis of Gibraltar, and\nin 1492 the third duke, Don Juan, was reluctantly allowed to retain\nthe fortress. At length, in 1501, Garcilaso de la Vega was ordered to\ntake possession of the place in the king's name, and it was formally\nincorporated with the domains of the crown. After Ferdinand and\nIsabella were both dead the duke, Don Juan, tried in 1506 to recover\npossession, and added a tenth to the list of sieges. Thirty-four years\nafterward the garrison had to defend itself against a much more\nformidable attack (eleventh siege)--the pirates of Algiers having\ndetermined to recover the rock for Mahomet and themselves. The\nconflict was severe, but resulted in the repulse of the besiegers. After this the Spaniards made great efforts to strengthen the place,\nand they succeeded so well that throughout Europe Gibraltar was\nregarded as impregnable. In the course of the war of the Spanish succession, however, it was\ntaken by a combined English and Dutch fleet under Sir George Rooke,\nassisted by a body of troops under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt. The captors had ostensibly fought in the interests of Charles Archduke\nof Austria (afterward Charles III. ), but, though his sovereignty over\nthe rock was proclaimed on July 24, 1704, Sir George Rooke on his own\nresponsibility caused the English flag to be hoisted, and took\npossession in name of Queen Anne. It is hardly to the honor of England\nthat it was both unprincipled enough to sanction and ratify the\noccupation and ungrateful enough to leave unrewarded the general to\nwhose unscrupulous patriotism the acquisition was due. The Spaniards\nkeenly felt the injustice done to them, and the inhabitants of the\ntown of Gibraltar in great numbers abandoned their homes rather than\nrecognize the authority of the invaders.",

      "passage": "This, however, is not sufficient to establish the pyrogenic origin of\nall crystallized paraffine, as crystals can be obtained from the\namorphous residues by distillation at normal or reduced pressure or in\na current of steam. To explain these facts two assumptions are\npossible. Either the chemical and physical properties of all or some\nof the solid constituents are changed by the distillation, and the\nparaffine is changed from the amorphous into the crystalline variety,\nor the change produced by the distillation takes place in the medium\n(i.e., the mother liquid) in which the paraffine exists. The change\neffected in ozokerite and in petroleum residues when crystalline\nparaffine is obtained by distillation is to be regarded as a\npurification, and can be effected partially by treatment with amyl\nalcohol. In the same way, by repeated treatment of petroleum residuum\nwith amyl alcohol, a substance of melting point 59\u00b0 C. can be\nobtained, which cannot be distinguished from ordinary paraffine. The treatment with amyl alcohol has therefore accomplished the same\nresults as was obtained by distillation, and the action is probably\nthe same, i.e., a partial separation of colloid substance. These\nfacts point to the conclusion that crystallizable paraffine exists\nready formed in both petroleum and in ozokerite, but in both cases\nother colloidal substances prevent its crystallization. By\ndistillation, these colloids appear to be destroyed or changed so as\nto allow the paraffine to crystallize. It is a generally known fact that liquids always appear among the\nproducts of the distillation of paraffine, no matter in what way the\ndistillation be conducted. This shows that some paraffine is\ndecomposed in the operation. The name _proto-paraffine_ has been given to ozokerite and to the\nparaffine of petroleum in contradistinction to _pyro-paraffine_, the\nname that has been applied to the paraffine obtained by distillation\nfrom any source. According to Reichenbach, paraffine may crystallize in three forms:\nneedles, angular grains, and leaflets having the luster of\nmother-of-pearl. Hofstadter, in an article on the identity of\nparaffine from different sources, confirmed this statement, and added\nfurther that at first needles, then the angular forms, and then the\nleaflets are formed. Fritsche found, by means of the microscope, in\nthe ethereal solution of ozokerite, very fine and thin crystal\nleaflets concentrically grouped, and in the alcoholic solution fine\nirregular leaflets. Zaloziecki has recently developed these\nmicroscopic investigations to a much greater extent. According to this\nobserver, the principal part of paraffine, as seen under the\nmicroscope, consists of shining stratified leaflets with a darker\nedge. The most characteristic and well developed crystals are formed\nby dissolving paraffine in a mixture of ethyl and amyl alcohols and\nchilling. The crystals are rhombic or hexagonal tablets or leaves, and\nare quite regularly formed. They are unequally developed in different\nvarieties of paraffine. The best developed are those obtained from\nceresine. Their relative size and appearance give an indication as to\nthe purity of the paraffine, and, as they are always present, they are\nto be counted among the characteristic tests for paraffine. Reichenbach observed that mere traces of empyreumatic oil prevented\ntheir formation.",

Murrayana_ and _P. tuberculata_ are replacing the more valuable species by the same\nprocess. In this case, also, the worthless trees are the shortest lived. So we\nsee that nature is doing all that she can to remedy the evil. Man only\nis reckless, and especially the American man. The Mexican will cut\nlarge limbs off his trees for fuel, but will spare the tree. Even the\npoor Indian, when at the starvation point, stripping the bark from the\nyellow pine (_P. ponderosa_), for the mucilaginous matter being formed\ninto sap wood, will never take a strip wider than one third the\ncircumference of the tree, so that its growth may not be injured. We often read that oaks are springing up in destroyed forests where\noaks had never grown before. The writers are no doubt sincere, but\nthey are careless. The only pine forests where oaks are not intermixed\nare either in land so sandy that oaks cannot be made to grow on them\nat all, or so far north that they are beyond their northern limit. In\nthe Green Mountains and in the New England forests, in the pine\nforests in Pennsylvania, in the Adirondacks, in Wisconsin and\nMichigan--except in sand--I have found oaks mixed with the pines and\nspruces. In northwestern Minnesota and in northern Dakota the oaks are\nnear their northern limit, but even there the burr oak drags on a bare\nexistence among the pines and spruces. In the Black Hills, in Dakota,\npoor, forlorn, scrubby burr oaks are scattered through the hills among\nthe yellow pines. In Colorado we find them as shrubs among the pines\nand Douglas spruces. In New Mexico we find them scattered among the\npi\u00f1ons. In Arizona they grow like hazel bushes among the yellow pines. On the Sierra Nevada the oak region crosses the pine region, and\nscattering oaks reach far up into the mountains. Yet oaks will not\nflourish between the one hundredth meridian and the eastern base of\nthe Sierras, owing to the aridity of the climate. I recently found\noaks scattered among the redwoods on both sides of the Coast Range\nMountains. Darwin has truly said, \"The oaks are driving the pines to the sands.\" Wherever the oak is established--and we have seen that it is already\nestablished whereever it can endure the soil and climate--there it\nwill remain and keep on advancing. The oak produces comparatively few\nseeds. Where it produces a hundred, the ash and maple will yield a\nthousand, the elm ten thousand, and many other trees a hundred\nthousand. The acorn has no provision for protection and transportation\nlike many tree seeds. Many kinds are furnished with wings to float\nthem on the water and carry them in the air. Nearly every tree seed,\nexcept the acorn, has a case to protect it while growing, either\nopening and casting the seeds off to a distance when ripe or falling\nwith them to protect them till they begin to germinate. Even the\nequally large seeds of other kinds are protected in some way. The\nhickory nut has a hard shell, which shell itself is protected by a\nstrong covering until ripe. The black walnut has both a hard shell and\na fleshy covering.",

Strether in due course accompanied his friend to the room he had bespoken and had, before going out, scrupulously visited; where at the end of another half-hour he had no less discreetly left him. On leaving him he repaired straight to his own room, but with the prompt effect of feeling the compass of that chamber resented by his condition. There he enjoyed at once the first consequence of their reunion. A place was too small for him after it that had seemed large enough before. He had awaited it with something he would have been sorry, have been almost ashamed not to recognise as emotion, yet with a tacit assumption at the same time that emotion would in the event find itself relieved. The actual oddity was that he was only more excited; and his excitement\u2014to which indeed he would have found it difficult instantly to give a name\u2014brought him once more downstairs and caused him for some minutes vaguely to wander. He went once more to the garden; he looked into the public room, found Miss Gostrey writing letters and backed out; he roamed, fidgeted and wasted time; but he was to have his more intimate session with his friend before the evening closed.",

But all these new landscapes were not brought forth simultaneously; some of the highest, where the ice lingered longest, are tens of centuries younger than those of the warmer regions below them. In general, the younger the mountain-landscapes,--younger, I mean, with reference to the time of their emergence from the ice of the glacial period,--the less separable are they into artistic bits capable of being made into warm, sympathetic, lovable pictures with appreciable humanity in them. Here, however, on the head waters of the Tuolumne, is a group of wild peaks on which the geologist may say that the sun has but just begun to shine, which is yet in a high degree picturesque, and in its main features so regular and evenly balanced as almost to appear conventional--one somber cluster of snow-laden peaks with gray pinefringed granite bosses braided around its base, the whole surging free into the sky from the head of a magnificent valley, whose lofty walls are beveled away on both sides so as to embrace it all without admitting anything not strictly belonging to it. The foreground was now aflame with autumn colors, brown and purple and gold, ripe in the mellow sunshine; contrasting brightly with the deep, cobalt blue of the sky, and the black and gray, and pure, spiritual white of the rocks and glaciers. Down through the midst, the young Tuolumne was seen pouring from its crystal fountains, now resting in glassy pools as if changing back again into ice, now leaping in white cascades as if turning to snow; gliding right and left between granite bosses, then sweeping on through the smooth, meadowy levels of the valley, swaying pensively from side to side with calm, stately gestures past dipping willows and sedges, and around groves of arrowy pine; and throughout its whole eventful course, whether flowing fast or slow, singing loud or low, ever filling the landscape with spiritual animation, and manifesting the grandeur of its sources in every movement and tone.",
