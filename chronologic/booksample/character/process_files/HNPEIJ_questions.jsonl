I didn't want Fay to say anything to offend Annabel. \"Of course you don't, darling, and I am only too delighted to be clung to to any extent; it is most warming and comforting to me. But I fear Annabel is right in regarding me as the old oak tree to which the ivy clings.' 99 Fay slipped her hand into mine, under cover of the breakfast-table. \"You aren't a bit old, Reggie!\" she said indignantly. \"Is he, Frank?\" \"I've known older,\" replied Frank guardedly. At this we all laughed especially Annabel. Frank's jokes usually appealed to her, though Fay's didn't, which was strange, as the twins resembled each other mentally almost as much as they did physically: it was only in the deeper places of the spirit that the resemblance ended. \"Reggie is not old and he is not young,\" said Annabel; \"I never can understand why people make such a fuss about their ages. I am forty-eight and Reggie is forty-three this year, and I make no bones about it, ​1 1\nIN JUNE 175 and it would be no good if I did, as it's in Burke and Debrett for all the world to read. And I really don't think, my dear Fay, that 'a twopenny dam' is at all a nice expression for a young lady to use: I cannot bear to hear women swear.\" \"It isn't swearing, Miss Kingsnorth,\" cried Frank, who was always ready to stick up for his sister; \"it's a foreign coin which was much used by the great Duke of Wellington.\" \"So I've heard,\" replied Annabel, with doubt in her tone. \"But all I can say is that if it isn't swearing, it sounds uncommonly like it, and I'm sure that any ordinary person hearing it would do Fay an injustice, and imagine that she was given to bad language.' I felt it was time to read the Riot Act and disperse the company; so I rose from the table and took my pipe out of my pocket, saying: \"Come on, little girl, and watch me smoking in the garden. It will be a soothing, soporific sight.\" Fay jumped up and followed me, as I knew she would. One of her most fascinating tricks was a habit she had of trotting about the house and garden after me like a little child. And yet in some things she was so much of a woman! \"I say, sweetheart,\" I said as soon as we were out of earshot of the house, \"I wouldn't use strong language before Annabel, if I were you. She doesn't understand it, and it gives her false ideas of you.\" Fay's scarlet lips pouted. \"It wasn't strong language. Frank told you it wasn't.\" It always annoyed me when Fay quoted Frank, and especially when she did so in order to confute me. \"I know, my darling; but Annabel thought it was.\" \"I can't help Annabel's thoughts. She thought you were old!\" I laughed, and patted the soft, white cheek so near to my own as we sat down side by side on a gardenseat. \"No, she didn't, little one.\" \"Well, anyway she said so.\" \"No, she didn't. She said I was forty-threewhich I am, and forty-three seems quite young to \n\nAnnabel, though old to you.\" Fay still looked angry. \"Indeed it doesn't. It seems quite young to me. And whatever it seems, I don't see the good of harping on it and rubbing it in, as Annabel is always doing. If she says 'forty-three' again, I shall say 'twopenny dam.'\" I laughed outright. Fay was so delicious when she was annoyed, like a brilliant little bird with ruffled plumage. Then I said softly, as I put my arms round her slender waist: \"No you won't, sweetheart, you'll never say it again, if it vexes Annabel. I want you and Annabel to love each other more than I want anything in the world.\" \"More than you want you and me to love each other?\""}

It is all in His hands. But I am inclined to think that as there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, so the gift of healing is given to one, the gift of preaching to another, and so on, and we have not all the same gifts. It is all Christ working in us; but He works one way in one person and another way in another. We must cultivate the gift that we have, and be content to do without the gifts that have been denied us, and as we are all members of Christ there can be no rivalry amongst us.\" \"After all,\" I said after a moment's silence, \"we are sent into the world to do the Will and not to trouble about the Doctrine: that follows the other\nas a matter of course. And submission is the most necessary and the most difficult lesson we have to learn. If we were allowed to choose our gifts I should have chosen the one of healing; but we are not allowed to choose.\" Mr. Henderson looked at me intently for a moment with his piercing dark eyes. \"I do not know, but I think that you have the gift of healing,\" he said; \"utterly uncultivated and undeveloped, but ready for \n\nChrist's use, should He need it.\" And then the motor came round, and he drove away to the multitudinous duties awaiting him in town, and I went upstairs to rejoice with Fay, as before I had mourned with her.

As far as I can judge, the only reason for being given garments at all is the fact that one doesn't deserve them.

As I've told you, the rule of the Guild is that for every twenty garments given by a particular parish, a grant of twenty garments is allotted to that parish; while the odd garments outside the twenties are given to the poorest East-end parishes, who can't afford to send any garments at all.\" \"I know, I know!\" I cried hastily, in a valiant attempt to stem the flood of Annabel's explanations. But she went on as if I had not spoken. \"Therefore, you see, when a well-to-do parish sends less than twenty garments, it doesn't get any grant at all; and that is just what I am saying about Summerglade. Summerglade didn't send as many as twenty garments, did it, Fay?\" \"No, Miss Kingsnorth, only a measly seventeen. \"I blame the Vicar, Mr. Sneyd, for that,\" said \n\nAnnabel severely. \"He is a most feeble person, and takes no interest at all in the Needlework Guild. He called here for a subscription for Foreign Missions the other day, which I considered a great impertinence, as I cannot see what claim the foreign heathen of \n\nSummerglade have upon me. I thought him a most. stupid man.\" \"I thought him a blooming idiot,\" exclaimed Fay.

Both the Wildacres had always been slight and slender, but it was the slightness and slenderness of perfect health: now Frank's thinness amounted to positive emaciation, and his face was pinched and peaked. Moreover, he had lost that appearance of essential and eternal youth which had been so marked a characteristic of him and of Fay, and without which he hardly seemed a Wildacre at all. But in one thing he was unchanged, and that was in his perfect ease of manner and absolute unself-consciousness. Although I could see that it required all his self-control to enable him to respond naturally to my greeting, as indeed it required all my self-control to give it, nevertheless he succeeded: and I could not help admiring the pluck and courage of the boy when \n\nI remembered how much lay between his departure from the Manor and his return to it. As I recalled what bright and beautiful beings Wildacre and his children had been at one time, and realised that this broken wreck of a boy was all that was left of the once brilliant trio, a wave of misery at the pity of it all swept over my soul. I thought of \n\nWildacre as he used to be in the old boyish days, and then of Frank and Fay when they first came to the \n\nRecto after their father's death: and I felt that I was face to face with the hopeless tragedy of what might have been but was not, because the folly and sin of man frustrated the Wisdom and Righteousness of God, as for some hidden reason it has been per-\nmitted to do ever since the forbidden tree was planted in the midst of the garden. And that is how the last of the Wildacres came to Restham. For some days I saw but little of Frank. Ponty took him into her tender keeping and set about nursing him back to health, only allowing him to come downstairs and lie on the Chesterfield couch by the hall fire for a few hours every day. It was astonishing to me to find Ponty so good to Frank. She had always resented his presence at Restham even before he had worked any mischief there: yet now she took him into her charge, and nursed him as devotedly as if she had been his mother. I remarked upon this change of front one day. \"I am surprised you are so kind to Mr. Wildacre, Ponty, considering how angry you were when first I asked him to come and live at the Manor. I was afraid you wouldn't like his coming back in this way.\" \"Well, you see, Master Reggie, when I was that set against his coming to the Manor, he was strong and well, and so could stand up to me, as you might say: but now he is too weak and ill to hurt a fly. There's lots of folks as you can't stand at any price when they are able to stick up for themselves: but when they are knocked down you'd do anything you could to help them to get up again.' 99 \"Women are made like that-thank God!\" I said. \"I remember there was a girl at Poppenhall who'd had a fine upstanding young man after her for years and years, and she couldn't so much as look at him, though all the other girls envied her for having such a handsome beau: but he lost an arm and got his face scarred in an accident down a coal-pit, and then she married him at once, and spent the rest of her life\nin looking after him and trying to take the place of his lost arm.' 99 \"A woman all over!\" I remarked."}

I dressed hurriedly, and without waiting for any breakfast went straight to the Rectory to remind \n\nBlathwayte of what Henderson had said. It was too early as yet for the doctor's visit, and the night-nurse was still upon duty; but she had nothing good to report, as Fay's temperature kept up and her strength was failing. \"Come and see,\" said Blathwayte, when I had recalled Henderson's words to his mind. \"If he was right, and you have the gift, you may save Fay's life even yet.\" And he took me into the sick-room, where the shadow of my darling lay fighting for breath. Then followed another of those experiences which sound incredible in the telling, but which was so natural-so inevitable-at the time, that it would have been impossible for anything else to have happened. I knelt down by Fay's bed and laid my hand on her burning forehead, and I lifted up my soul to God in prayer, as I had never lifted it before. As I prayed\n\nI became conscious-as I had been when Frank seemed dying of a Presence in the room, the Presence of a living Christ who was standing by my side so near that I could almost feel His Touch-so real that I felt if I opened my eyes I should see His Face. And with His coming all the sorrow and anxiety and misery disappeared, and I knew that nothing could ever really harm her or pluck her out of His Hand. Fear vanished, because with Him beside me there was nothing to fear: sorrow disappeared, because He brought with Him fulness of joy: death stood at bay, because He had conquered death. There was nothing\nIIO  \n\nany longer except Him, because in Him and through Him and of Him are all things. And I was conscious not only of a profound peace in this Ineffable Presence: \n\nI was conscious also of an inexhaustible power. I felt flowing into me, and through me into Fay, a sort of wonderful electric current-a very elixir of life itself-which I can describe as nothing but \"the Power from on High.\" At that moment I felt that I had the wings of eagles, and the strength of the angels that excel. How long I knelt I know not. It was a moment snatched from eternity, and therefore beyond the measurements of time. I realised that in His glorious \n\nPresence there is neither past nor future, but only one glorious, unending Now. Gradually the Presence withdrew Itself, and the rush of Power flowing through me subsided, and I opened my eyes and looked at Fay. The fever flush in her cheeks was already fading, and the brow under my hand grew cool and moist. I rose from my knees and told the nurse to take the temperature: she did so, and found it rapidly subsiding. The pulse, too, was slower, and the breathing much easier. By the time that the doctor came he was able to say that the crisis was past, and that the patient was on the way to recovery. Of course, both the doctor and the nurses were amazed beyond words: they could not account for such a sudden and unexpected turn for the better. But I was not surprised. I had been too recently in the Presence of Christ to wonder at any manifestation of His Power."}

I should have thought an accumulation of soot in the throat was a most unwholesome thing, apart from the danger of fire.\" \"It was a judgment upon him, that's all I can say, and it isn't for us to dictate whether Providence shall punish evildoers by choking or by burning.\" \"Certainly not,\" I replied. \"I am the last person to take it upon myself to dictate to Providence.' \"But smoking or no smoking, it's a fair treat to see you and Miss Annabel at home again,\" said Ponty with most gracious smile; \"for when all's said and done the house don't seem like the house without you. For my part, I don't hold with so much gadding about; \n\nI never did; but you and Miss Annabel was always set\nRESTHAM MANOR \n\n4I on having your own way, and I doubt always will be.\" \"Set on having Annabel's way, you mean,' I \n\namended. \"Just so, Master Reggie; from the time you were a little boy Miss Annabel always made up your mind for you, and I doubt if she'll ever get out of the habit now. But it's a pity! For though I'm the last to say a word against Miss Annabel, me having nursed. her ever since she was a month old, and the most beautiful baby you ever saw, with a complexion like wax, still she's a bit too wilful, and you and your poor papa always having given way to her has made her worse. It doesn't do to be too self-willed.\" \"But I'm not,\" I pleaded. \"No; more's the pity! It would be a sight better for Miss Annabel if you were. I don't hold with folks always getting their own way, especially women. I remember a well-to-do woman at Poppenhall when I was a girl who was that set on marrying a particular man as never was, and nothing else would do to content her. And they lived on at her house after they were married, her being a woman of means. He caught the fever from drinking the water out of her well, the well not having been cleaned out for years and most unhealthy, and died just a month after their wedding-day, which I hold was a judgment on her for being so set on marrying that particular man.\" \"But any other man might have got the fever from the insanitary well,\" I suggested. \"But no other man ever did. Which is a lesson to us all not to be too set on having our own way, nor to let other people be too set either. I doubt that trouble will come some day from your being so under the thumb of Miss Annabel; I do indeed; and\nI'm sure I'm sorry in my heart for Cutler when the things in the garden don't come exactly as she meant them to.\" \"I'm sorry for him, too,\" I added. And I really was."}

At least that is what is generally believed; but I cannot say whether it is more than a tradition, like the idea that the sun will put a fire out.\" \"But is that only a tradition?\" Annabel asked. “I always pull the blinds down when the sunshine falls on the fire, for fear of putting it out.\" \"For fear of putting which out,\" I inquired, \"the sunshine or the fire?\" \"The fire, of course. How could anything put the sunshine out, Reggie? How silly you are!\" \"It is pure superstition,\" answered Blathwayte, who found it as blessed to give information as did my sister to receive it; \"a fire naturally by force of contrast looks less brilliant in the sunlight than in the shade, but the sunlight has no actual effect on it whatsoever.\" At this juncture I happened to catch Frank's eye, and to my delight perceived that the humour of the situation struck him as it struck me. Of course I knew how funny it was of Annabel and Arthur to take hold of all the romance of life, and transmute it-\nFRANK by some strange alchemy of their own-into useful and intelligent information; I had seen them at it for years and years, and had never failed to enjoy the sight; but it was very clever of Frank, who had known \n\nArthur for two months and Annabel for twenty minutes, to see that it was funny also. \"My last question was not so silly after all,\" I remarked. \"I think the sunshine of life is frequently extinguished by a too great absorption in the cares of the domestic hearth. See, for instance, those numerous cases where the energy of the spring-fever expends itself upon the exigencies of the spring-cleaning.” \"I hate a spring-cleaning,\" exclaimed Frank: \"it always means that everything is put back into something else's place, and you can never find anything you want till you've left off wanting it.\" \"But you find all the things you wanted the spring before last,\" I added, \"and have now forgotten that you ever possessed, and have no longer any use for.\" \"And all your books seem to have played General \n\nPost,\" continued Frank; \"Volume One has changed places with Volume Six, and the dictionary is where the Bible ought to be, and the cookery book is among the poems. \"I never keep a Bible in a bookcase,\" remarked \n\nAnnabel; \"it somehow doesn't seem reverent to do so.\" I could not let this pass.. \"Yes, you do: you keep one in that bookcase in your bedroom. I've seen it there.\" \"Oh! a bookcase in a bedroom is quite a different thing from an ordinary library bookcase, Reggie; in fact I never keep any but religious books in my bedroom bookcase. One doesn't, somehow.\" \"I cannot see,\" I argued, \"why a hanging book-\ncase in a bedroom-forming, mark you, a companion ornament to the medicine-chest on the other side of the wardrobe-is a more reverent resting-place for a Bible than is the shelf of a well-stocked library. Why should clothes and drugs exhale a more holy atmosphere than secular literature?\" But no arguments ever shook Annabel. \"I can't explain why it's different, but it is different, Reggie; and if you don't see it, you ought to. And I'm sure the sun does put it out, Arthur, because I've seen it do it.\" Whereupon Arthur proceeded to expound at some length the reason why it was scientifically impossible for sunlight to put out firelight; whilst Frank and I took the opportunity of stepping out-of-doors into the garden. \"I see what you mean about things being so much more than they actually are, Sir Reginald,\" began the boy as soon as we were out of earshot of the effects -or rather the non-effects-of sun upon fire; \"it never struck me quite like that before, but it makes everything most awfully interesting when you look at it in that way.' 99 \"I know it does. And it is not only the most interesting way-it is also the truest way-of looking at things."}

And it was on the day of our return home from one of these East-wind-eluding excursions, when Arthur and I were smoking after dinner in the Manor dining-room, that he asked the curtain-raising question: \"Reggie, do you remember Wildacre?\" Of course I remembered him; who that had ever known Wildacre could help remembering him? And the memory conjured up a vision of one of the most attractive personalities I had ever met. Wildacre had been a friend of Blathwayte's and mine at Oxford; but after we left college the friendship had gradually fizzled out, owing to the extreme (not to say dull) respectability of Arthur and myself, and the exact opposite on the part of Wildacre. But what charm he had-what superabundant vitality-what artistic genius! All of which came back to me with a rush as I answered Arthur's question. \"Remember Wildacre? Rather! But why? Have you heard anything about him?\" \"Yes,\" replied Blathwayte in his turn. \"I've heard\na good deal while you've been abroad. In fact, I've seen him.\" \"Seen him! Lucky old Arthur! I should like to see him too. It would almost make one young again to see Wildacre.\" \"Well, it didn't exactly have that effect, as he was dying, you see.\" Wildacre dying! The idea seemed impossible. Wildacre had always been so full of life that one couldn't imagine him and Death hobnobbing; they could have nothing in common with each other! And as to that Other Life beyond the grave-in which in my own way I believed quite as firmly as did Arthur-one couldn't imagine Wildacre at home there either. \"Wildacre mustn't die yet!\" I exclaimed; \"not till he's done something with all that genius of his and that overflowing energy! I couldn't bear to think of his dying until he's made a name for himself. Wildacre is a real poet, and he'll be a great poet some day.\" Blathwayte shook his head. \"He once might have been; he had it in him, but he lost his opportunity, and lost opportunities don't return.\" \"No, Arthur, you are right there. There is no bringing the shadow on the dial ten degrees backward. What is past is past, and what is written is written, and Fate sends us no revise proofs to correct. The youth we wasted or frittered or abused or ignored never comes back to us to be lived over again, though we may shout ourselves hoarse with crying for it.\" And for the moment the backwater feeling rushed over me with such force that I felt almost suffocated with the hopeless pain of it. \"That is the real tragedy of life,\" I went on, \"that there are no encores.\" \"Poor Wildacre had it in him to do great things,' said Arthur, \"but he lost his chance. At least he did worse than lose it; he threw it away to the swine, and trampled it among the husks.\" \"But he may do something even yet,\" I argued. \"Genius-and Wildacre had genius-never grows old. And, hang it all, man, he isn't so old after all! He is only two or three years older than we are, and we aren't really old-only buried alive, which is quite a different thing. If we lived in London instead of in the blessed, peaceful country, we should still be considered young men about town. Mind you, I'm not grumbling: I should hate to be a young man about town, and I enjoy being buried alive; but I kick at being called old at forty-two. It's positively libellous !\" 99 \"It isn't because Wildacre is old that he won't do anything now,\" replied Arthur simply; \"but because he is dead.\" The words came to me with a shock."}
