ChronoLogic benchmark
=====================

Work on a benchmark that will measure a model's ability to reason, as reasoning is understood in a particular historical context.

Right now, the only code here is in the subfolder training_strategies, and is being used to explore ways of generating "candidate passages" we could use as the foundation for a benchmark.
