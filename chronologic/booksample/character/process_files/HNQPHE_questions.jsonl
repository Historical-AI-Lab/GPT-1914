Then, without a word, she led the way to a room at the left of the entrance hall. The place was softly lighted, but the heavy shades at the windows prevented this fact from being apparent from the street. \"How are you?\" Miss Liebmann exclaimed, seating herself in an easy chair. \"I've been expecting you for the past two days.

If all goes well, I shall be at Ostend by morning, and see Herr Schwartz before noon.\" \"I should think the wireless would be quicker,\" Hoffman remarked. \"It would be, but I do not dare to attempt to reach our people. The police know me. The risk is too great. My instructions from \n\nHerr Schwartz are to bring the news to him in person. If it is as important as I expect, we cannot afford to take any chances.

It is my hope that we may be able to see each other-often-when this is over.\" Hoffman realized for the second time that the girl was showing more than a professional interest in him. He felt embarrassed, a bit afraid. Was this, also, a test? \"I hope so, too,\" he said, pretending a satisfaction he did not feel. \"We shall be good friends, shall we not?\" \"Friends!\" Miss Liebmann put out her hand, and Hoffman took it. \"More than friends, I trust, Mr. Hoffman,\" she whispered, pressing his fingers in hers. \"But we are losing time.\" She glanced at the watch on her wrist. \"What message am I to take to Herr Schwartz?\" THE WEB \n\nHoffman made no reply. Instead, he drew from his pocket the despatch he had taken from \n\nLord Brooke's desk. \"Take him this,\" he said, handing it to his companion.

The Governor turned to him, indicating Hoffman with a gesture. \"This person is Robert Hoffman, who claims to be an American war correspondent.

THE WEB \n\n39 The officer motioned sternly toward the door, and Hoffman went out into the corridor. His heart beat rather more rapidly than usual. The 22nd was just six days off. CHAPTER V THE \n\nHE six days that Bob Hoffman spent in prison in Antwerp were, to a man of his temperament, almost unbearable. He was well enough treated. The room in which he was confined was fairly commodious, and reasonably well furnished, with no suggestion of the dungeon cell about it. There was an unbarred window from which he might have attempted to escape, but for the fact that it was, in the first place, forty feet from the ground, that in the second, it opened on a courtyard in which paced an armed guard, and in the third, that he had no reason whatever for attempting to escape in any event. Meals, not elaborate, but well cooked, were brought in by an orderly, who glared at him without speaking. No newspapers were allowed him. His belongings, of every sort, down to his fountain pen, his finger ring, his scarf pin, even, had been taken from him. He could not have communicated with anyone outside, had he so desired, which, as matters stood, he did not. A few books in German, product of that period 40\nTHE WEB \n\n41 in Teutonic literature in which materialism had not crowded out the idealism of the race, provided the only means by which he might while away the tedious hours. For the better part of six nights and days he alternately read \"The \n\nSorrows of Werther,\" and thought of Patricia. As the days passed, he grew tired of Werther's sorrows, and spent more time over his own."}

Hoffman went up to the rooms, which he found to be a comfortable sitting-room, with bed-chamber adjoining. They were on the third floor, in the rear of the house, and the bow window of the sitting-room overlooked a garden, with the rear windows of a number of houses opposite, just as Herr Schwartz had said. Having his luggage brought up, Hoffman made a hasty toilet, and, after securing a light supper, drove to Lord Brooke's. He had been away from London eight days. It seemed to him as many months. He wondered what Patricia would have to say to him. CHAPTER VII THE \n\nHE Honorable Patricia Burke was a young woman of very decided likes and dislikes. Also, she had a kind heart. Consequently, when, one cold night, a woman called to see her who described herself as a refugee from France, she affected not to notice the upturned nose of Patrick, the butler, who referred to the caller as \"a foreign-looking person,\" and went down to interview the woman herself. Crouched on a leather-covered seat in the hall was a slight, good-looking young girl, with large, eager eyes, and heavy black hair. Her clothing was scanty and poor, her shoes worn, her whole appearance that of one who has suffered much hardship. On the floor beside her stood a shabby leather bag. \"What can I do for you, my girl?\" Patricia asked, in French. The woman replied eagerly. \"I am starving, mademoiselle. I have but just arrived from Paris. I was there employed, as seamstress, in one of the great houses which make the costumes, the gowns. Now there is no more work. The proprietor has gone with the 72\nTHE WEB \n\n73 army. The place is closed. I must live, mademoiselle, and so I came to your so great city to find work. I sew very well, mademoiselle. Can you not perhaps employ me?\" \"What is your name?\" Patricia asked, coldly. \"Violette, mademoiselle. Violette Mercier.\" \"You have your passport, your credentials?” \"Oh, but yes, mademoiselle. They are here. You will look at them, yes?\" She hastily opened her satchel, and taking out a package of papers, thrust them into Patricia's hand. The latter examined them with deliberate care. She felt sorry for this creature, homeless, alone, cast by the necessities of a senseless war upon the mercy of strangers. Also, by some curious fate, it happened that Lady Brooke's regular seamstress had, but the day before, announced that she had received a splendid offer to accompany a wealthy American woman to New York, and would her ladyship be so good as to permit her to go. Miss Martin, the former seamstress, had been an efficient and honest servant, but when, with bulging eyes, she announced the wages that had been offered her, Lady Brooke had let her go at once. She thought it rather a shabby trick on the part of the girl's prospective employer, but then, being an American herself, she understood. THE WEB \n\nIt did not occur to Patricia's unsuspicious nature, that there could be any connection between \n\nMiss Martin's departure on one day, and the arrival, so providentially, of Mademoiselle Mercier, also a seamstress, on the next. The coincidence, if it struck her at all, impressed her as being rather fortunate than otherwise. She summoned Patrick, ordered him to conduct the young woman to the servants' hall and give her something to eat, then, going to the library, showed the girl's papers, which she had retained, to her brother and his wife. \"You know, Nelly,\" she said to Lady Brooke, \"we've been wondering where on earth we could find anyone to take Martin's place, and now we have a chance to get a real French milliner, who has been making gowns and things at one of the big Parisian costumers. It's the luckiest thing in the world, don't you think?\" \"Where is the woman?\" Lady Brooke asked. \"I told Patrick to see that she had something to eat. She looked half-starved.\" Lord Brooke, meanwhile, had been examining the papers."}

The lines were identical He handed the slip of paper back to her. \"I am satisfied,\" he said. \"Good. You see that I trust you fully, otherwise I would not put myself in your hands.

Now that we fully understand each other, kindly let me have the information you secured today.\" \"By all means. But I'm afraid it is n't very important. The transport Aspermoor leaves Southampton day after tomorrow, conveyed by two destroyers.\" The girl's eyes gleamed. She took a gold pencil from her pocketbook, and wrote a few words upon a card within it. \"Not very important!\" she exclaimed. \"My friend, it is invaluable. In spite of all our efforts, we have been unable to gain any advance information regarding the English transport service to France. Our submarines have been blind. They have not yet succeeded in sinking a single troop-ship. Think what it will mean, to send a whole regiment to the bottom!\" Hoffman thought. The idea filled him with horror. For an instant he was tempted to take the woman by her slender neck and strangle her. What was her life, compared with that of thousands? Despicable work, indeed. Then the knowledge of a great, though to him inexplicable purpose, rose in his mind. The interview he\nTHE WEB \n\n121 had had with the man with the piercing grey eyes, just before his journey to Rotterdam, recurred to him with irresistible force. He had been told to obey, blindly, implicitly, trusting to intelligences superior to his own. Even the sinking of a transport, horrifying as it might seem to him, was as nothing, compared with success in what he had undertaken. He composed his features, hoping that his companion had not observed his momentary weakness. She, however, was far too much occupied with her own thoughts, to pay attention to him. An almost satanic joy shone in her eyes. \"Two days,\" she repeated to herself. \"There will be time. The news will be in Antwerp before midnight. My friend, within fortyeight hours the transport Aspermoor will be at the bottom of the English Channel.” \"Then you think Herr Schwartz will be satisfied?\" Hoffman asked. \"He will be delighted. If you play your cards well, you can make your fortune. This \n\nLord Brooke is a fool. Almost too great a fool, at times. One is apt to be suspicious of information so freely given. But in forty-eight hours we shall know.\" \"Lord Brooke is certainly not a fool,\" Hoffman remarked gloomily. \"He trusts me, that is all. Do not forget that I am his wife's\nTHE WEB \n\n3 brother."}
