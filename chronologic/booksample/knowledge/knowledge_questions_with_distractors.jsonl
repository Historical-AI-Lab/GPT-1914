PHILOSOPHY: term whose meaning has grown beyond its original significance, which was 'love of knowledge,' and which implied a special taste, appetite, or desire, whose subject-matter was knowledge. At first, man's pursuit of knowledge was subservient to the immediate uses of life; but, in the course of time, an interest was taken in knowing the order of the world, independent of its application to the common utilities. We find that this stage had been reached in Greece, especially, about five or six centuries before Christ; at which time the name 'philosophy' took its rise, being attributed to Pythagoras. T, n. The pursuit of knowl edge had to become an end in itself; for the more improvement of practice would not at first have been a sufficient motive for men to undergo the labors of scien tific inquiry. Indeed, this improvement was not at all apparent as a consequence of the earliest efforts of speculation. As one celebrated example, the investigation of the properties of the sections of the cone-the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola-was without any practical use for nearly 2,000 years. A, v.). But, in the ancient world, this operation was a mixture of speculation, practice, and sentiment of legitimate inquiry with aspirations after the unattainable; hence the word P., in its modern use, often refers to the subjects that have not as yet adopted the strict scientific form.

His mind continuing to be disturbed by the unhappy condition of the masses of the people, he applied himself, during the intervals of his work, to consider means for their elevation, and became convinced that sound education was the remedy for the many evils which infested society. To give effect to his theories, he converted his own house into an orphan asylum, and endeavored, by judicious blending of industrial, intellectual, and moral training, to afford a specimen of sound education, so contrived as to be practicable as a national scheme.

I, a. Although the general distribution of the phosphates of the alkalies in the nutrient fluids (there is 40 per cent. of them in the ash of the blood-cells; 28:4 per cent. of phosphoric acid and 23.5 of potash in the ash of cows milk; and about 70 per cent. of phosphoric acid in the ash of the yolk of egg) is in itself an indication of their importance, the exact nature of their functions is not understood. Liebig has specially drawn attention to the peculiar grouping of the acid and alkaline fluids of the animal body. The permanence of this grouping is maintained, especially in herbivorous animals, chiefly by the conversion, within the body, of alkaline and neutral phosphates into acid phosphates by the means above described. Moreover, all tissue-forming substances (the protein bodies) are so closely connected with phosphates, that they remain associated during the solution and subsequent re-precipitation of these substances; and the ash of developed tissues (e.g., muscle, lung, liver, etc.) always affords evidence that acid phosphates existed in the recent tissue; and, further, no exudation from the blood-vessels can undergo transformation into cells and fibres, i.e., become organized, unless, in addition to other conditions, phosphates are present. Another convincing proof of the share taken by the phosphates in the formation and functions of the tissue is the fact that, though herbivorous animals take up a very small quantity of phosphates in their food, and though their blood is very poor in these salts, their tissues contain as large a proportion of phosphates as the corresponding parts of Carnivora. Lastly, the fact that one equivalent of the alkaline phosphate of soda (2Na\u2082O\u00b7H\u2082O\u00b7\u0420\u2082O) possesses the property of absorbing as much carbonic acid as two equivalents of carbonate of soda leads to the belief that the power of attracting carbonic acid, which the serum of the blood possesses, is due at least as much to the phosphate as to the carbonate of soda; and that, consequently, phosphate of soda has an important part in the respiratory process. Phosphate of Lime occurs in the organism in two formsviz., as the neutral or basic phosphate, 3CaO PO, and the acid phosphate, 2CaO H,OP.O. The neutral phosphate occurs in all the solids and fluids of the body, but is most abundant in the bones, in which it amounts to about 57 per cent., and in the enamel of the teeth, 80 to 90 per cent. It is remarkable that a salt so perfectly insoluble in water as neutral phosphate of lime can be held in solution in the animal fluids. In some fluids, e.g., the blood, it is probably, in part at least, combined with albumen, with which it forms a soluble compound; while in other fluids, e.g., the urine, it is held in solution by a free acid or by certain salts (e.g., chloride of", "source": "Columbian Cyclopedia, vol 23", "source_date": 1897, "source_htid": "hvd.hn5bs8", "question_category": "knowledge", "question_process": "automatic", "question_prefix": "In answering the following question, assume that it has been posed in 1897: ", "answer_types": ["ground_truth", "manual_distractor", "manual_distractor", "manual_distractor"]}

Pop. (1891) 17,500, PIETISM. PIETISM: interesting and powerful religious movement in the Lutheran Church in Germany, during the last part of the 17th and first half of the 18th c. The term Pietists designates a religious party which, without forming a separate sect, had distinctive characteristics in opinion and in procedure. It is still applied to the same or like tendencies of opinion, feeling, and conduct. P. may be regarded as consisting in an exaltation of the importance of religious feeling and of godly practice, with a corresponding depreciation of doctrinal differences that do not concern the simple fundamental Christianity; and with a contempt for, or, at best, respectful indifference to, outward ecclesiastical arrangements. P. has been more or less strongly developed from time to time in all sections of the church; as the tendency toward it always exists in a large class of earnestly religious minds. This tendency has taken sometimes a disproportionate development. In the church of the middle ages, it was displayed in an endeavor to attain superior spirituality and purity by religious contemplation and asceticism; and many persons, consequently, embraced a monastic life. The Reformers, adopting the Augustinian doctrines, rejected this external mode of seeking deliverance from indwelling sin, and proclaimed the efficacy of faith in the sacrifice of Christ. But the' controversies which arose among them, and increased among their successors, gradually gave a too exclusively doctrinal and polemical character to the sermons and writings both of the Lutheran and of the Calvinistic divines, particularly in Germany; and a reaction ensued, not at all toward the Church of Rome, but in favor of a religion of pious feeling and good works, or of the heart and life. Disgust at the sectarian bitterness and exclusiveness which prevailed led even to an undervaluing of disputed points; thus the Pietism of Germany was generated and developed. Its origin is referred to a work, Vom wahren Christenthume, by John Arnd, 1605; to the Invitatio Fraternitatis Christi of John Val. Andre\u00e6, 1617, both Lutherans; and to the writings of Cocceius, a C, v.), in the latter part of the 17th c., and to his friends and disciples. The name Pietists was given first in contempt to certain young docents in Leipzig, who began 1689 to give prelections on the New Test. both to students and to citizens, and to addict themselves to a meditative mode of life. Spener had held meetings somewhat similar in his own house when preacher at Frankfurt-on-the-Main, and in his writings had urged the necessity of a reform in the Prot. Church and theology.

Paper so treated is extremely sensitive to light, so that when a fern-leaf, e.g., is placed close down upon it between two plates of glass, the paper blackens except where it is covered; thus a reversed picture, or silhouette of the leaf in white, on a black ground, is obtained. This negative was then placed over another sheet of paper, prepared in the same way, and the light allowed to act through it, Another picture of PHOTOGRAPHY. the leaf was thus produced, but this time with the lights and shades unreversed; in other words, a positive print, or silhouette in black, on a white ground, was got.

The Calotype process was patented by Fox Talbot 1841 it is sometimes called the Talbotype process. He had now so far perfected a photographic process that the steps in it remain practically the same to the present day, though the materials used differ to some extent. Talbot produced his negative by preparing paper on the surface with iodide of silver, subsequently washing it over with a mixture of nitrate of silver, with gallic and acetic acids, and then exposing it in the camera to the object that he wished to copy. The invisible image or picture thus obtained was developed by aceto-nitrate of silver and gallic acid, and fixed with bromide of potassium.

A thin, flat box with a sliding shutter, together called a plateholder,' contains the sensitized plate. Generally, plateholders are arranged to contain two plates: such are provided with two sliding shutters, one on each face. When the picture is focused, the screen is withdrawn, and the plateholder inserted in its place; the shutter is then drawn out, and the sensitized plate, which exactly occupies the place of the glass screen, being now exposed, receives the picture. In a brief time, which now varies from a fraction of one second to several seconds in a good light, the shutter is closed, and the plateholder returned to a dark room, where the plate is taken out and developed. For general purposes, it is desirable that the camera should be as portable as possible, consistent with strength; consequently it is made usually in the bellows form, so that it will fold into small space.

In the same way the milt was taken from the male. The pressing operation was repeated at intervals several times. The eggs were then well mixed with the milt, and the water changed so as to be constantly fresh. The fecundation being completed, the eggs were placed for security in a covered vessel. This was originally of zinc, perforated with small holes, and had a layer of gravel on the bottom. A limited number of eggs were inclosed in the box, and the box placed in a current of pure water and covered with pebbles, care being taken to let the water pass freely through, as it is necessary for the eggs to be slightly agitated. The hatching takes place in two to four months, the time depending on the nature of the water and other circumstances.
