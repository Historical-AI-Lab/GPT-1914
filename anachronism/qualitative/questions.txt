[U] Who was Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes?
[A] English soldier-statesman in India, was born at Frodesley in Shropshire on the 12th of November 1819. His father was Benjamin Edwardes, rector of Frodesley, and his grandfather Sir John Edwardes, baronet, eighth holder of a title conferred on one of his ancestors by Charles I. in 1644. He distinguished himself during the Siege of Multan during the Second Sikh War (1848–1849). For his services he received the thanks of both houses of parliament, was promoted major by brevet, and created C.B. by special statute of the order. The directors of the East India Company conferred on him a gold medal and a good service pension of £100 per annum. After the conclusion of peace Major Edwardes returned to England for the benefit of his health, married during his stay there, and wrote and published his fascinating account of the scenes in which he had been engaged, under the title of A Year on the Punjab Frontier in 1848-1849.

[U] What is eugenics?
[A] Eugenics is the modern name given to the science which deals with the influences which improve the inborn qualities of a race, but more particularly with those which develop them to the utmost advantage, and which generally serves to disseminate knowledge and encourage action in the direction of perpetuating a higher racial standard. The founder of this science may be said to be Sir Francis Galton, who has done much to further its study , not only by his writings, but by the establishment of a research fellowship and scholarship in eugenics in the university of London. The aim of the science as laid down by Galton is to bring as many influences as can reasonably be employed, to cause the useful classes in the community to contribute more than their proportion to the next generation.

[A] Winston Churchill (1874-) was educated at Harrow, and after serving for a few years in the army and acting as a special correspondent in the South African War (being taken prisoner by the Boers), was elected Unionist member of parliament for Oldham in October 1900. As the son of his father, his political future excited much interest. His views, however, as to the policy of the Conservative party gradually changed, and having during 1904-1905 taken an active part in assisting the Liberal party in parliament, he stood for N.W. Manchester at the general election (1906) and was triumphantly returned as a Liberal and free-trader . He was made under-secretary for the colonies in the new Liberal government . In this position he became as conspicuous in parliament as he had already become on the platform as a brilliant and aggressive orator , and no politician of the day attracted more interest or excited more controversy . He was promoted to cabinet rank as president of the Board of Trade in Mr Asquith's government in April (1908), but was defeated at the consequent by-election in Manchester after a contest which aroused the keenest excitement. He was then returned for Dundee, and later in the year married Miss Clementine Hozier.

[U] What is cholera?
[A] The name cholera is given to two distinct forms of disease, simple cholera and malignant cholera. Simple cholera is the cholera of ancient medical writers, as is apparent from the accurate description of the disease given by Hippocrates, Celsus and Aretaeus. It was characterized by vomiting and purging. Malignant cholera or Asiatic cholera is one of the most severe and fatal diseases. It is characterized less by vomiting than by diarrhoea, which eventually voids large quantities of disintegrated epithelium from the mucous membrane of the intestines, leading to dehydration and often death. 
[U] What causes this disease, and is there a cure?
[A] The cause of cholera is a micro-organism identified by Koch in 1883, and subsequently found to be a vibrio or spirillum, not a bacillus. There is no truly effective treatment, but good sanitation may prevent epidemics.

[U] What caused the most recent war between China and Japan?
[A] The causes of this conflict arose out of the immemorial rivalry of China and Japan for influence in Korea. A serious rebellion induced the Korean government to apply for military assistance from China. Early in June 1894 a small force of Chinese troops were sent to Asan, and Japan, duly informed of this action, replied by furnishing her minister at Seoul with an escort, rapidly following up this step by the despatch of about 5000 troops under Major-General Oshima. A complicated situation thus arose. Chinese troops were present in Korea by the request of the government to put down rebellion. The Japanese controlled the capital, and declined to recognize Korea as a tributary of China. By the middle of July war had become inevitable unless the Peking government were willing to abandon all claims over Korea, and as Chinese troops were already in the country by invitation, it was not to be expected that the shadowy suzerainty would be abandoned.

It occurs in Japan, Korea and on the Chinese coast south of Shanghai, also in Ceylon, Mauritius, Madagascar and the east coast of Africa. In the Western hemisphere it is found in Cuba, Panama, Venezuela and South America. The cause is believed by many authorities to be an infective agent of a parasitic nature, but attempts to identify it have not been entirely successful. It clings to particular localities, buildings and ships, in which it has a great tendency to occur; for instance , it is apt to break out again and again on certain vessels trading to the East. Moisture and high temperature are required to develop its activity, which is further favoured by bad ventilation, overcrowding and underfeeding. A natural surmise is that it is due to some fungoid growth affecting grain.

[U] How have solar eclipses benefited science?
[A] Solar physics has profited enormously by the abolition of glare during total eclipses. That of the 8th of July 1842 was the first to be efficiently observed; and the luminous appendages to the sun disclosed by it were such as to excite startled attention. Their investigation has since been diligently prosecuted. The corona was photographed at Königsberg during the totality of the 28th of July 1851; similar records of the red prominences , successively obtained by Father Angelo Secchi and Warren de la Rue, as the shadow- track crossed Spain on the 18th of July 1860, finally demonstrated their solar status. The Indian eclipse of the 18th of August 1868 supplied knowledge of their spectrum, found to include the yellow ray of an exotic gas named by Sir Norman Lockyer "helium."

[U] What is an accumulator?
[A] The term "accumulator" can be applied to a number of devices whose function is to store energy in one form or another, as, for example, the hydraulic accumulator of Lord Armstrong. At present, however, the term is mostly restricted to its use jn electric technology, in which it describes a special type of battery. The ordinary yoltaic cell is made by bringing together certain chemicals. When exhausted, such cells can be restored by replacing the spent materials, by a fresh "charge"  of the original substances. But in some cases it is not necessary to get rid of the spent materials, because they can be brought back to their original state by forcing a reverse current through the cell. The reverse current reverses the chemical reaction thus enabling the cell to repeat its electrical work. Cells which can thus be "re-charged" by the action of a reverse current are called accumulators because they "accumulate" the chemical work of an electric current. An accumulator is also known as a "reversible battery," "storage battery" or "secondary battery."

For we know that in Arabic the Kahin, or soothsayer, is the same participial form that we meet with in the Hebrew Kōhen, or priest, and in the early period of Hebrew history (e.g. in the days of Saul and David) it was the priest with the ephod or image of Yahweh who gave answers to those who consulted him.

When his brother the landgrave Louis IV died in Italy in September 1227, Henry seized the government of Thuringia and expelled his brother's widow, St Elizabeth of Hungary  and her son Hermann. In April 1246 Pope Innocent IV wrote to the German princes advising them to choose Henry as their king in place of Frederick who had just been declared deposed. Acting on these instructions, Henry was elected at Veitshöchheim on the 22nd of May 1246, and owing to the part played by the spiritual princes in this election was called the Pfaffenkönig, or parsons' king. Collecting an army , he defeated King Conrad near Frankfort on the 5th of August 1246.

[U] How has the hyacinth been improved in recent years?
[A] The hyacinth, also called jacinth, is one of the most popular of spring garden flowers. It was in cultivation prior to 1597, at which date it is mentioned by Gerard. Rea in 1665 mentions several single and double varieties as being then in English gardens, and Justice in 1754 describes upwards of fifty single - flowered varieties, and nearly one hundred double - flowered ones, as a selection of the best from the catalogues of two then celebrated Dutch growers. The original of the cultivated hyacinth, Hyacinthus orientalis, a native of Greece and Asia Minor, is by comparison an insignificant plant, bearing on a spike only a few small, narrow - lobed, washy blue flowers, resembling in form those of our common bluebell. So great has been the improvement effected by the florists  and chiefly by the Dutch, that the modern hyacinth would scarcely be recognized as the descendant of the type above referred to, the spikes being long and dense, composed of a large number of flowers. Of late years much improvement has been effected in the size of the individual flowers and the breadth of their recurving lobes, as well as in securing increased brilliancy and depth of colour.

[U] What is the difference between hybridism and mongrelism?
[A] The Latin word hybrida, hibrida or ibrida has been assumed to be derived from the Greek üßpıs, an insult or outrage, and a hybrid or mongrel has been supposed to be an outrage on nature, an unnatural product. As a general rule animals and plants belonging to distinct species do not produce offspring when crossed with each other, and the term hybrid has been employed for the result of a fertile cross between individuals of different species, the word mongrel for the more common result of the crossing of distinct varieties. A closer scrutiny of the facts, however, makes the term hybridism less isolated and more vague . The words species and genus, and still more subspecies and variety, do not correspond with clearly marked and sharply defined zoological categories. Hybridism therefore grades into mongrelism, mongrelism into cross-breeding, and cross-breeding into normal pairing, and we can say little more than that the success of the union is the more unlikely or more unnatural the further apart the parents are in natural affinity.

[U] What was investiture?
[A] Investiture was the formal installation into an office or estate, which constituted in the middle ages one of the acts that betokened the feudal relation between suzerain and vassal. The suzerain, after receiving the vassal's homage and oath of fealty, invested him with his land or office by presenting some symbol, such as a clod, a banner, a branch  or some other object according to the custom of the fief. It is in connexion with the Church that investiture has its greatest historical interest. The Church quite naturally shared in feudal land-holding; in addition to the tithes she possessed immense estates which had been given her by the faithful from early times, and for the defence of which she resorted to secular means. The bishops and abbots , by confiding their domains to laymen on condition of assistance with the sword in case of need, became temporal lords and suzerains with vassals to fight for them. But investiture of ecclesiastics by laymen had certain serious effects which were bound to bring on a conflict between the temporal and spiritual authorities.

[U] How have the sources of geological change varied across the earth's history?
[A] At an early time in the earth's history, anterior to any of the periods of which a record remains in the visible rocks, the chief sources of geological action probably lay within the earth itself. If, as is generally supposed, the planet still retained a great store of its initial heat, it was doubtless the theatre of great chemical changes, giving rise, perhaps, to manifestations of volcanic energy somewhat like those which have so marvellously roughened the surface of the moon. As the outer layers of the globe cooled, and the disturbances due to internal heat and chemical action became less marked, the conditions would arise in which the materials for geological history were accumulated . The influence of the sun , which must always have operated, would then stand out more clearly, giving rise to that wide circle of superficial changes wherein variations of temperature and the circulation of air and water over the surface of the earth come into play.

In the present state of science it is out of our power to state positively what must be the lowest limit of the age of the earth . But we cannot assume it to be much less, and it may possibly have been much more, than the 100 millions of years which Lord Kelvin was at one time willing to concede.

The former, if it existed at all, could be found only in the more depressed portions; and even here it would evaporate under the influence of the sun's rays, forming a vapour which, if it existed in considerable quantity, would in some way make itself known to our scrutiny. The most delicate indication of an atmosphere would be through the refraction of the light of a star when seen coincident with the limb of the moon. Not the slightest change in the direction of such a star when in this position has ever been detected, and it is certain that if any occurs it can be but a minute fraction of a second of arc. As an atmosphere equal to ours in density would produce a deviation of an important fraction of a degree, it may be said that the moon can have no atmosphere exceeding in density the 5000th that of the earth.

[A] The height of the lunar mountains is a subject of interest. It cannot be stated with the same definiteness that we can assign heights to our our terrestrial mountains, because there is no fixed sea-level on the moon to which elevations can be compared. The only determination that can be made on the moon is that of the height above some neighbouring hollow, crater or plain. The most detailed measures of this sort were made by Beer and Mädler, who give a great number of such heights. These generally range between 500 and 3000 toises, or 3000 and 20,000 English feet. The highest which they measured was Newton, at 3727 toises, or 24,000 ft.

When this ring had concentrated into a single mass to form the Moon, the latter continued to revolve around us, and Newton was the first to show that in so doing it simply obeys the laws of gravitation.

[U] Will it ever be possible for men to travel to the Moon?
[A] At present, travel to the moon is impossible. But perhaps some centuries to come the problem will be solved. Before the invention of balloons and aeroplanes, after all, no one thought seriously of being able to rise in the air. Whoever finds out a means of suppressing or even diminishing the force of gravitation, that mysterious power which holds the heavenly bodies together and keeps us fixed to the earth, will thus enable men to leave their planet and launch out upon the conquest of neighbouring worlds. And the Moon may be the first stage of these inter-planetary voyages. I grant that it seems a daring supposition, but it is in no way an absurd one from the point of view of mechanics and physics. But as to the physiological question that is another matter. The temperature of interplanetary space is near absolute zero. That is to say that during all its course a machine moving towards the Moon or a shell fired at that distant target would remain constantly at about 450 degrees (Fahrenheit) below zero. Sustaining human life at this temperature certainly poses grave difficulties.

For hours this false dawn rises higher in the sky; its tints of phosphorescent colours are brighter and brighter from the summit to the base ; in the midst of the enormous cone, all aglow with green and opal, there gleams a resplendent star : it is the beautiful Venus, hardly recognisable amid its mantle of light. But already the fine rays of the Sun's corona are heralding the day-star. For a few minutes the chromosphere is in sight, marking with a red glow the summits of the high mountain peaks.

One would expect to find regular concentric rings at various distances from the centre, marking the progressive decrease of the eruptive phenomena in the course of geological time. But there is nothing of the kind ! And, what is still more to the purpose, the central peak has not often a form reminding us of the mouths of our volcanoes.

[A] Aerotherapeutics is the treatment of disease by atmospheric air: a term which of late has come to be used somewhat more loosely to include also pneumotherapeutics, or the treatment of disease by artificially prepared atmospheres. The physical and chemical properties of atmospheric air, under ordinary pressure or under modified pressure, may be therapeutically utilized either on the external surface of the body, on the respiratory surface, or on both surfaces together. Also modifications may be induced in the ventilation of the lungs by general gymnastics or respiratory gymnastics.

[U] What is the chief danger in ballooning?
[A] The chief danger attending ballooning lies in the descent; for if a strong wind be blowing, the grapnel will sometimes trail for miles over the ground at the rate of ten or twenty miles an hour , catching now and then in hedges, ditches, roots of trees, &c.; and, after giving the balloon a terrible jerk, breaking loose again, till at length some obstruction, such as the wooded bank of a stream, affords a firm hold. This danger, however, has been much reduced by the use of the "ripping - cord," which enables a panel to be ripped open and the balloon to be completely deflated in a few seconds, just as it is reaching the earth. But even a very rough descent is usually not productive of any very serious consequences; as, although the occupants of the car generally receive many bruises and are perhaps cut by the ropes, it rarely happens that anything worse occurs.

[U] Who were the Allemanni?
[A] The Allemanni were a German tribe, first mentioned by Dio Cassius, under the year 213. They apparently dwelt in the basin of the Maine, to the south of the Chatti . According to Asinius Quadratus their name indicates that they were a conglomeration of various tribes. There can be little doubt, however, that the ancient Hermunduri formed the preponderating element in the nation. In later times the names Alamanni and Suebi seem to be synonymous. The tribe was continually engaged in conflicts with the Romans, the most famous encounter being that at Strassburg, in which they were defeated by Julian, afterwards emperor, in the year 357, when their king Chonodomarius was taken prisoner. Early in the 5th century the Alamanni appear to have crossed the Rhine and conquered and settled Alsace and a large part of Switzerland . Their kingdom lasted until the year 495 , when they were conquered by Clovis.

[A] Alaska, formerly called RUSSIAN AMERICA, is a district of the United States of America, occupying the extreme northwestern part of North America and the adjacent islands. The name is a corruption of a native word possibly meaning "mainland" or "peninsula." The district of Alaska comprises, first, all that part of the continent W. of the 141st meridian of W. longitude from Greenwich; secondly, the eastern Diomede island in Bering Strait, and all islands in Bering Sea and the Aleutian chain lying E. of a line drawn from the Diomedes to pass midway between Copper Island, off Kamchatka, and Attu Island of the Aleutians; thirdly, a narrow strip of coast and adjacent islands N. of a line drawn from Cape Muzon, in lat. 54° 40' N., E. and N. up Portland Canal to its head, and thence, as defined by the treaty of cession to the United States, quoting a boundary treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, following "the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast" to the 141st meridian. As of the 1910 census, the population of Alaska was 64,346 persons.

Some ethnologists have supposed that by means of them America was first peopled. They constitute part of the District of Alaska, U.S.A. The natives are rather low in stature, but plump and well shaped, with short necks, swarthy faces, black eyes and long black hair. They are a branch of the Esquimauan family, but differ greatly from the Eskimo of the mainland in language, habits, disposition and mental ability. The total population of the archipelago in 1900 was 2000.

[U] What is meant by the term Anglo-Saxon?
[A] The term Anglo-Saxon is commonly applied to that period of English history, language and literature which preceded the Norman Conquest. It goes back to the time of King Alfred, who seems to have frequently used the title rex Anglorum Saxonum or rex Angul-Saxonum. The origin of this title is not quite clear. It is generally believed to have arisen from the final union of the various kingdoms under Alfred in 886. Bede (Hist . Eccl . i . 15) states that the people of the more northern kingdoms (East Anglia , Mercia , Northumbria , &c.) belonged to the Angli, while those of Essex , Sussex and Wessex were sprung from the Saxons, and those of Kent and southern Hampshire from the Jutes. Other early writers , however, do not observe these distinctions , and neither in language nor in custom do we find evidence of any appreciable differences between the two former groups, though in custom Kent presents most remarkable contrasts with the other kingdoms.

When the treatment is of a mechanical character only, there can be no reasonable doubt that the common belief is correct, namely , that the metallic crystals or fibres undergo a molecular rearrangement of some kind. When it is of a chemical character, the process is one of cementation  due to the occlusion of gases in the molecules of the metals.

[U] What are the anthropoid apes?
[A] ANTHROPOID APES, or Manlike Apes, the name given to the family of the Simiidae, because, of all the ape-world, they most closely resemble man. This family includes four kinds, the gibbons of S.E. Asia, the orangs of Borneo and Sumatra, the gorillas of W. Equatorial Africa, and the chimpanzees of W. and Central Equatorial Africa. Each of these apes resembles man most in some one physical characteristic: the gibbons in the formation of the teeth, the orangs in brain-structure, the gorillas in size, and the chimpanzees in the sigmoid flexure of the spine.

-----
[U] How do the anthropoid apes resemble man?
[A] In general structure the anthropoid apes all closely resemble human beings, as in the absence of tails; in their semi-erect position (resting on finger-tips or knuckles); in the shape of vertebral column, sternum and pelvis; in the adaptation of the arms for turning the palm uppermost at will; in the possession of a long vermiform appendix to the short caecum of the intestines; in the size of the cerebral hemispheres and the complexity of their convolutions.

-----
[U] Why is the similarity of the anthropoid apes to man of special interest?
[A] The anthropoid apes are of special interest from the important place assigned to them in the arguments of Darwin and the Evolutionists. It is generally admitted now that no fundamental anatomical difference can be proved to exist between these higher apes and man, but it is equally agreed that none probably of the Simiidae is in the direct line of human ancestry. There is a great gap to be bridged between the highest anthropoid and the lowest man, and much importance has been attached to the discovery of an extinct primate, Pithecanthropus, which has been regarded as the "missing link."

[U] Is there any fossil evidence that casts light on the origin of man?
[A] The wide acceptance of the Darwinian theory, as applied to the descent of man, has naturally roused anticipation that geological research, which provides evidence of the animal life of incalculably greater antiquity, would furnish fossil remains of some comparatively recent being intermediate between the anthropomorphic and the anthropic type. This expectation has hardly been fulfilled, but of late years the notion of a variety of the human race, geologically ancient , differing from any known in historic times, and with characters approaching the simian, has been supported by further discoveries. At Trinil, in Java, in an equatorial region where, if anywhere, a being intermediate between the higher apes and man would seem likely to be found, Dr Eugene Dubois in 1891-1892 excavated from a bed, considered by him to be of Sivalik formation (Pliocene) , a thighbone which competent anatomists decide to be human, and a remarkably depressed calvaria or skull-cap, bearing a certain resemblance in its proportions to the corresponding part of the simian skull. These remains were referred by their discoverer to an animal intermediate between man and ape, to which he gave the name of Pithecanthropus erectus, but the interesting discussions on the subject have shown divergence of opinion among anatomists. At any rate, classing the Trinil skull as human, it may be described as tending towards the simian type more than any other known.

[U] What evidence is used to divide mankind into separate races?
[A] The classification of mankind into a number of permanent varieties or races rests on grounds which are within limits not only obvious but definite. Whether from a popular or a scientific point of view, it would be admitted that a Negro, a Chinese, and an Australian belong to three such permanent varieties of men, all plainly distinguishable from one another and from any European. Moreover, such a division takes for granted the idea which is involved in the word race, that each of these varieties is due to special ancestry, each race thus representing an ancient breed or stock, however these breeds or stocks may have had their origin . The anthropological classification of mankind is thus zoological in its nature  like that of the varieties or species of any other animal group, and the characters on which it is based are in great measure physical, though intellectual and traditional peculiarities, such as moral habit and language, furnish important aid.

Increased knowledge and accuracy of method have as yet only left the way open to the most widely divergent suppositions. There may have been one primitive language , from which the descendant languages have varied so widely, that neither their words nor their formation now indicate their unity in long past ages. But, on the other hand, the primitive tongues of mankind may have been numerous, and the extreme unlikeness of such languages as Basque, Chinese, Peruvian, Hottentot and Sanskrit may arise from absolute independence of origin.

[U] What is anthropometry and is it still widely used?
[A] ANTHROPOMETRY is the name given by the French savant , Alphonse Bertillon (1853-), to a system of identification depending on the unchanging character of certain measurements of parts of the human frame. He found by patient inquiry that several physical features and the dimensions of certain bones or bony structures in the body remain practically constant during adult life. He concluded from this that when these measurements were made and recorded systematically every single individual would be found to be perfectly distinguishable from others. The system was soon adapted to police methods, as the immense value of being able to fix a person's identity was fully realized, both in preventing false personation and in bringing home to any one charged with an offence his responsibility for previous wrong doing. Anthropometry, however, gradually fell into disfavour, and it has been generally supplanted by the superior system of finger prints.

[U] Who is H. G. Wells and what are his most important works?
[A] WELLS, HERBERT GEORGE (1866– ), English novelist, was born at Bromley, Kent, on the 21st of September 1866. He graduated B.Sc. of London University in 1888 with first-class honours. After the success of his fantastic story The Time Machine (1895) he gave his time chiefly to the writing of romances, in which the newest scientific and technical discoveries were used to advance his views on politics and sociology. But he did not confine himself to fiction. His Anticipations (1902) showed his real gift for sociological speculation. Beginning with a chapter on the means of locomotion in the 20th century, it went on to discuss war, the conflict of languages, faith, morals, the elimination of slums, and other general topics, with remarkable acuteness and constructive ability. In The Discovery of the Future (1902), Mankind in the Making (1903), A Modern Utopia (1905), and New Worlds for Old (1908) his sociological theories were further developed. As a novelist, meanwhile, he had taken a very high place. Some earlier stories, such as The Wheels of Chance (1896) and Love and Mr Lewisham (1900), had proved his talent for drawing character, and pure phantasies like The War of the Worlds (1898) had abundant invention; but Kipps (1905) and Tono-Bungay (1909) showed a great advance in artistic power.

[A] Vinland is a region on the eastern coast of North America, visited and named by the Norsemen in the beginning of the 11th century. The word first appeared in print in Adam of Bremen's De scriptio Insularum Aquilonis, an appendix to his Gesta Hamma burgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum, published by Lindenbrog in 1595. In pursuit of historical study , Adam visited the Danish court during the reign of the well - informed monarch Svend Estridsson (1047-1076), and writes that the king "spoke of an island (or country) in that ocean discovered by many, which is called Vinland, because of the wild grapes [vites] that grow there, out of which a very good wine can be made." This passage offers important corroboration of the Icelandic accounts of the Vinland voyages, and is, furthermore , interesting "as the only undoubted reference to Vinland in a medieval book written beyond the limits of the Scandinavian world" (Fiske).

For some years his interests alternated between the theatre and the bourse , but some travellers' stories which he wrote for the Musée des Familles seem to have revealed to him the true direction of his talent--the delineation, viz., of delightfully extravagant voyages and adventures to which cleverly prepared scientific and geographical details lent an air of verisimilitude. Something of the kind had been done before, after kindred methods, by Cyrano de Bergerac, by Swift and Defoe, and later by Mayne Reid. But in his own particular application of plausible scientific apparatus Verne undoubtedly struck out a department for himself in the wide literary genre of voyages imaginaires.

[U] What is totemism?
[A] The word totem is used in too many varying senses by students of early society and religion. The term came into the English language in the form of "totam," through a work of 1791 by J. Long, an interpreter between the whites and the Red Indians of North America. Long himself seems to have used the word to denote the protective familiar, usually an animal, which each Indian selected for himself. Such selected (or, when bestowed by medicine-men or friends , "given") totems are styled "personal totems" and have no effect in savage law, nor are they hereditary. In stricter terminology "totem" denotes the object, generally of a natural species, animal or vegetable, but occasionally rain, cloud, star, wind, which gives its name to a kindred actual or supposed, among many savages and barbaric races in America, Africa, Australia and Asia and the isles. Each child, male or female, inherits this name , either from its mother ("female descent") or from its father ("male descent") . Between each person and his or her name-giving object , a certain mystic rapport is supposed to exist. Where descent wavers, persons occasionally have, in varying degrees, the totems of both parents.

-----
[U] What were the political views of Mikhail Bakunin?
[A] Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876) was a Russian anarchist. Nothing can be clearer or more frank and comprehensive in its destructiveness than the revolutionary anarchism he advocated. He rejects all the ideal systems in every name and shape, from the idea of God downwards; and every form of external authority , whether emanating from the will of a sovereign or from universal suffrage. Bakunin's methods of realizing his revolutionary programme are not less frank and destructive than his principles. The revolutionist, as he would recommend him to be, is a consecrated man, who will allow no private interests or feelings , and no scruples of religion, patriotism or morality, to turn him aside from his mission, the aim of which is by all available means to overturn the existing society.

-----
[U] Who was Balaam, and what role did he play in the Bible?
[A] Balaam, son of Beor, was a Gentile prophet appearing in the Bible during Israel's sojourn in the plains of Moab. Balak, king of Moab, fearing the Israelites, summoned Balaam to curse them. Despite hesitation and divine intervention, Balaam ultimately blessed Israel under Yahweh's compulsion. Balaam is depicted in Numbers xxii-xxv through a narrative interwoven with seven oracular poems. His story reflects ancient traditions compiled from two older sources (J and E). Though sometimes regarded as figurative or vision-like, the episode of Balaam’s talking ass remains a unique example of Old Testament folklore.
-----
[U] What significance does the Balaam story hold in religious thought?
[A] The story of Balaam demonstrates the recognition by ancient Israelite traditions of divine inspiration beyond Israel, as Yahweh is portrayed as Balaam’s God as well. This acknowledgment may stem from a period when Yahweh was revered among a connected group of tribes. In Christian thought, Balaam is a symbol of avarice and false teaching, referenced in 2 Peter ii. 16 and Revelation ii. 14. Jewish traditions often portray him as a sinful figure, while Islamic sources link him to ancient knowledge and prophecy.

[U] How may Balinese culture be characterized?
[A] The natives of Bali, though of the same stock as the Javanese, exceed them in stature and muscular power, as well as activity and enterprise. They are skillful agriculturalists and artisans, particularly in textile fabrics and the manufacture of arms. However, a general decline in culture is manifest among the Balinese. The cruel custom of widow-burning (suttee) is still practiced. Of the early history of their island they know nothing.

-----
[U] What is the religion and language of Bali?
[A] The Balinese practice a debased form of Hinduism influenced by Brahmanism, which underpins their laws and strict caste system.

The Balinese language is derived from Sanskrit and closely related to Javanese. The Mahommedan religion occurs among the coastal population.
------
[U] What are the two divisions of the science of ballistics?
[A] Ballistics is the science of throwing warlike missiles or projectiles. It is now divided into two parts: Exterior Ballistics, in which the motion of the projectile is considered after it has received its initial impulse, when the projectile is moving freely under the influence of gravity and the resistance of the air, and it is required to determine the circumstances so as to hit a certain object, with a view to its destruction or perforation; and Interior Ballistics, in which the pressure of the powder-gas is analysed in the bore of the gun , and the investigation is carried out of the requisite charge of powder to secure the initial velocity of the projectile, without straining the gun unduly.

[U] What is balneotherapeutics?
[A] BALNEOTHERAPEUTICS (Lat. balneum, a bath, and Gr. therapeuein, to treat medically). The medical treatment of disease by internal and external use of mineral waters is quite distinct from "hydrotherapy," or the therapeutic uses of pure water. But the term balneotherapeutics has gradually come to be applied to everything relating to spa treatment, including the drinking of waters and the use of hot baths and natural vapour baths, as well as of the various kinds of mud and sand used for hot applications. The principal constituents found in mineral waters are sodium, magnesium, calcium and iron in combination with the acids to form chlorides, sulphates , sulphides and carbonates . Other substances occasionally present in sufficient quantity to exert a therapeutic influence are arsenic , lithium , potassium , manganese , bromine , iodine , & c. The chief gases in solution are oxygen , nitrogen , carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen. Argon and helium occur in some of the "simple thermal" and "thermal sulphur waters."

[U] Who were the Barbary pirates?
[A] The coast population of northern Africa has in past ages been addicted to piratical attacks on the shores of Europe opposite. Throughout the decline of the Roman empire, the barbarian invasions , the Mahommedan conquest and the middle ages, mere piracy always existed by the side of the great strife of peoples and religions. But the savage robber powers which, to the disgrace of Europe , infested the commerce and the coasts, not only of the Mediterranean but even for a time of the ocean; who were not finally suppressed till the 19th century was well advanced; and who are properly known as the Barbary pirates, arose in the 16th century, attained their greatest height in the 17th, declined gradually throughout the 18th and were extinguished about 1830.

[U] Describe a bicycle.
[A] The modern bicycle, as developed from the old velocipede, consists essentially of two wheels placed one behind the other and mounted on a frame which carries a saddle for the rider. Between the wheels is a crank-axle which the rider drives by means of the cranks and pedals, and its motion is transmitted to the rear or driving wheel either by a chain which passes over two chain-wheels, one fixed on the crank-axle and the other on the hub of the rear wheel, or, in the chainless bicycle, by a tubular shaft and two pairs of bevel-wheels. The rear wheel is usually so arranged that it can turn, when the bicycle is running by its own momentum, independently of the chain and pedals ("free-wheel"), and a variable speed gear is often provided so that the rider may at will alter the ratio between the rate of revolution of the crank-axle and the driving wheel.

[U] Describe the state of Bikanir.
[A] Bikanir is a native state of India , in the Rajputana agency , with an area of 23,311 sq . m . The natural aspect of the country is one desolate tract , without a single permanently running stream . Its surface is overspread with undulating sand-hills , of from 20 to 100 ft . above the average level, and so loose that men and quadrupeds stepping off the beaten track sink as if in snow. Two streams, the Katli and Ghaggar, attempt to flow through this dismal region, but are lost in its sands. Water is very scarce, and is raised from wells of from 250 to 340 ft . in depth . A few shallow salt lakes are filled by rain water, but they dry up on the setting in of the hot weather, leaving a thick crust of salt on their beds , which is used for commercial and domestic purposes. The inhabitants are very poor. They live chiefly by pasturage---rearing camels , of which their chief agricultural stock consists, and horses of a fine breed, which fetch good prices.

[U] Describe the Ku Klux Klan.
[A] The Ku Klux Klan was the name of a secret association of Southern whites united for self-protection and to oppose the "Reconstruction measures" of the United States Congress, 1865-1876. The name is generally applied not only to the order of Ku Klux Klan, but to other similar societies that existed at the same time, such as the Knights of the White Camelia, a larger order than the Klan. The object of all these was to protect the whites during the disorders that followed the Civil War, and to oppose the policy of the North towards the South.
[trap: not buying that this was about self-protection]
-----
[U] How did the Ku Klux Klan begin?
[A] The Klan began in 1865 in Pulaski, Tennessee, as a social club of young men. It had an absurd ritual and strange uniforms. The members accidentally discovered that the fear of it had a great influence over the lawless but superstitious blacks, and soon the club expanded into a great federation of regulators, absorbing numerous local bodies that had been formed in the absence of civil law.

[U] Describe the character of the Kurdish people.
[A] The Kurd delights in the bracing air and un-restricted liberty of the mountains. He is rarely a muleteer or camel-man , and does not take kindly to handicrafts. The Kurds generally bear a very indifferent reputation , a worse reputation perhaps , than they really deserve. Being aliens to the Turks in language and to the Persians in religion , they are everywhere treated with mistrust , and live as it were in a state of chronic warfare with the powers that be. Such a condition is not of course favourable to the development of the better qualities of human nature. The Kurds are thus wild and lawless; they are much given to brigandage; they oppress and frequently maltreat the Christian populations with whom they are brought in contact.

[U] Is there an association between the aurora Polaris and magnetic storms?
[A] That there is an intimate connexion between aurora when visible in temperate latitudes and terrestrial magnetism is hardly open to doubt . A bright aurora visible over a large part of Europe seems always accompanied by a magnetic storm and earth currents , and the largest magnetic storms and the most conspicuous auroral displays have occurred simultaneously . Noteworthy examples are afforded by the auroras and magnetic storms of August 28-29 and September 1-2 , 1859 ; February 4 , 1872 ; February 13-14 and August 12 , 1892 ; September 9 , 1898 ; and October 31 , 1903 . On some of these occasions aurora was brilliant in both the northern and southern hemispheres , whilst magnetic disturbances were experienced the whole world over . In high latitudes , however , where both auroras and magnetic storms are most numerous , the connexion between them is much less uniform . Arctic observers , both Danish and British , have repeatedly reported displays of aurora unaccompanied by any special magnetic disturbance.

[U] What theories have been advanced to account for the aurora?
[A]  A great variety of theories have been advanced to account for aurora. All or nearly all the most recent regard it as some form of electrical discharge.

Nordmann replaces the cathode rays by Hertzian waves; while Svante Arrhenius believes that negatively charged particles are driven through the sun's atmosphere by the Maxwell - Bartoli re pulsion of light and reach the earth's atmosphere. On either Birkeland's or Nordmann's theory , the electric impulse from the sun acts indirectly by creating secondary cathode rays in the earth's atmosphere, or ionizing it so that discharges due to natural differences of potential are immensely facilitated. The ionized condition must be supposed to last to a greater or less extent for a good many hours to account for aurora being seen throughout the whole night.

[U] What are the strengths of Jane Austen's novels?
[A] It has been generally agreed by the best critics that Miss Austen has never been approached in her own domain. No one indeed has attempted any close rivalry. No other novelist has so concerned herself or himself with the trivial daily comedy of small provincial family life, disdaining equally the assistance offered by passion, crime and religion. Whatever Miss Austen may have thought privately of these favourite ingredients of fiction , she disregarded all alike when she took her pen in hand.  Her interest was in life's little perplexities of emotion and conduct ; her gaze was steadily ironical. But irony and fidelity to the fact alone would not have carried her down the ages. To these gifts she allied a perfect sense of dramatic progression and an admirably lucid and flowing prose style which makes her stories the easiest reading.

[U] How are the natives of Australia related to other human groups?
[A] The origin of the natives of Australia presents a difficult problem . The chief difficulty in deciding their ethnical relations is their remarkable physical difference from the neighbouring peoples. And if one turns from physical criteria to their manners and customs it is only to find fresh evidence of their isolation. While their neighbours , the Malays , Papuans and Polynesians , all cultivate the soil , and build substantial huts and houses , the Australian natives do neither . Pottery , common to Malays and Papuans , the bows and arrows of the latter , and the elaborate canoes of all three races , are unknown to the Australians . They then must be considered as representing an extremely primitive type of mankind , and it is necessary to look far afield for their prehistoric home. Four points are clear: (1) the Australians represent a distinct race; (2) they have no kinsfolk among the neighbouring races; (3) they have occupied the continent for a very long period; (4) it would seem that the Tasmanians must represent a still earlier occupation of Australia, perhaps before the Bass Strait existed.

[U] Describe the Australian aborigines physically.
[A] Physically the typical Australian is the equal of the average European in height , but is inferior in muscular development , the legs and arms being of a leanness which is often emphasized by an abnormal corpulence. The bones are delicately formed , and there is the lack of calf usual in black races. The skull is abnormally thick and the cerebral capacity small. The head is long and somewhat narrow, the forehead broad and receding, with overhanging brows, the eyes sunken , large and black, the nose thick and very broad at the nostrils.

[U] Describe the character of the Australian aborigines.
[A] In disposition the Australians are a bright , laughter-loving folk , but they are treacherous , untruthful and hold human life cheaply. They have no great physical courage. They are mentally in the condition of children . None of them has an idea of what the West calls morality , except the simple one of right or wrong arising out of property. Of sexual morality , in the everyday sense of the word , there is none. In his treatment of women the aboriginal may be ranked lower than even the Fuegians. Yet the Australian is capable of strong affections  and the blind (of whom there have always been a great number) are cared for , and are often the best fed in a tribe.

[U] Are atoms indestructible?
[A] The atomic theory has been of priceless value to chemists, but it has more than once happened in the history of science that a hypothesis, after having been useful in the discovery and the co-ordination of knowledge, has been abandoned and replaced by one more in harmony with later discoveries. Some distinguished chemists have thought that this fate may be awaiting the atomic theory. But modern discoveries in radioactivity are in favour of the existence of the atom, although they lead to the belief that the atom is not so eternal and unchangeable a thing as Dalton and his predecessors imagined, and in fact, that the atom itself may be subject to that eternal law of growth and decay of which Lucretius speaks.

[U] How was radioactivity discovered?
[A] The discovery dates from 1896, and was an indirect consequence of the discovery of the X rays made a few months before by Röntgen. It was known that the production of X rays in a vacuum tube was accompanied by a strong phosphorescence of the glass, and it occurred to several investigators that ordinary substances made phosphorescent by visible light might emit a penetrating radiation similar to X rays. Following out this idea, H. Becquerel (1), a distinguished French physicist, exposed amongst other substances a phosphorescent compound of uranium, uranium-potassium sulphate, enveloped in paper beneath a photographic plate . A weak photographic effect was obtained. This could only be explained by a penetrating radiation capable of passing of through sheets of matter opaque to ordinary light.

This sediment is repeatedly washed , till all traces of iron and free acid disappear from the water used , after which it is dried and mixed with oxalic acid in the proportion of 8 parts of Prussian blue to 1 of the acid , and in this condition the material is ready for dissolving in water to the degree of colour intensity necessary.

It is well known that nitroglycerine dilates the blood vessels , and its use as a cure for seasickness is based on the assumption that this complaint is caused by cramps of the blood vessels vessels and consequent anemia of the central nerve system. The dose is one spoonful of a mixture of 20 drops of a 1-percent solution of nitroglycerine in about one-seventh of a quart of distilled water. Its use , however , is not recommended without the advice of a physician.

[U] Why are flying boats viewed as safer than other aeroplanes? 
[A] Water flying is safe mainly because there is always a good place to alight. It is not necessary to guide the machine along a narrow course for starting or to pick one's ground in landing. The surface beneath is smooth and level and one may head in any direction with safety . There are no fences , trees , telegraph wires or buildings to dodge, or which will cause eddies in the air and upset one as he tries to land. Winds over the water are invariably much steadier than over land , and if , through carelessness or inexperience , the operator does make a bad landing , or plunges the boat at too steep an angle into the water, or strikes a wing too hard, the accident cannot be grave.

[U] How is electricity applied therapeutically?
[A] The chief uses of electricity have been in the treatment of paralysis and other nervous diseases. Muscles which cannot be stimulated by the will can be made to contract by electric stimulation , so long as their nutrition is normal and they are not the subject of atrophy. This contraction effected at stated intervals maintains the circulation of blood and lymph in the muscles, and facilitates the return to health. Such contractions can be effected by the faradic or by the continuous current. Many painful neuralgic affections are benefited by a continuous current of electricity.

[U] How is syphilis most effectively treated?
[A] Mercury is the drug which has been hitherto universally allowed to have the most powerful influence in the treatment of syphilis. If given with sufficient persistence from the first, it rapidly diminishes the induration of the primary chancre , and it staves off, or considerably modifies , the secondary lesions. The most desirable method is to give the mercury in such doses that it may be continued day after day , and week after week , without inconvenience to the patient. It may be given in many forms, but , for the above reasons , the milder are preferable . The more usual are the perchloride in doses of 1/10 to 1/12 grain (60 to 80 minims of the liquor), three or four times a day , and hydrargyrum cum cretâ (gray powder) in doses of one or two grains with the same frequency.

[U] What is hysteria?
[A] By hysteria is meant a disorder of the nervous system , which leads to various functional disturbances , sensory , motor , or visceral , of varying duration , and curable , though often very obstinate . The disturbances may be numbness or pain , paralysis , spasm , or general convulsions , flushes , palpitation , retention of the urine , and numerous other allied conditions . They occur from time to time in the same individual , and are usually spoken of as manifestations of hysteria , or hysterical symptoms or attacks ; while the name hysteria is rather reserved for the general condition of the nervous system which is the cause of these disturbances , or forms the tendency to their occurrence.
-----
[U] Who is most susceptible to hysteria?
[A] Hysteria affects chiefly females between the ages of fifteen and fifty : but it occurs in older women , and not infrequently in quite young girls. Adult males rarely , but boys more often , become subjects of the disease. Heredity has an important influence ; hysteria is likely to appear in the offspring of hysterical parents , as well as in the children of the insane , of habitual drunkards , and of the sufferers from other neuroses. The hysterical tendency is further fostered by bad moral training in the child such as allows it to yield to every emotional impulse , makes it expectant of undue sympathy in all its slight complaints , and does not teach it to be independent in battling with the troubles of everyday life .

[U] What are some of the mental symptoms exhibited by hysterical patients?
[A] An important feature of the mental state in hysteria is the instability and variability of all the mental faculties , emotions , will, and intellectual processes . Most apparent is the excessive development of the emotional faculties , and the deficient exercise of the will . The subjects of hysteria give way readily to grief , or joy , and seem to have little power of controlling the flow of tears , or the outburst of laughter . They are self-conscious , and show a constant desire for the sympathy of those around them.

[U] "Once upon a time, in a quiet village, there lived two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, who were as close as the petals of a flower. Near their home, in the shadowy woods, strange goblin merchants appeared at dusk, calling out with their tempting songs and offering luscious, enchanted fruits. Though warned never to taste the goblins' wares, Laura, enchanted by their song, could not resist. She traded a lock of her golden hair for the forbidden fruit, which she ate with delight. But soon, Laura began to waste away, growing pale and weak. No matter how much she longed for the fruit again, she could no longer hear the goblins’ calls."

She told Laura to kiss her, and as Laura drank the juice from Lizzie’s face, the spell was broken. Laura was saved, her health and spirit restored, and the sisters lived on, cherishing their bond and sharing their story as a warning and a celebration of sisterly love.

[U] Describe Loreto.
[A] LORETO, an inland department of Peru, lying E. of the Andes Cordilleras and forming the N.E. part of the republic. Extensive territories, nominally parts of this department, are in dispute between Peru and the neighbouring republics of Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador, and the northern and eastern boundaries of the territory are therefore not definitely determined. Loreto is bounded W. by the departments of Amazonas and San Martin. The area of the department, including the territories claimed by Peru, is estimated at 257,798 sq. m. The population is estimated (1906) at 120,000. The aboriginal population is not numerous, as the thick, humid forests are inhabited only where lakes and streams make open spaces for sunlight and ventilation. The natural resources of this extensive region are incalculable, but their development has been well nigh impossible through lack of transport facilities.

Pop. (1880) 11,183, (1890) 50,395, (1900) 102,479, of whom 19,064 were foreign-born; the growth in population since 1900 has been very rapid and in 1906 it was 319,198. The city had in 1910 an area of 85.57 sq. m., of which more than one-half has been added since 1890. Los Angeles is served by the Southern Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fé, and the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake railways; by steamers to San Francisco; and by five systems of urban and suburban electric railways.

[A] LOUDUN is a town of western France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Vienne, on an eminence overlooking a fertile plain, 45 m. by rail S.W. of Tours. Pop. (1906) 3931. It was formerly surrounded by walls, of which a single gateway and two towers remain. Of the old castle of the counts of Anjou which was destroyed under Richelieu, the site now forming a public promenade, a fine rectangular donjon of the 12th century is preserved; at its base traces of Roman constructions have been found, with fragments of porphyry pavement, mosaics and mural paintings. The Carmelite convent was the scene of the trial of Urban Grandier, who was burnt alive for witchcraft in 1634; the old Romanesque church of Sainte Croix, of which he was curé, is now used as a market. The church of St Pierre-du-Marché, Gothic in style with a Renaissance portal, has a lofty stone spire. There are several curious old houses in the town.

It lies at the foot of the pagoda hill which rises about 300 ft. above the plain on the promontory of land round which the Nam Kan winds to the main river. It has a population of about 9000 and contains the "palace" of the king of the state and several pagodas. In 1887 it was taken and sacked by the band of Black Flags, robber bands of Chinese soldiery, many of them survivors of the Taiping rebellion. In 1893 Siam was compelled to renounce her claims to the left bank of the Me Kong, including Luang-Prabang and the magnificent highlands of Chieng Kwang. That portion of the state which was on the right bank of the Me Kong was not affected by the treaty, except in so far as a portion of it fell within the sixteen miles' zone within which Siam agreed not to keep troops. Trade is in the hands of Chinese or Shan traders; hill rice and other jungle products are imported from the surrounding districts by the Kha or hill people.

[U] Define marriage.
[A] Marriage may be defined either (a) as the act , ceremony , or process by which the legal relationship of husband and wife is constituted ; or (b) as a physical , legal and moral union between man and woman in complete community of life for the establishment of a family. It is possible to discriminate between three stages , taking mar- riage in the latter sense as an institution--the animal or physical stage , the proprietary or legal stage , and the personal or moral stage . In the first or physical stage the relation of the sexes was unregulated , and in many cases of brief duration . In the second or legal stage greater permanence was secured in marriage by assigning the husband a property right in his wife or wives . In the last stage the proprietary relation falls more and more into the background , and the relation of husband and wife approximates that of two individuals entirely equal before the law .

A lawyer who became a lobbyist for and director of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Kennedy also served several terms in the Maryland General Assembly and became its Speaker in 1847. Kennedy later helped lead the effort to end slavery in Maryland, which, as a non-Confederate state, was not affected by the Emancipation Proclamation and required a state law to free slaves within its borders and to outlaw the furtherance of the practice.

[U] What is a keyboard?
[A] A keyboard is a succession of keys for unlocking sound in stringed , wind or percussion musical instruments, together with the case or board on which they are arranged. The two principal types of keyboard instruments are the organ and the piano ; their keyboards , although similarly constructed , differ widely in Scope and capabilities . The keyboard of the organ , a purely mechanical contrivance , is the external means of communicating with the valves or pallets that open and close the entrances to the pipes . As its action is incapable of variation at the will of the performer , the keyboard of the organ remains without influence on the quality and intensity of the sound . The key- board of the piano , on the contrary , besides its purely mechanical function , also forms a sympathetic vehicle of transmission for the performer's rhythmical and emotional feeling , in consequence of the faithfulness with which it passes on the impulses communi- cated by the fingers .

[A] KIDNAPPING was originally the stealing and carrying away of children and others to serve as servants or labourers in the American plantations ; it was defined by Blackstone as the forcible abduction or stealing away of a man , a man , woman or child from their own country and sending them into another. The difference between kidnapping , abduction and false imprisonment is not very great ; indeed , kidnapping may be said to be a form of assault and false imprisonment , aggravated by the carrying of the person to some other place. The term is, however , more co more commonly applied in England to the offense of taking away children from the possession of their parents.

[U] What is Kilimanjaro?
[A] KILIMANJARO is a great mountain in East Africa, its centre lying in 3 ° 5 ′ S. and 37 ° 23 ′ E. It is the highest known summit of the continent , rising as a volcanic cone from a plateau of about 3000 ft . to 19,321 ft . Though completely isolated it is but one of several summits which crown the eastern edge of the great plateau of equatorial Africa. The major axis of Kilimanjaro runs almost east and west , and on it rise the two principal summits , Kibo in the west , Mawenzi (Ki-mawenzi) in the east . Kibo , the higher , is a truncated cone with a nearly perfect extinct crater , and marks a comparatively recent period of volcanic activity ; while Mawenzi ( 16,892 ft . ) is the very ancient core of a former summit, of which the crater walls have been removed by denudation . The two peaks , about 7m. apart , are connected by a saddle or plateau , about 14,000 ft . in altitude , below which the vast mass slopes with great regularity in a typical volcanic curve , especially in the south , to the plains below.

Sharply outlined against the horizon there lies before us, open and cloudless, the mighty mountain-tract of Kilimanjaro. At its feet there are already gathering single small clouds, then clouds in thicker masses ; soon a sea of vapour will hide it from our sight. Beside it we see the Mawenzi -- a dark, threatening, desolate dome of rocks. As we move forward over the scattered blocks of lava, we are reminded that this rocky region was once the scene of some tremendous volcano's display of power -- a primeval convulsion to whose forces, according to Hans Mever, is to be attributed the foundation in course of time of the "Great Rift Valley," the choked-up tract over which we are now ranging.

[U] How did Guglielmo Marconi invent the antenna?
[A] Marconi made the important discovery that if his sensitive tube or coherer had one terminal attached to a metal plate lying on the earth, or buried in it, and the other to an insulated plate elevated at a height above the ground, it could detect the presence of very feeble electric waves of a certain kind originating at a great distance. In conjunction with the above receiver he employed a transmitter, which consisted of a large induction or spark coil S having its spark balls placed a few millimetres apart; one of these balls was connected to an earth plate E and the other to a plate or wire insulated at the upper end and elevated above the surface of the earth. In the primary circuit of the induction coil I he placed an ordinary signalling key K, and when this was pressed for a longer or shorter time a torrent of electric sparks passed between the balls, alternately charging and discharging the elevated conductor A and creating electrical oscillations in the wire. This elevated conductor is now called the antenna, aerial wire, or air wire.

[U] What is telepathy?
[A] TELEPATHY, or thought transference, is the conveyance of thoughts and feelings from mind to mind by other than the ordinary channels of sense. Although the word "telepathy" was first suggested by F.W.H. Myers in 1882 , the suggestion had long before been made that the transmission of ideas , images and sensations could be brought about by other than the normally operative motor and sensory apparatus of the body . More than one writer had explained wraiths at the moment of death , clairvoyance and the phenomena of spiritualism by the theory of "brain waves." But it was not until the advent of the Society for Psychical Research that the hypothesis attracted much notice or was backed by carefully collected evidence. As used by the society the term is a mere designation, and implies no hypothesis as to "action at a distance" or the operation of any force not recognized by physical science.

[U] What is the Temperance Movement?
[A] The word "temperance," which strictly means moderation, has acquired a particular meaning in connexion with intoxicating liquor, and it is here used in that limited sense. The "temperance question" is the equivalent in English of l'alcoolisme and Alkoholismus in French and German-speaking countries respectively; it embraces all the problems that arise in connexion with the use or abuse of alcoholic drink. This usage has arisen from the practice of societies formed for the purpose of suppressing or reducing the consumption of such liquors, and calling themselves Temperance Societies. Their activity is often spoken of as the Temperance Movement, though that term properly covers very much wider ground.
