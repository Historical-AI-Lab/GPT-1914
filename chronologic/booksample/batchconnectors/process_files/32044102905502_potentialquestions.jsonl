It's for a book \"Annals of Mathematics\", a novel published in 0 (probably 2000?). The passage is mathematical in style. The masked sentence: \"[masked sentence revising an implied expectation]\". We need to write a sentence appropriate for this book that could stand in that position. So we need a sentence that fits context: \"If we write y1(t), and t = 1(x), and give x and y arbitrarily selected values, y1 and x1 respectively, the roots of y1 = 1(t), t = (t1, t2, tз, ...) are in general all distinct from the values of t = 1(x1), t = (t₁', ta', ts', . ). [masked sentence revising an implied expectation] In particular the weight of the point (x1, y1) will be the sum of the weights given by the points, ti\", ta\", ta\",, or in other words it will be aß.\"\n\nWe need to produce a sentence that revises an implied expectation. So maybe something like: \"However, contrary to the naive assumption that these roots would coincide, they generally do not.\" Or \"Nevertheless, the anticipated alignment between the two sets of roots fails in most cases.\" Must be 58 words? Wait: The answer should be a short passage about 58 words, 1-3 sentences. So the entire answer should be ~58 words. The sentence we produce should be the masked sentence. But the answer must contain the entire passage? The question: \"Write a sentence appropriate for this book that could stand in the position marked by [masked sentence revising an implied expectation]:\" Then: \"Write only the answer, without quotation marks:\" So we need to provide the sentence. But the requirement earlier: \"Answer the following question with a short passage (about 58 words, 1-3 sentences)\". So maybe the answer should be a short passage 58 words, 1-3 sentences. But then they ask to write a sentence appropriate for this book that could stand in the position marked by [masked sentence revising an implied expectation]. So we need to produce a sentence that could go there. The entire answer should be that sentence, presumably 58 words? Wait: The passage is 58 words, 1-3 sentences. But the masked sentence might be part of that passage. But they want only the sentence that could stand in that position. So the answer should be that sentence only, not the whole passage. But the earlier instruction says answer with a short passage about 58 words, 1-3 sentences. Contradiction. Let's interpret: They want the answer to be a short passage of about 58 words, 1-3 sentences. That passage should include the sentence that goes in the masked position. So maybe the passage is the entire excerpt with the masked sentence replaced. But the instruction says \"Write a sentence appropriate for this book that could stand in the position marked by [masked sentence revising an implied expectation]:\" So maybe they only want the sentence. But the first instruction says \"Answer the following question with a short passage (about 58 words, 1-3 sentences):\" So maybe the answer should be the entire passage of about 58 words. But the passage is given partially, with the masked sentence. So we need to fill that. So we need to produce the whole passage, 58 words, 1-3 sentences, replacing the masked sentence with our sentence. So we need to count words. Let's craft a passage of maybe 2 sentences, total 58 words. The passage includes the given text, but we need to incorporate our new sentence. Let's count words.\n\nOriginal text before masked sentence:\n\n\"If we write y 1(t), and t = 1(x), and give x and y arbitrarily selected values, y1 and x1 respectively, the roots of y1 = 1(t), t = (t1, t2, tз, ...) are in general all distinct from the values of t = 1(x1), t = (t₁', ta', ts', . ).\"\n\nLet's count words:\n\n\"If(1) we2 write3 y1(t),4 and5 t6 =7 1(x),8 and9 give10 x11 and12 y13 arbitrarily14 selected15 values,16 y117 and18 x119 respectively,20 the21 roots22 of23 y1=24 1(t),25 t26 =27 (t1,28 t2,29 tз,30 ...)31 are32 in33 general34 all35 distinct36 from37 the38 values39 of40 t41 =42 1(x1),43 t44 =45 (t₁',46 ta',47 ts',48 .49 ).\"\n\nSo 49 words before masked sentence.\n\nNow we need to add a sentence of maybe 9 words to reach 58. So 49 + 9 = 58. So we need a 9-word sentence that revises an implied expectation.\n\nWe need 9 words. Example: \"Yet these roots rarely coincide with the anticipated ones.\" Count words: Yet1 these2 roots3 rarely4 coincide5 with6 the7 anticipated8 ones9. That's 9 words. Good.\n\nNow we need to include the rest of the passage after masked sentence: \"In particular the weight of the point (x1, y1) will be the sum of the weights given by the points, ti\", ta\", ta\",, or in other words it will be aß.\"\n\nLet's count words after masked sentence:\n\n\"In1 particular2 the3 weight4 of5 the6 point7 (x1,8 y1)9 will10."], "answer_probabilities": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "passage": "If we write y 1(t), and t = 1(x), and give x and y arbitrarily selected values, y₁ and x1 respectively, the roots of y₁ = 1(t), t = (t1, t2, tз, ...) are in general all distinct from the values of t = 1(x1), t = (t₁', ta', ts', . ).
