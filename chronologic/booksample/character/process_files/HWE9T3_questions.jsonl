Sister Katherine Bayssallance was no nun, except that she was still, at fortyfive or fifty, in a state of celibacy. One thinks of a nun, despite the horrid stories sometimes told of convents, as of a woman saintly in appearance as well as by profession-she should be pale, austere, and thin; Sister \n\nKatherine, on the other hand, was plump of figure and rosy cheeked, fonder of mirth than of tears, and of a cheerful piety. In all respects she was the exact opposite of the nun as we are apt to think of her. She was also voluble exceedingly. Yet not foolish like most voluble persons who, so long as they can\nstill be talking, care not greatly what they say or who listens. In every respect she was unlike her brother, the Lieutenant, who lived with her. For while she was easy, he was stiff; while she was plump, he was thin; while she was merry, he was grave; while she was voluble, he was sparing of his words. But such opposites are common in families. George, for his part, took after his father's sister rather than his father. The good lady, espying me one day- 'twas on a Sunday, after dinner-wandering in melancholy mood about the place-there was little joy at home during those daysopened her window and hemmed, and bade me come in. 'I am alone,' she said, when I obeyed. Come in and let us have a comfortable crythat is, I will cry. I am alone. The Lieutenant has gone to the Crown and Anchor for his pipe and his glass. George-poor lad!has taken sculls across the river, and is now, I take it, sitting glum, all alone, in the Dock; and even that brings him no comfort, though he ought to think that it is worth—ay !—a\ngood six hundred pounds a-year. Think upon that! Six hundred pounds a-year for him, who was yesterday but a mate of an East Indiaman. And yet no happiness to go with it! What is fortune without happiness? His case is like a text for a sermon. Yesterday but a poor unconsidered swab of a third mate, whom nobody regarded; and to-day the rich and prosperous Owner of a Dock! 'Tis a change such as one may dream and fortune-tellers prophecy. He could wish for nothing better, and yet with it comes also this great misfortune. Poor boy! my heart bleeds for him. You will take a glass of my ginger, Nevill: you were always fond of a glass of good wine. The pity of it! The pity of it!' The pity of it!' I repeated. 'Sit down, Nevill. This bottle of ginger wine of my own making-I offer my friends nothing less-longs to have the cork out. Wait a little. It is a twelvemonth oldginger takes a whole twelvemonth to mellow.' She bustled about, and presently set on the table the bottle, a couple of glasses, and a plate of dried Smyrna figs. There, Nevill- 6\nand I only wish that Sylvia was here too. The good wine-it is heady for a girl's drinking-would cheer her heart and loosen her tongue, and help her to tell us what she now conceals. Drink it, my dear. To Sylvia's better health and George's better luck!' I drank the toast, sipping the wine slowly. One must not gulp ginger wine, or it will burn the throat and bring the tears into the eyes. Taken in sips, it is an excellent stomachic. 'Your mother's raisin is good, I admit, and in cowslip she has no equal,' said Sister Katherine, but think of this for ginger! And yet men must be yearning after port, and sighing because the war will keep claret off their tables!' The Sisters' houses are not so commodious as those of the Brothers, nor are they placed round a court or quadrangle. Yet they are comfortable, the rooms wainscotted, and the stairs ample. Sister Katherine's parlour was large enough for her purposes, but low, as happens with ancient houses. The windows."}

On this night the trees were white with spring blossoms, and the air was fragrant with their delicate breath. It is in a garden--a garden of fruit-trees, as well as of vegetables and flowers-that we may most profitably meditate on the course of life and its meaning. This has been often set forth by wise men. Here, in spring, we see the earth awakening from its sleep, which is the type of death. A new year-a new life is begun. Thus life ever follows death, and\nafter death life begins anew. It is as if there were but one man, and he every night lying down and every morning again uprising. He does his work-between the morning and the evening and he dies. Then a new manwho is the same-is born again, with conditions of life all the better if the last man has done his work well. He, too, in his turn advances the work a little. And so on; now falling back a little, now advancing a little, until in time to come man shall be so strong, so long-lived, that he will look back with wonder even upon the polite age of George the Third, and ask himself how, being exposed to so many perils, he could ever have been happy even for one single moment. Can\n\nHeaven itself, by the Divine assistance, thus be reached? To this spot we were wont to repair by long use and custom. Naturally our feet turned towards the garden and the orchard. Here as children we could play, being both of an age, and here, when we grew older, we could walk and talk. It is one of those places in which, however great may be the noise\nST. KATHerine's BY THE TOWER \n\noutside, it seems always quiet. The lanes and narrow alleys of the Precinct were full of people who sang and laughed, quarrelled and reviled each other, shouted and fought, and made all the noises that delight a rude folk. Yet the noise came not into any part of the Hospital. From the river there still arose from some belated ship a yo-hoing and bawling, but we seemed to hear nothing—not even the firing of the ordnance from the \n\nTower or the salutes of the ships which arrived at Deptford Yard or sailed away. We walked there hand-in-hand without speech, but each knew very well what was in the heart of the other. Presently Sylvia stopped at the little door which opened upon the burying-ground. 'Let us leave the garden,' she said. 'Let us go into the burying-ground-here is spring, and that means love and hope. I have nothing more to do with spring. There are graves-and they mean dust and death.' She lifted the latch and we stepped out into the crowded graveyard behind the\nchurch. Here the stones, standing thick together, grey by day, were now silvery white in the moonlight or black in shadow. The grass grows long in summer, but it was now still short, and underfoot it was soft and damp. Among the graves Sylvia told me for the first time the truth of what had happened to her. Sylvia sat down on one of the tombs and threw back her hood. The evening breeze played in her light brown curls, and the moon made her blue eyes shine large and ghostly. It might have been a ghost among the graves. I believe it is not lucky to sit on a grave, but nobody, surely, could be more unlucky than my sister at that period. Brother,' she said, holding my hand, 'I am, indeed, the most miserable creature in the whole world.' 6 'It will pass, my dear. Everybody is agreed that it will go away. You will awake some morning and find yourself in your right mind.' 'Never-my mind is not disordered. I\nknow very well what I am saying, and what has befallen me.'"}

A pure democracy? I watch and wait. The people will have leaders. Talk what you please of equal governments: that of the people will be a government by their leaders and their idols of the moment.

Lead, unless you wish to be driven. Under the most equal form of government, unless you wish to be governed, be yourself the King.' With such language did the Marquis lead me on. How I came to join at last the club where you have already seen me matters not; it was then a necessary step in the progress of a Revolutionary that he should join a club. What was my astonishment when, after I had taken the oath of secrecy and had my eyes unbound, I saw seated at the table with the company none other than the old Marquis\nhimself, the victim and natural enemy of \n\nRevolution, and our schoolmaster and organist, Richard Archer!

Man alive! there will be such things in London as these rich and greasy citizens have never so much as imagined, when Wapping and Shadwell and the Precinct pour their armies of emancipated slaves into Threadneedle \n\nStreet and Cheapside.' 'It is pleasing,' said the Marquis, with great sweetness, ' to sit in the company of this \n\nSublime Society of Snugs, of whom I am one -I have become a Snug'-he looked round here with a smile- and to hear from their\nlips the doctrines which were formerly the secret possession of nobles and philosophers. There has been a general diffusion of principles: the world has become a creature who reasons. I recognise my masters, and watch them with interest. In Paris I was compelled to fly from them. This ardent youth '—he laid his hand upon Archer's shoulder-pants to become a Danton, or a Marat, or a Robespierre. Perhaps he will: it is quite possible. When you sit in the church to-morrow, Nevill, you will hear behind the hymn-tune the air of \"Ça ira.\" If you pass the school, you may fancy that the master is teaching the innocent children the Rights of Man.' You, yourself, my young friend, will never be a\n\nMarat. You may, however, aspire to become a Bailly or a Lafayette. Here, you see, I watch and study my masters.' 66 The societies which then grew up like mushrooms in every town, whether they called themselves the Friends of the People, or the Corresponding Society, or the Constitutional Society, or the Association for \n\nDisseminating Political Knowledge, or any-\nthing else, were neither more nor less than Revolutionary Societies. The addresses which were ordered and circulated everywhere by these societies, though they claimed no more than a reformed Parliament, were revolutionary, because the authors of the address knew well from the history of the National Assembly what would follow such a Reform.

'Selfishness,' said my friends, 'with the rich is more powerful than the sense of justice.' It certainly is; yet we made the greatest of all mistakes when we fondly imagined that those virtues which are feeble, even altogether lacking, in men of substance, education, and urbanity, must necessarily be conspicuous in those of ignorance, rudeness, and poverty. While I was thus drifting, as it were, along a current leading me into the perilous waters of conspiracy, an accident occurred which greatly accelerated my progress. Among the thousands of émigrés and exiles who crowded over during the first year was one named the\nMarquis de Rosnay, who came-why, I know not to live in the Precinct. He was very poor, but his pride equalled his poverty. He was old-past seventy years of age he had lived in England many years before the Revolution. I believe he had even been Ambassador at the Court of St. James's; he spoke \n\nEnglish clearly, if not fluently. As for his old friends, of whom he must have had many, for he spoke familiarly of the Court of George the Second, and of the great men of that time, he would not seek out any. He lived in this remote and obscure part of London in order to be concealed from their pity or their charity. One room in a small house belonging to the \n\nHospital-'twas in St. Katherine's Squaresufficed for him, and on what private resources he lived I cannot say. He was a beautiful old gentleman to look at, not tall, but upright still, not as yet bowed by his weight of years. He looked always as if he had that moment left the hands of his valet and his perruquier; his linen and his lace was of the whitest; his coat and waistcoat the most spotless; his face always calm, noble,\nand dignified. One could never at any time, and whatever the conversation, observe in him the least impatience or anger at the reverse of fortune which had transferred him from a great palace in the country to a little house in St. Katherine's. He preserved the grand manner in this retreat, and conversed with me as if he were still the Ambassador and I a young gentleman in whom he took a kindly interest. Yet, although his appearance and bearing were such that no one could presume upon the least liberty, his voice and his speech were as gentle and as sweet as those of any girl. He found me out; he made me talk to him; he drew me on gently, little by little, until I spoke freely of myself, my reading, and my opinions; he received my confidences with patience-never could I speak to any one freely as to the Marquis; he encouraged me. To this day I have never been able to learn what opinions he really held. Once he said to me: Young man, it is fifty years and more since I first heard discussions on these 6\n£ \n\nsubjects which now interest you-and the whole world—so deeply. I have sat at tables where Voltaire, Diderot, D'Alembert, even your Bolingbroke, freely discussed the sovereignty of the people. I have lived to see these ideas put in practice across the ocean. I have expected, a long time, to see it prevail in France, where there is more respect paid to reason and the art of logic than-perhaps -in Great Britain. It is interesting to have seen the ideas of one's youth actually carried out by my own people. If I was not so old that instruction comes too late it would be useful for me to observe the things which naturally follow when the people have assumed the sovereignty. As a natural result, I am here, and my estates-where are they?' He shrugged his shoulders and took a pinch of snuff."}

This, you will perceive,\nthrows a very different complexion upon the business. Most unfortunately, this confession or revelation was made to me the evening before the most disastrous day in my whole life, when I was deprived of all power to control what followed, even though my knowledge of what had happened gave me such power. Had it not been for this disaster, I should have laid the whole business before the Prebendary in the first place. The schoolmaster would have been cited before the \n\nChapter House of the Foundation: the wise woman would have been made to confess what she knew: George would have been told the whole truth and we should have seen then what would have happened next. I take it as unwise of me-though, Heaven knows, I acted for the best-to have delayed speaking to my sister for so long. I suffered a fortnight and more to pass by, hoping every day to see a change for the better. Finally, when there came no change, I resolved to appeal to her sisterly affection, and to pray her to tell me all that was in her mind. It was an evening late in the month of April M 2\nwhen I found my opportunity. The evening was soft and calm, the air was warm, though the season was as yet but little advanced. There was a gentle breeze from the west, the sky was clear. Sylvia had been sitting all day long in her chair, inanimate and pallid; there I found her, and proposed to her that she should come out with me to breathe for a little the freshness of the evening. Always docile, she rose and consented to go with me. So I wrapped her in her hood and led her forth, walking slowly, because she was now feeble. Outside she breathed with pleasure the fresh and fragrant air of the garden. Alas!' she sighed,' what things have fallen upon me since last I stood here!' The moon was already up, and now shone in great splendour upon the east end of the church, lighting up the broad and lofty window, and showing the tracery of the great \n\nCatherine wheel, emblem of the saint and martyr, patron of this place, which stands in the upper part. The narrow windows below glowed like burnished silver; the two towers\nof the north and south angles stood out against the clear sky in distinct outline; the whole north side of the church was in blackness. The Gothic pile, venerable always, but especially in the moonlight, filled the soul with admiration and awe; it has been a holy place from the days of King Stephen to our own time. For six hundred years and more the living have flocked hither for worship, and have brought their dead for burial; here \n\nQueens have knelt to offer gifts, and Princes have been buried. What matter for Queens and Princes? All the dead of six hundred years lie around and within this sacred pile. Save the Cathedral churches of St. Peter's and\n\nSt. Paul's, there is no more venerable or sacred spot than the ancient and beautiful church of \n\nSt. Katherine's by the Tower. We were standing in the Master's orchard, beside the Master's house, and behind the burying-ground of the Precinct. 'Tis a pleasant place in summer, and at all times when one can walk abroad and enjoy the warmth of the sun in a fenced garden sheltered from the wind. There are old fruit-trees in the\norchard-everything is old-apples and pears, cherries and medlars, and mulberries; peaches and vines are trained against the high wall at the back, which has a southern aspect-it is said that before the Reformation the Brothers made wine from their own grapes; there is a bowling green on that side nearest the house. Here from the time of \n\nKing Stephen downwards has that ancient game been played."}
