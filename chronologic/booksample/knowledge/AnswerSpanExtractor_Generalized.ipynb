They are of fleshy substance, with calcareous granules imbedded, and in a living state the blades are continually opening and closing. They were at one time supposed to be parasitic zoophytes, but are now generally believed to be organs of the star-fish or sea-urchin, though their use is merely conjectured to be that of keeping the surface of the echinoderm free of algae and zoophytes. The introduction of a pin's point between the blades causes an immediate closing of them. They are found both on shelly and on comparatively soft integuments, and are always present, and always of a particular form, according to the species of echinoderm, and according to the particular place which they occupy, being crowded chiefly around the spines, and near the mouth of sea-urchins. Lousewort (Pedicularis palustris): a, corolla cut open, showing the stamens; b, fruit, c, pistil.

      "PEDIFORM-PEDIGREE. and P. sylvatica, natives of Britain, common in wet grounds, have received the name of Lousewort, English equivalent of pedicularis,' from their supposed influence in producing the lousy disease in sheep; an influence purely imaginary. Their acridity renders them injurious to sheep which eat them. Continental Europe and Asia produce many other species, and some are found in N. America. P. sceptrum, or King Charles's Sceptre, is a principal ornament of marshy grounds in the most northern countries of Europe. PEDIFORM, a. pèd'i-fawrm [L. pědem a foot; forma, shape] shaped like a foot. PEDIGEROUS, a. pě-dij'ér-ŭs [L. pědem, a foot; gero, I carry or bear] having feet; furnished with footlike organs. PEDIGREE, n. pěd'i-grè [OE. pedigru and petegreu, also pe-de-gre, a line of kindred; prob. from L. pes or pedem, foot]: list or register containing the line of ancestors from which a person or family is descended; genealogy; lineage; the same list made more full, and often representing, in tabular form, the relations in which the members of a family stand to each other, accompanied or unaccompanied by a notice of the chief events in the life of each, with their dates, and the evidence of the facts stated. Note.-Wedgwood gives F. pied in the sense of tree, so that pied-de-gres would thus signify a tree of degrees. Skeat's derivation from F. pied-de-grue, crane's foot, the heraldic tree being generally crooked, seems improbable.-Pedigrees are indispensable aids to the student of history. The wars of the Roses, the claim of Edward III. to the crown of France, the relative position of Mary and Lady Jane Grey, the circumstances which brought about the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the Slesvig-Holstein question, which occupied the attention of all Europe, and many other familiar chapters in the history of nations, as well as of families, cannot be read aright without the aid of pedigrees. The materials for formation of a P. are notes of the facts to be set forth, and a recognized series of signs and abbreviations. These notes comprise the name of every person who is to appear in the P., with dates and circumstances desirable for record. Among the commonest abbreviations are dau., for daughter of; 8. and h., son and heir of; col., coheir of; w., wife of; sp. (sine prole), without issue; v. p. (vitâ patris), in his father's lifetime; b., born; d., died; dep., deposed; K., king; E, earl, etc. The sign placed between two names, indicates that they were husband and wife; a downward-pointing arrow under a name signifies that the person had children. All persons of the same generation are to be kept in the same horizontal line; and the main line of descent is, wherever possible, to be indicated by keeping the successive names in a vertical column. Continuous lines indicate the succession of the different generations. The members of the same family in one generation are arranged usually in their order of birth in two groups-sons first, then daugh- PEDILUVIUM. ters; but where the same father or mother has children by more than one marriage, the children of each marriage ought to form distinct groups. The actual arrangement, however, of a P. must always depend on the leading object which it is intended to illustrate. Tabular genealogies, generally brief, and meant to illustrate some particular claim of right, are found among the records, public and private, of the early middle ages; but after the incorporation of the English Heralds' College, far more attention was given to the compilation of pedigrees of families, with reference particularly to their claims to dignities and heraldic insignia. In the 16th c., the heralds obtained copies of all such accounts of the English families of any distinction as could be supplied to them, and entered them in the books which contain their official records. Royal commissions were issued under the Great Seal to the two provincial kings-of-arms, empowering them to visit in turn the several counties of England, in order to collect from the principal persons of each county an account of the changes in their respective families in the interval since the last preceding visitation, and to inquire what account could be given of themselves by families who had stepped into the rank of gentry, or had become settled in the county since that period. The register-books kept by the heralds and their assistants contain the pedigrees and arms collected in the course of the visitations, with the signatures of the heads of the families. The pedigrees thus collected contain a vast body of information, interesting not only to the professed genealogist, but to every one who would know anything of the distinguished characters in English history. Some of these books are lost, the rest are scattered among the public and private libraries of the country, the largest collections being in the archives of the College of Arms and the British Museum. After the beginning of the 18th c., the visitations were discontinued, and there has since been no official and regalar collection of pedigrees. Persons frequently record their pedigrees for preservation in the Register of the College of Arms. This register is quite distinct from the heraldic department of that institution, and is open to any one who wishes to preserve evidence of any properly authenticated facts regarding his descent and family. PEDIGREE, in law, is the legal relationship between individuals which is looked to with regard to the descent of property and honors. See INTESTACY: NEXT OF KIN: SUCCESSION. PEDILUVIUM, n. pěd'ž-lô'vì-ŭm [L. pès or pědem, a foot; luo, I wash]: a foot-bath; the bathing of the feet. PEDIMENT-PEDOTROPHY. PEDIMENT, n. pěd'i-měnt [unascertained: Skeat sug gests a supposed L. pedamentum, a stake or prop-from pedire, to furnish with feet, to prop]: space filled with stone over the portico at the ends of the roof of classic buildings. It is inclosed below by the horizontal cornice and above by the raking cornice, the latter following the slopes of the roof. The P. may be called the gable of classic buildings. It is frequently enriched with sculpture, for which it forms a fine setting. The doors and windows of classic buildings are often surmounted by pediments, either straight-sided or curved. The term may denote also the finishing stone of the front elevation of a building; similar crowning ornament of a piece of furniture, etc. PEDIPALPOUS, a. pěd'r-păl'pus [L. pēs or pědem, a foot; palpo, I feel; palpi, feelers]: applied to certain arachnida having feelers in the form of pincers, or armed with two claws, as the scorpions-the order is called PED'IPALPS, -pälps, or PED'IPAL'PI, n. plu. -păl'pī. PEDLAR, or PEDLER, n. pěd'lėr: see PEDDLE and PEDLER. PEDO-, prefix pē-dō- [Gr. pais, gen. paidos, a boy, a child]: relating to or connected with children. PEDOBAPTISM, n. pe'dō-baptizm [Gr. pais or paida, a child; baptismos, baptism]: the baptism of infants or of children. PE'DOBAP'TIST, n. -băp'tist, one who holds the Scriptural character of infant baptism: see BAPTISM, INFANT. PEDOMANCY, n. pèd'õ-mănʼsi [L. pēs or pědem, a foot: Gr. manteia, divination]: divination from the examination of the lines of the soles of the feet. PEDOMETER, n. pě-dom'ě-tër [L. pès or pědem, a foot; Gr. metron, a measure]: instrument worn in the pocket, by which the distance passed over in a given time by a pedestrian is ascertained: it sometimes has a watch or clock attached; and it is in the form of a watch with a dial-plate marked for miles and fractions of miles. Each step, causing by its movement the fall of a hanging weight, registers itself by the movement of the hands on the dial. The weight, forced back by a delicate spring to a horizontal position, is released by each step. After a measured mile or other known distance has been walked, and the resulting indication on the dial observed, the instrument can be set accordingly to correspond with the average pace. The P. gives an approximate measurement, but cannot be depended on for accuracy. See ODOMETER. PED'OMETRICAL, a. -ri-kǎl, pertaining to or determined by a pedometer. PEDONOSOLOGY, n. pē-dō-nă-sŏl'o-ji [prefix pedo-, Gr. nosos, disease; logos, discourse]: study of the diseases of children or infants. PEDOTROPHY, n. pè-dšťro-fi, or PEDOTROPHIA, n. pe-do-trofi-a [Gr. pais, paidos, a child; trepho, I rear]: that branch of hygiene which deals with the nourishment of infants and children.\n",

      "PEDRO I-PEDRO II. PEDRO I., King of Castile and Leon: see PETER THE CRUEL. PEDRO, pedro or pa'dro, I. (Dom PEDRO DE ALCAN- TARA), Emperor of Brazil: 1798, Oct. 12-1834, Sep. 24 (reigned 1822-31); b. Lisbon, Portugal; second son of John VI., King of Portugal. On the death of his elder brother 1801, he became Prince of Beja, and heir to the throne; and after his father's accession to the throne of Portugal and Brazil 1816, he received the title Prince of Brazil. He was carried with the royal family of Portugal in their flight to Brazil 1807, and from that time remained in that country. In 1817 he married Archduchess Leopoldine of Austria, and on his father's return to Lisbon, 1821, was named regent of Brazil. The Brazilians had become greatly disgusted with the illiberal methods of Portuguese rule. P., though arbitrarily ordered to return at once to Portugal for completion of his education, cast in his lot with the Brazilians, despite threats of exclusion from the throne of Portugal, and was chosen emperor of Brazil. His government was vigorous, but a war which broke out between his supporters and the advocates of republicanism distracted the country. In 1826 he succeeded to the throne of Portugal; and the Brazilian discontent was renewed in the prospect that Brazil would be again reduced to a dependent state. P.'s hasty temper led him to measures which increased the discontent. But he retained the dignity of king of Portugal only long enough to show his right to it, and, after granting a more liberal constitution, immediately resigned in favor of his daughter Maria II. The disturbances in Brazil still increased, the finances fell into disorder, the emperor's second marriage with Princess Amelia of Leuchtenburg displeased his subjects, and, after various ineffectual attempts to restore tranquillity, he was compelled, by the revolution of 1831, July, to resign the throne in favor of his son Pedro II. (q.v.), a boy 51 years old. P. then sailed for Portugal, where his brother Miguel had usurped the throne; and with the aid of an army swelled by French and English vol. unte rs, after a three years' campaign, he drove away the usurper, and restored his daughter to the throne. ceaseless excitement and struggle had produced exhaustion, which ended in his death. See BRAZIL: MIG UEL, Dom: PEDRO II. (Dom PEDRO DE ALCANTARA). PORTUGAL. But PEDRO II. (Dom PEDRO DE ALCANTARA), ex-Em peror of Brazil: born Rio Janeiro, 1825, Dec. 2 (reigned 1841-89); died 1891, Dec. 5; son of Pedro I. On his father's abdication, he became sovereign under the regency of Andrada, democratic leader; two years later, under a council of regency; at the age of 16 was crowned emperor; at 18 married Princess Theresa, dau. of Francis I., King of the Sicilies. The Amazon river was made free to all nations 1867. Journeys were made by P. to Europe 1871-2, to the United States, Europe, Pal- PEDUNCLE-PEEBLESSHIRE. estine, and Egypt 1876-7, and to Europe for his health 1887-8. The sale of slaves was prohibited by decree 1850; a bill for immediate abolition was enacted 1888, May 13, emancipating 600,000 to 700,000 slaves. An attempt on Dom Pedro's life was made 1889, by a Portuguese. 1889, Nov. 15, while at Petropolis, he was in formed of the revolution at Rio Janeiro. Returning thither, to his besieged palace, he was notified by the military leader, Gen. da Fonseca, of the decision that he must leave the country; and he accepted the banishment, but, with his family, was hurried on board ship at night by the revolutionists, arriving at Portugal Dec. 7. He remained in Europe, in failing health,dying two years later. A republic was proclaimed in Brazil. The revolution is attributed in part to disaffection of former slaveholders, but more to that of the army, in view of the apprehended substitution of a national guard-the army conspiring with the republican leagues that opposed the centralizing policy of the empire. There were provincial legislatures, but the emperor could veto their acts, had the appointment of governors, judges, and magistrates, and could fill every fourth senatorial vacancy. The council of state had life-tenure, and was made up from the relatives or partizans of the emperor. The heirapparent, Princess Isabel, and her husband, Count d'Eu (Prince Louis Philippe d'Orleans), were very unpopular. The ex-emp. was a man of noble presence and character, highly cultivated, interested especially in science, and always promoted internal improvements and the education and welfare of all classes in his empire. His wife and two daughters were reported as personally charming, and, like himself, gracious and unaffected, except that Isabel (princess regent during the absence of her father 1887-8) was said to have been imperious in her administration, and her husband was especially disliked by the people. PEDUNCLE, n. pě-dăng kẻ [mid. L. pedunculus, a little foot, a foot-stalk-from pès or pedem, a foot: F. pédoncule, a peduncle]: stem or stalk which supports one flower or fruit, or several (see FLOWER): stems by which shells are attached to other objects. PEDUN'CULAR, 8. -kü-ler, pert. to a peduncle, or growing from one. PE- DUN'CULATE, a. -kü-lāt, or PEDUN'CULATED, a. -lā-těd, having a peduncle; growing on a peduncle. PEE BLES: see PEEBLESSHIRE.

P. is bounded by Dumfries and Selkirk shires on the s., Lanarkshire on the w., Mid-Lothian on the n., and Selkirkshire on the e.; 356 sq. m., or 227,869 statute acres. Its lowest point above sea-level is about 450 ft., from which to 1200 ft. is the region of cultivation; but the county, being a group of hills, is mostly pastoral, with the arable lands chiefly in the valleys.

P. comprehends 16 parishes, with 14 parish churches. The only town is Peebles, the co. seat, an anc. royal burgh, 22 m. from Edinburgh, pleasantly situated on a peninsula, at the confluence of the Eddleston with the Tweed; pop. (1891) 5,621. William Chambers, 1859, made a free gift to this his native town of a suite of buildings, comprising a reading-room, public library of 15,000 vols., museum, gallery of art, and hall for lectures and concerts. In 1880-1, the valued rental of the county, town included (exclusive of railway property, £19,668), was £132,081. P. abounds in remains of British hill-forts, border towers, and other antiquities; and has numerous modern mansions.-See History of Peeblesshire, by W. Chambers (1 vol. 8vo, 1864), with maps and wood-engravings. Pop. (1891) 14,647. PEEKSKILL, pēks kil: village in Cortland tp., Westchester co., N. Y.; on the New York Central and Hudson River railroad, and the e. bank of the Hudson river; 43 m. above New York, 17 m. below Newburg. There is a steam-ferry across the river to Caldwell's Landing, and in summer a line of steamers runs to New York. The village occupies an elevated site, and the river scenery is said to be equal to that of the Rhine. There are several churches, one of which dates from 1767; good schools, and several institutions of higher learning; 3 weekly newspapers, a national bank (cap. $100,000), and a savings-bank. Water is supplied from a reservoir more than 350 ft. above the river. Iron-manufacturing is extensively carried on; and leather, fire-brick, and agricultural implements are made. P. was settled at an early period, was part of the Cortland manor, and was an important point in the revolution. A fire department was organized 1827. The village was incorporated 1839. Pop. (1870) 6,560; (1880) 6,893; (1890) 9,676.

They are square, with turrets at the angles, and the door is sometimes at a height from the ground. The lower story is usually vaulted, and formed a stable for horses, cattle, etc. For an account of these old towers, now mostly in ruin, see History of Peeblesshire, by W. Chambers, 1864. PEEL, pèl: small, populous, and thriving seaport town on the w. coast of the Isle of Man. It was formerly called 'Holm,' and was a place of importance in the island. The herring-fishery, the building of small vessels, and the manufacture of nets are carried on. The bay is spacious, and abounds with fish. At its n. extremity are several grotesque and romantic caverns. The s. extremity is formed by Peel Island, on which stand the grand old ruins of Peel Castle and St. German's Cathedral. The castle was formerly the frequent residence of the Earls of Derby, then Lords of the Isle of Man, and is expressly named in the original grant of Henry IV. to the Stanley family. Beneath the cathe dral is a strong subterranean dungeon, where many noble persons were in former days imprisoned, including Thomas, Earl of Warwick, in the time of Richard II., and Elinor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester, who was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in it 1440, and died within its gloomy recesses. In Sir Walter Scott's Peveril of the Peak, constant mention is made of this castle, and indeed it may be said to be the scene of the story. The ruins are yearly visited and admired by thousands of persons. Pop. (1871) 3,513; (1881) 4,360. PEEL, Sir ROBERT: British statesman: 1788, Feb. 5-1850, July 2; b. near Bury, in Lancashire; son of Sir Robert P. (created baronet 1800), wealthy cottonspinner, from whom he inherited a great fortune. P. was educated at Harrow, and at Christ-Church, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. 1808, taking a double firstclass; and entered the house of commons 1809 as member for Cashel, adopting the strong tory politics of his father. Percival was then prime minister. P. set quietly about the business-work of the house, feeling his way with that steady prudence and persevering diligence that were conspicuous in his character. In 1811 he was appointed under-sec. for the colonies; and 1812-18 he held the office of sec. for Ireland, showing a strong anti Rom.-Catholic spirit (whence the witty Irish gave him the nickname Orange-Peel'). This occasioned so ferocious an attack by O'Connell that even the cool and cautious secretary was driven to send the agitator a challenge. The police, however, prevented the duel. 1818-22 P. remained out of office, but not out of parliament, where he sat for the Univ. of Oxford. He now began to acquire reputation as financier and economist. form. He was still averse to religious or political re- No member of the Liverpool-Castlereagh cabinet PLATE 2.

He even vehemently defended the infamous 'Peterloo Massacre of 1819. In 1822 he re-entered the ministry as home sec.-Canning shortly afterward becoming foreign sec., on the suicide of Lord Castlereagh. The two worked well together for some time, as P. applied himself to financial matters, especially to the currency; but Roman Catholic emancipation' was a question on which Canning was considerably in advance of his brother-secretary, and when Canning was called by the king, after the resignation of Lord Liverpool, to form a sort of whig-tory ministry, P., with the Duke of Wellington and others, withdrew from office. Yet it is singularly characteristic of this most honest and compromising statesman that, even when he seceded (1827), his opinions were veering round to the liberal and generous view of the claims of Rom. Catholics; and when the death of Canning, shortly afterward, led to the formation of the Wellington-Peel govt., its great measureactually introduced by Orange-Peel' himself-was the ever-memorable one for the relief' of the Rom. Catholics (1829). As home sec., he signalized himself by reorganization of the London police force-since popularly called Peelers' and 'Bobbies,' their previous sobriquet being Charlies-from King Charles I., who (1640) extended and improved the police system. Meanwhile, the Univ. of Oxford had rejected its apostate representative. Then arose the great question of parliamentary reform, which P. firmly but temperately opposed. In 1830 the Wellington-Peel ministry fell, and was succeeded by a whig ministry under Earl Grey, which, 1832, carried the Reform Bill. P. (now Sir Robert P., by the death of his father), when he saw that reform was inevitable, accepted defeat and its results with equanimity. He shrank from factious opposition to the measure, and contented himself with presenting as forcibly as he could the political per-contra, seeking by keen and vigilant criticism to retard the too rapid strides of liberalism. He became leader of the 'conservative' opposition. In 1833, when the first 'reformed' parliament assembled, P. took his seat as member for Tamworth, which he represented till the close of his life. On the retirement of the Melbourne ministry, 1834, Nov., he accepted the office of prime minister, but could not give stability to his administration, and was compelled again to give place to Viscount Melbourne 1835, Apr., and resumed his place as leader of the opposition. P.'s conduct in opposition was always patriotic. The whigs, pressed on one side by the new radical party and the Anti-Corn-Law League, and on the other by O'Connell and the Irish repealers, gradually lost ground, and, being narrowly defeated 1841 on a motion of want of confidence, dissolved parliament. The general election that ensued was virtually a contest between Free Trade and Protection. Protection won; and when the new parliament met, a vote of no confi-\n",

      "PEEL. dence was carried by a majority of 91. The conservative party, headed by P., now came into office. The great feature of the new govt. was its attitude on the corn-law question. The whigs, while in office, and even after their expulsion, were bent on a fixed but moderate duty on foreign corn; the Anti-Corn-Law League would hear of nothing short of entire repeal; while Sir Robert was in favor of a modification of the sliding scale of duty which had existed since 1828. He introduced and carried (1842), in spite of strong opposition, a measure based on this principle. The deficit in the revenue, which had become quite alarming under the Melbourne administration, next engaged his atten tion, and led him to bring in a bill (1842) for the imposition of an income tax' of 7d. in the pound, to be levied for three years. To alleviate the new burden, P. com. menced a revision of the general tariff, and either abolished or lowered the duties on several very important articles of commerce, such as drugs, dyewoods, cattle, sheep, pigs, salted meat, butter, eggs, cheese, and lard. He also showed himself resolute in repression of the turbulent malcontents of Ireland. O'Connell (q.v.) was tried for conspiracy, and, though the judgment against him was set aside on appeal to the house of lords, the influence of the 'agitator' was broken. The first half of 1845 was marked by the allowance to Maynooth being increased and changed into a permanent endowment instead of an annual grant, and by the foundation of the Irish unsectarian colleges, and other important measures. But the potato-rot in Ireland during the autumn, followed by a frightful famine, rendered cheap corn' a necessity, if millions were not to starve. Cobden and the League redoubled their exertions. Lord John Russell announced the views of the whig party on the crisis, and Peel again yielded. He told his ministerial colleagues that the corn laws were doomed, and that their repeal was inevitable. Some of them refusing to go with him, he resigned; but, after a few days, was recalled, and resumed office. Lord Stanley, the late Lord Derby, seceded, and with Lord George Bentinck, Mr. Disraeli, etc., formed a no-surrender tory party; but the Duke of Wellington, Graham, Aberdeen, Gladstone, and other eminent conservatives, stood by Peel, and the measure for the repeal was carried. He was, however, immediately afterward defeated on an Irish Protection of Life Bill. Not so much on this account, as because he felt that the course which he had pursued had produced a dissolution of the old ties of party, and that he could not expect for some time to find himself at the head of a strong govt., P. retired from office 1846, June, giving place to a whig administration under Lord John Russell, to which he gave an independent but general support as the leader of a middle party rather whig than tory. In the critical times of 1847-8, he was one of the most important props of the govt., whose free-trade principles he had now completely accepted, PEEP-PEEPUL. His ecclesiastical policy also had undergone a remarkable change, and he now frankly supported the whigs in efforts to carry an act for repeal of Jewish disabilities. He was regarded by the working and middle classes generally with grateful respect. An unexpected catastrophe put an end to his career: 1850, June 28, he had spoken with great eloquence in the debate on Lord Palmerston's Greek policy; but on the following day was thrown from his horse in Hyde Park, and was so much injured that he died on the evening of July 2.-He left five sons, the eldest of whom, Sir ROBERT P., and the second, Sir FREDERICK P., have held office as ministers. -ARTHUR WELLESLEY P., the youngest son, graduated at Oxford 1852, was elected to parliament as a liberal, from Warwick, 1865, and became speaker of the house of commons 1884.

PEEP OF DAY, the first streaks of light in early morning piercing through the shades of night. Note.-Skeat prefers the derivation from OF. piper, to peep out, to pry; piper may be referred to the fowler who whistles or chirps like a bird in order to deceive-thus he pipes and peeps out at once; hence peep implies 'to look out slily,' so as not to be seen. PEEPUL, pe půl, or PIPUL, or PIPPUL, pip'ul (Ficus religiosa); known also as the SACRED FIG of India, and in Ceylon as the BO-TREE: species of Fig (q.v.), somewhat resembling the Banyan, but the branches not rooting like those of that tree, and the leaves heart-shaped, with long, attenuated points. The tree is held sacred by the Hindus, because Vishuu is said to have been born under it. It is held sacred by the Buddhists also. It attains great size and age. The juice contains caoutchouc, and is used by women as bandoline. Lac insects feed on this tree, and much lac is obtained from it. The fruit is not much larger than a grape, and, though eatable, is not valued. See Bo-TREE. PEER-PEEWIT. PEER, v. per [Norm. F. parer; OF. paroir, to appear -from L. parere, to peep out or appear, as the sun over a mountain: also Low Ger. piren, to look with half-shut eyes]: to come just in sight; to appear; to look narrowly; to peep. PEERING, imp. ADJ. prying. PEERED, pp. perd. Note.-PEER here has a double origin assigned to it, but the confusion resulting therefrom cannot now be unravelled; in the sense to come just in sight,' peer may be nothing more than an abbreviation of ' appear.' PEER, n. per [OF. per or peer; F. pair, a peer, a match-from L. par, equal]: a match; an equal; one of the same social rank; a nobleman; a member of the house of lords; general name applied to the titled nobility of Great Britain and Ireland, indicating their equality of rank. The peerage includes the various degrees of Baron, Viscount, Earl, Marquis, and Duke. The peers of England, of Great Britain, of the United Kingdom, and certain representative peers of Scotland and Ireland, together with certain of the bishops and archbishops, who are called lords spiritual, constitute the house of lords. The dignity of the peerage is hereditary, but in early times was territorial. Lifepeerages seem at one time to have been known in England; but in 1856 Sir James Parke, having been created by Queen Victoria Baron Wensleydale for and during the term of his natural life,' the house of lords, on the report of a committee of privileges, held that he was not entitled to sit and vote in parliament. Ladies may be peeresses in their own right either by creation or by inheritance: the wives of peers also are styled peeresses.

      "T, n. According to Naegele (Ueber das weibliche Becken), the extremity of the coccyx is in the female, when standing upright, about seven lines higher than the lower edge of the symphysis pubis; the upper edge of the symphysis being at the same level as the lower edge of the second segment of the coccyx. By attention to these data, a detached P. may readily be placed at the angle at which it normally lies in the skeleton. The shape of the human P. is much affected by the curving forward of the lower part of the sacrum. This bend of the sacrum forward serves to support the viscera, when the body is in erect posture; but it is of much more importance in its relation to the act of parturition. If all the anteroposterior diameters of the true P. from the brim to the outlet were bisected, the points of bisection would form a curved line, similar to the curve of the sacrum, and termed the axis of the P. As the head of the child has to follow this curve, the difficulties of parturition are much greater than if the axis of the P. had been straight, as in the other vertebrata. Without entering into unnecessary details, we may remark generally, that the fetal head is of oval shape, with its greatest diameter from before backward, and that in its passage through the P. it is so placed that its longest diameter at each stage of labor coincides with the longest diameter of the P. The head enters the P. with the occiput (or back of the skull) directed toward one ilium, and the face toward the other; at its final emergence, the face is turned toward the sacrum and coccyx. There can be no doubt that the screw-like or rotatory motion which is thus given to the fetal head, renders its passage through the P. more easy than it would otherwise have been.\n",
      "There are well-marked differences, chiefly having reference to the act of parturition, between the male and female P. In the female, the bones are lighter and more delicate than in the male, and the muscular impressions and eminences are less distinctly marked. The iliac fossæ are large and expanded; hence the great prominence of the hips. The several diameters (particularly the transverse diameter of the brim, which measures only 5.1 inches in the male) are somewhat greater; and the pubic arch is wider by about ten degrees; the sacrum also is wider and less curved.\n",

The acute form usually requires nothing but cooling medicines and diet, and mild local dressings, e. g., simple cerate, to protect the raw surfaces from exposure to the air. chronic form, a nutritious diet, with judicious use of tonics (iron, bark, etc.), is commonly successful.

These efforts were chiefly to fit small metal or even ruby points to the nib of the quill-pen; but the delicacy of fitting was so great, that but very little success attended the experiments. At the beginning of the 19th c. pens began to be made wholly of metal; they consisted of a barrel of very thin steel, and were cut and slit to resemble the quill-pén as closely as possible. They were inferior and expensive (retail price at first half a crown, abt. 62 cents); their chief fault was hardness, which produced disagreeable scratching of the paper. In 1820, Joseph Gillott made an improvement, removing this great defect, and developing the manufacture to a marvellous extent. This consisted in making three slits instead of the single one, gaining much greater softness and flexibility. Gillott also introduced machinery, so reducing the cost that he was enabled to sell his improved pens 1821 at £7 48. (about $35) per gross, then considered remarkably cheap.

      "In the manufacture of gold pens, the processes differ materially from those in the making of steel pens. Pure gold, or even 18-carat gold, is too soft; spring is lacking in it. The same is true of all gold below 12-carat. From 12 to 18 carat, the alloy has different degrees of temper which may be utilized for the work. The best metal for the purpose of pen-making is 16-carat gold, alloyed with silver and copper. It is the strongest, hardest, most elastic, and springy, and will give the longest 'life' to the pen, and the best satisfaction to the writer.\n",
      "In the manufacture, the gold is cast into ingots, which\n",
      "are rolled into strips and cut into pen-shape. The extreme points are carefully sawed away for the reception of the fridium, which forms the writing point. The iridium is an extremely hard metal, very bright and close-grained, resembling polished silver, but not so white. The particles for the point of the pen are fastened by melting the gold around them with a blow-pipe. The process is called 'sweating. The 'point' having been fixed, the remainder of the pen is hardened by a series of hammerings, which, when completed, leave the pen ready for the sawing or slitting process. This is accomplished by a thin, soft, copper saw, without teeth, covered with water and fine emery, and revolving very rapidly. The principle is the same as that on which stone and marble are sawn with sand: the fine emery, sticking in the soft copper, cuts the iridium, which is too hard to be sawn in any other way. The slit is completed by a tiny circular saw, cutting the slit to the previously made circular hole. The manufacture of iridium-pointed pens is very extensive in New York, where first the process is said to have been perfected. The subsequent processes are many and complex, but do not differ materially from those employed in the manufacture of steel pens.\n",
      "There is a popular notion that the best gold pens are pointed with diamonds. This is incorrect. A few of that kind were made many years ago; but they were very expensive, and the discovery of iridium put an end to their manufacture.

      "PENALTY: sum of money declared by some statute or contract to be payable by one who commits an offense or breach of contract. It is considered as a kind of punishment, and constituting indirectly a motive to the party to avoid the act which induces such a consequence. Many contracts between parties contain a clause that one or other of them who fails to perform his part of the contract will incur a P., i.e., will be liable to pay a fixed sum of money to the other party. In such cases, a distinction is drawn between a liquidated and unliquidated P.; and whether it is of the one kind or the other depends on the language in the contract. If it is a liquidated P., then, when the breach of contract is committed, the party in default must pay that precise sum, neither more nor less; but if it is unliquidated, then he is to pay, not the whole sum, but merely such part of it as corresponds to the injury or damage done, and of which proportion a jury is the sole judge in an action of damages. In statutes, when penalties are declared to follow on certain illegal acts, the sum is sometimes fixed, but in many cases only a maximum sum is stated, it being left to the court or the justices who enforce the P. to decide what is a sufficient punishment for the offense. Sometimes penalties can be sued for only by the parties immediately injured; but, as a general rule, and unless it is otherwise restricted, anybody may sue for the P.; for in an offense against public law, where there is no public prosecutor, any person who chooses may set the law in motion. Accordingly, not only may anybody in general sue for the P., but an inducement is offered by declaring the party who does so to be entitled to the whole or a half of the P. Without such inducement, many offenses would be unpunished. The party who so sues is generally called the informer. Sometimes the P. can be sued for only in the superior courts of law; but in the great majority of instances, the enforcing of penalties is part of the administration of justice before justices of the peace. It is for the justices to fix the amount if they have (as they gener ally have) a discretion to do so. If it is not paid, the justices may issue a distress-warrant, authorizing a constable to seize and sell the goods of the party to pay the fine; and if there are no goods, then the justices may commit the party to prison as a substitutionary punishment. Sometimes justices have a discretion either to impose a P. or commit the party to prison as an alternative punishment.\n",

      "country; but about the 4th c., the public penitential disci pline assumed a settled form, which, especially in the Greek Church, is remarkable. Sinners of the classes above referred to had their names enrolled; and were (in some churches, after having made a preliminary confession to a priest appointed for the purpose) admitted, with a blessing and other ceremonial, by the bishop to the rank of penitents. This enrolment appears to have been usually on the first day of Lent. The penites so enrolled were arranged in four grades, called-1. (Gr. prosklaiontes, Lat. flentes) Weepers;' 2 (Gr. akroōmenoi, Lat. audientes) Hear ers;' 3. (Gr. hypopiptontes, Lat. prosternentes) Prostraters;'\n",
      "4. (Gr. systantes, Lat. consistentes) Standers.' Of these classes, the first were obliged to remain outside of the church at the time of public worship, and to ask the pray. ers of the faithful as they entered. The second were permitted to enter and to remain in the place and during the time appointed for the Catechumens (q.v.); but, like them, were required to depart before the commencement of the solemn part of the Liturgy (q.v.).

Still it was in the power of the bishop to abridge or to prolong it; a power, the exercise of which is connected with the historical origin of the practice of Indulgence (q.v.). Of these four grades, the first two scarcely appear in the Western Church. It is a subject of controversy whether, and how far, this discipline was extended to other than public sinners; but it seems certain that individuals, not publicly known as sinners, voluntarily enrolled themselves among the penitents. All four grades wore a distinguishing penitential dress, in which they appeared on all occasions of public worship, and were obliged to observe certain rules of life, to renounce certain indulgences and luxuries, and to practice certain austerities.\n",

Hence the square of the time of revolution is directly as the length of the string and the sine of the angle BOP, and inversely as the earth's attraction and the tangent of the same angle; or (what is easily seen to be equivalent) to the length of the string and the cosine of its inclination to the vertical directly, and to the earth's attraction inversely.

It is, however, found almost impossible in practice to render the path absolutely straight; so that there always is from this cause a slight rate of change in the position of the line of oscillation. But as the direction of this change depends on the direction of rotation in the ellipse, it is as likely to affect the motion in one way as in the opposite, and is thus easily separable from the very curious result obtained by Foucault, that on account of the earth's rotation, the plane of vibration of the pendu lum appears to turn in the same direction as the sun, that is, in the opposite direction to the earth's rotation about it axis. To illustrate this now well-known case, consider for a moment a simple pendulum vibrating at the pole of the earth. Here, if the pendulum vibrates in a straight line, the direction of that line remains absolutely fixed in space, while the earth turns round below it once in 24 hours. To a spectator on the earth it appears, of course, as if the plane of motion of the pendulum were turning once round in 24 hours, but in the opposite direction. find the amount of the corresponding phenomenon in any other latitude, all that is required is to know the rate of the earth's rotation about the vertical in that latitude.\n",

But it is easily shown, though the process cannot be given here, that a rigid body of any form whatever vibrates about an axis under the action of gravity, according to the same law as the hypothetical simple pendulum. The length of the equivalent simple pendulum depends upon what is called the Radius of Gyration (q.v.) of the pendulous body. Its property is simply this, that if the whole mass of the body were collected at a point whose distance from the axis is the radius of gyration, the Moment (q.v.) of inertia of this heavy point (about the axis) would be the same as that of the complex body. The square of the radius of gyration of a body about any axis is greater than the square of the radius of gyration about a parallel axis through the centre of gravity, by the square of the distance between those lines. Now, the length of the simple pendulum equivalent to a body oscillating about any axis is directly as the square of the radius of gyration, and inversely as the distance of the centre of gravity from the axis. Hence, if k be the radius of gyration of a body about an axis through the centre of gravity, k²+h² is that about a parallel axis\n",

      "and the length, I, of the k⁹ +h³ equivalent simple pendulum is l= h\n",
      "This expression becomes infinitely great if h be very large, and also if h be very small (that is, a body vibrates very slowly about an axis either far from, or near to, its centre of gravity). It must therefore have a minimum value. By solving the equation above as a quadratic in h, we find that I cannot be less than 2k, which is, therefore, the length of the simple pendulum corresponding to the quickest vibrations which the body can execute about any axis parallel to the given one.\n",
      "In this case, the value of h is equal to k. Hence, if a circular cylinder be described in a body, its axis passing through the centre of gravity, and its radius being the radius of gyration about the axis, the times of oscillation about all generating lines of this cylinder are equal, and less than the times of oscillation about any other axis parallel to the given one. Also, since the formula for l, above given, may be thus written, hl-h) = k², it is obvious that it is satisfied if l h be put for h. Hence, if any value (not less than 2k) be assigned as the length of the equivalent simple pendulum, there are two values of h which will satisfy the conditions; that is, there are two concentric cylinders, about a generating line of either of which the time of oscillation is that of the assigned simple pendulum. When = 2k, these cylinders coincide, and form that above described. And, since the sum of the radii of these cylinders is l, it is obvious that if we can find experimentally two parallel axes about which a body oscillates in equal times, and if the centre of gravity of the body lie between these axes, and in their plane, the distance between these axes is the length of the equivalent simple pendulum. This result is of great importance it enabled Kater (the first to employ it) to use the complex pendulum for determination of the length of the simple second's pendulum in any locality.

      "the method of correction usually employed, called compensation, advantage is taken of the fact that different substances have different coefficients of linear dilatation; so that if the bob of the pendulum be so suspended as to be raised by the expansion of one substance, and depressed by the expansion of another, the lengths of the effective por tions of these substances may be so adjusted that the raising and depression, taking place simultaneously, may leave the position of the bob unaffected. There are two common methods of effecting this, differing a little in construction, but depend ing ultimately on the same principle. Or these, the mercurial pendulum is the more easily described. The rod AC, and the framework CB, are of steel. Inside the framework is placed a cylindrical glass jar, nearly full of mercury, which can be raised or depressed by turning a nut at B. By increase of temperature, the steel portion AB is lengthened by an amount proportional to Bits length, its coefficient of linear dilatation, and the change of temperature, conjointlyand thus the jar of mercury is removed from the axis of suspension. But neglecting the expansion of the glass, which is very small, the mercury rises in the jar by an amount proportional to its bulk, its coefficient of cubical dilatation, and the change of temperature, conjointly. Now, by increasing or diminishing the quantity of mercury, it is obvious that we may so adjust the instru-\n",

The screw at B has nothing to do with the compensation; its use is to adjust the length of the pendulum so that it shall vibrate in one second.\n",
      "The construction of the gridiron pendulum will be understood from the cut. The black bars are steel, the shaded ones are brass, copper, or some substance whose coefficient of linear dilatation is more than double that of steel. It is obvious from the figure that the horizontal bars are merely connectors, and that their expansion has nothing to do with the vibration of the pendulum-so they may be made of any substance. It is easily seen that an increase of temperature lowers the bob by expanding the steel rods, whose effective length consists of the sum of the lengths of Aa, BC, and the steel bar to which the bob is attached; while it raises the bob by expanding the brass bars, whose effective length is that of one of them only; the other, as well as the steel rod bc, being added to the instrument for symmetry, strength, and stiffness only. If the effective lengths of steel and brass be inversely as their respective dilatation coefficients, the position of the bob is unaltered by temperature; therefore the pendulum will vibrate in the same period as before heating.

Where coal is not used in a locality, or where it furnishes only a portion of the fuel, the value of wood or other fuel used is regarded as the value of the coal displaced, and an estimate of the tonnage of coal that would be displaced is made, based on the selling price of coal in that locality. This plan of ascertaining the amount of coal that natural gas displaces is now considered the best basis for calculating the consumption of this gas for domestic and manufacturing purposes. By this rule the displacement of coal by natural gas in P. was (1885) 3,000,000 short tons, value $4,500,000; (1886) 6,000,000 tons, value $9,000,000; (1887) 8,883,000 tons, value $13,749,500; and (1888) 12,443,830 tons, value $19,282,375.

Pensions are often increased by re-rating, limited now by the law to results of gun-shot wounds, and to cases of disease erroneously adjudicated, provided the appeal be made within 12 mos. after rating. Additional pension may be claimed on all the new disabilities that the applicant may have overlooked or the department may have ignored; lost pensions may be restored; rejected claims reopened; ' charge of desertion removed' (by pension attorneys). A series of bounties, from $100 to $400, are open to claim by soldiers or their heirs.

This time he took Ravenna, Emilia, the Pentapolis, and the duchy of Rome, from the Lombards, reuniting them to the Holy See. After the settlement of affairs in Italy, the turbulent nations on his e. frontier demanded his attention. The Saxons and other German tribes were defeated (757), their country cruelly ravaged, a heavy tribute exacted, and numbers of captives and hostages taken. Resolved to unite the whole of Gaul under his authority, he eagerly accepted the invitation of the Visigoths of Septimania to aid them against the Arabs who had taken possession of the country; and after a war of many years' duration, Narbonne, last of the Arab strongholds, was taken, and the country, freed of these invaders, at once acknowledged P.'s authority. The remaining years of his reign were occupied in reducing the independent monarchy of Aquitaine, which was not accomplished till, after nine years (760-768) of desolating warfare, P. obtained the assassination of his opponent, Duke Waifre, whose partizans then laid down their arms, surrendering to the Frankish monarch the vast provinces which stretch from the Loire to the ocean and the Pyrenees. Shortly after this conquest, P. died of dropsy. He was a most active, enterprising, and, in general, fortunate prince; he established the unity of the Gallic nation, and protected it, as far as could be done, by invading and ravaging the territories of the neighboring nations, though he also introduced elements of weakness into its constitution which deplorably reduced the authority of his successors.\n",

At the Reformation, the ceremonies and practices deemed objectionable were abolished, and only the useful and harmless part of the custom retained.' Yet its observance was considered so desirable that a homily was prepared for the occasion; and injunctions were issued requiring that, for the perambulation of the circuits of the parishes, the people should once in the year, at the time accustomed, with the rector, vicar, or curate, and the substantial men of the parish, walk about the parishes, as they were accustomed, and, at their return to the church, make their common prayer. And the curate, in their said common perambulations, was at certain convenient places to admonish the people to give thanks to God (while beholding of his benefits), and for the increase and abundance of his fruits upon the face of the earth, with the saying of the 103d Psalm. At which time also the said minister was required to inculcate these or such like sentences, Cursed be he which translateth the bounds and doles of his neighbor; or such other order of prayers as should be lawfully ap pointed.'

If a house had been erected on the boundaryline, the procession claimed the right to pass through it. A house in Buckinghamshire, still standing, has an oven passing over the boundary-line. It was customary in the perambulations to put a boy into this recess, to preserve the integrity of the boundary-line. At various parts of the parish boundaries, two or three of the village boys were bumped '-that is, a certain part of the person was swung against a stone wall, a tree, a post, or any other hard object which happened to be near the parish boundary.

P., considered as a source of knowledge, refers exclusively to the outer or the object world-the world of extended matter and its properties.

There was obviously some great mistake in a mode of reasoning that brought about a dead-lock of this description; hence it has been the work of metaphysical philosophy since that time to endeavor to put the perception of the world on an admissible footing.\n",

A certain movement of the eye shuts it out, another restores it. The raising of the head and the bending of the body are followed by an altered spectacle. We cannot but draw a broad distinction between the mental scenery that is thus shifted by all our movements, and the ideas and dreams that vary of themselves while we are still. To express the one fact, we use the terms externality, the material world, independent existence; to express the other, we employ the opposite language-internality, the world of mind, etc. Even if sensation were only in ourselves, we should still have to distinguish between present sensation and remembered or revived sensation; the reference of the one to our voluntary movements, and of the other to no such modifying causes, would oblige us to note a vital difference in the two classes of facts. Such is the uniformity of connection between certain appearances and certain movements, that we come to anticipate the one through the other. We know that in some one position, as when lying in bed, certain movements of the limbs and back will bring us to the sensation of a solid contact in the feet; that another series of movements will bring on a particular view to the sight; that a third movement will give the sound of a bell in the ear, and so forth.

The Percida, or P. family, have the body somewhat oblong and more or less compressed; the scales rather large; the bones of the gill-covers toothed or otherwise armed; the mouth without barbels; the vomer toothed, generally the palate also; there are sometimes two dorsals, sometimes only one. To this family belong not only the true perches, all of which are freshwater fishes, but, the Lates (q.v.) of the Nile, the Bass (q.v.) or Sea P., and their congeners, the Pike-perches (q.v.), the Serrani, and many other fishes. The true perches (Perca) have two dorsal fins, distinct and separate, the rays of the first spinous and those of the second flexible; the tongue is smooth; and the gill-covers are bony, notched, and sharply serrated.

It often attains a length of 16 or 18 inches, and a weight of 2 or 3 lbs. ; but perches have been taken of 8 lbs. weight or more. The P. loves still waters, and is easily reared in ponds; but it is not a desirable inmate of ponds intended for other fish, because it is very voracious, and devours their fry. It is readily caught by almost any kind of bait, and sometimes takes a small artificial fly. It is much esteemed for the table. It lives a long time out of the water if kept moist, and in some countries is thus brought to market, and carried back to the pond if not sold.

The fluid, however dark-colored, when it reaches the globular glass is beautifully bright and clear, and the preparations so made are remarkable for good quality and uniformity of strength. Redwood's percolator (invented 1864) has great efficacy. It consists of a tinned copper cylinder, with a smaller cylinder of flannel inside, in which the materials are put. The whole is filled with the fluid menstruum, and as that which is in more immediate contact with the solid materials becomes charged with the soluble matter displaced, it gives rise, as its density is increased, to an endosmotic action through the flannel walls of the inner cylinder, until the whole is equalized, when it is drawn off by the tap, and fresh fluid added until it comes away colorless. The outer cylinder has a tight cover to prevent loss by evaporation.\n",

      "The instrument usually sold as a pleximeter is a flat, oval piece of ivory; but the left index or middle finger of the physician, with its flat surface fitted accurately to the part to be examined, serves equally well. The force of the stroke on the pleximeter-whether with use of the fingers or the mallet-must vary according as it is desired to elicit the sound from a superficial or a deep-seated part. The surface to be percussed should be exposed, or covered with, at most, only one layer of clothing; and the blow should fall perpendicularly on the pleximeter. When P. is made over a considerable cavity filled with air-e.g., the stomach or intestines-a hollow, drum-like, or (as it is usually termed by medical writers) tympanitic sound is produced. When any part of the surface of the chest is struck below which there is considerable depth of healthy lung-tissue consisting of small cells filled with air, a clear sound is evolved, less loud and hollow than the tympanitic sound, and termed the pulmonary percussionnote, depending partly on the vibrations of air in the lung-cells, and partly on the vibrations of the walls of the chest. When the subjacent substance is solid (as the heart, liver, or spleen) or fluid (e.g., when there is effusion into a closed sac), the sound is dull in proportion to the density and want of elasticity of the part struck.\n",

P. lived to see four editions of it, and to receive the warm commendations of all poetical readers and critics. The Reliques were obtained chiefly from an old folio MS. that had fallen into P.'s hands, with the addition of pieces from the Pepys collection at Cambridge, the Ashmole Library at Oxford, the British Museum, and the works of the earlier English poets. Certain liberties were taken with some of the ballads-softening touches, repairs, and renovations for which the editor was severely censured by Ritson and other antiquaries; but this point was generally deemed of only minor importance; and the collection was accepted with delight as of great value to English literature, recalling the public taste to the rude energy, picturesqueness, and passion of the old chivalrous minstrels and Elizabethan songsters.\n",

      "found in almost all parts of the world. The female is arger than the male, being about 18 in. long from tip of bill to tip of tail, while the male is only about 15 inches. The female is the Falcon of falconers, and the male the Tercel. The plumage of the two sexes is very similar. The back, wings, and tail are bluish-slate or ash-gray, the feathers barred with a darker tint; the crown of the head, back of the neck, and a spot below the eye, nearly black; the front of the neck is white, with dark longitudinal lines; the breast, belly, and plumage of the legs, whitish, with dark-brown transverse bars. The wings are very long, reaching almost to the tip of the tail; and the bird is remarkable for power of flight, being capable of maintaining for a considerable time a rate of more than 100 m. ar hour, so that it is often seen far from any of its haunts or breeding-places; whence the name Peregrine, from the Latin peregrinus, a wanderer. Its swoop, when rushing on its quarry, is wonderful for rapidity and force. The P. F. can easily carry through the air a bird or quadruped fully its own weight. Its ordinary prey consists of grouse, woodcocks, rabbits, etc. The woodcock in vain seeks to escape from it by threading its way among branches of trees and brushwood; the falcon follows, and exhibits at least an equal power of moving with great rapidity in the thicket without getting entangled or stayed. Sometimes the quarry soars into the air, and seeks safety by trying to keep above the falcon, till both are lost to ordinary sight; but the falcon generally gets uppermost, and 'strikes' it at last. It has thus been known to cut a snipe in two, and at one swoop to strike off the head of a grouse or pigeon. Owing to the quantity of game the P. F. will capture, it is ruthlessly trapped or otherwise destroyed, so that this beautiful bird is in danger, like others of its family, of being exterminated.\n",

      "ganizations are accordingly blunders; there had been no visible church of Christ on earth since the apostolic age to his day. He believed that Christ, on his second advent in the spirit,' A.D. 70, abolished the old Law, and closed the reign of sin which began with Adam; and that he has thenceforth set up his kingdom in the hearts of all willing to accept his reign. For such persons, there was no longer any law or rule of duty; neither the Mosaic code, nor the Sermon on the Mount, nor the ordinances or institutions of civil society, were binding on them; they were a law unto themselves; they were free to do as they pleased, but-with exceptions which, however, could not invalidate an eternal truth--under the influence of the Divine Spirit, which dwelt in them, they could do only that which was right: they were perfect-hence their name.\n",

Having dispensed with law, he set up public opinion as a controlling power in its stead. Quarrelling, however, broke out among the members; their differences were brought before the law courts; and when the details of the Family system became known, the people of Putney made the place too hot for the Perfectionists.\n",

Long before that time, however, fragrant waters were in use in Arabia. Odor-bearing plants contain the fragrant principle in minute glands or sacs; these are found sometimes in the rind of the fruit, as the lemon and orange; in others, in the leaves, as sage, mint, and thyme; in the wood, as rosewood and sandal-wood; in the bark, as cassia and cinnamon; in the seeds, as caraway and nutmeg. These glands or bags of fragrance may be plainly seen in a thin-cut stratum of orange-peel; also in a bay leaf, held up to the sunlight, all the oil cells may be seen like specks.

      "not made by distillation, but by the processes of enfleurage and maceration. Although this mode of obtaining the odors from flowers has certainly been in practice for two centuries in the valley of the Var, in s. France, it is only by the publication of a recent work that the method has been made generally known (see Art of Perfumery, by Septimus Piesse, PH.D., 8vo, 50 cuts; Longman; 4th ed. 1880). The odors of flowers do not, as a general rule, exist in them as a store or in a gland, but are developed as an exhalation. While the flower breathes, it yields fragrance; kill the flower, and fragrance ceases. It has not been ascertained when the discovery was made of condensing, as it were, the breath of the flower during life; what we know now is, that if a living flower be placed near to grease, animal fat, butter, or oil, these bodies absorb the odor given off by the blossom, and in turn themselves become fragrant. If we spread fresh unsalted butter on the bottom of two dessert-plates, and then fill one of the plates with gathered fragrant blossoms of clematis, covering them over with the second greased plate, we shall find that after 24 hours the grease has become fragrant. The blossoms, though separated from the parent stem, do not die for some time, but live and exhale odor; which is absorbed by the fat. To remove the odor from the fat, the fat must be scraped off the plates and put into alcohol; the odor then leaves the grease and enters into the spirit, which thus becomes 'scent,' and the grease again becomes odorless.\n",
      "The flower farmers of the Var follow precisely this method on a very large scale, with little practical variation, with the following flowers-rose, orange, acacia, violet, jasmine, tuberose, and jonquil. The process is termed enfleurage. In the valley of the Var, there are acres of Jasmine, of tuberose, of violets, and the other flowers named; in due season the air is laden with fragrance-the flower harvest is at hand. Women and children gather the blossoms, which they place in little panniers like fishermen's baskets, hung over the shoulders. They are then carried to the laboratory of flow ers, and weighed. In the laboratory the harvest of flowers has been anticipated. During the previous winter, great quantities of grease, lard, and beef-suet have been collected, melted, washed, and clarified. In each laboratory are several thousand châssis (sashes), or famed glasses, upon which the grease to be scented is spread, and on this grease the blossoms are sprinkled or laid. The châsse en verre is, in fact, a frame with a glass in it as near as possible like a window-sash, only that the frame is two inches thicker, so that when one châsse is placed on another there is a space of four inches between every two glasses, thus allowing space for blossoms. The illustration shows the châsse with grease and flowers upon it (fig. 1), also a pile of the same as in use. The flower blossoms are changed every day, or every other day, as may be convenient in regard\n",

      "CLASS IV. P, n.-The principal are Musk (q.v.), Ambergris (q.v.), Civet (q.v.), and Castor (q.v.). The aroma of musk is the most universally favorite of all perfumes; it freely imparts odor to every body with which it is in contact. Its power to impart odor is such, that polished steel will become fragrant of it if the metal be shut in a box where there is musk, contact not being necessary. In perfumery manufacture, musk is mixed with other odorous bodies to give permanence to a scent. The usual statement as to the length of time that musk continues to give out odor has been called in question. If fine musk be spread in thin layers upon any surface, and fully exposed to a changing current of air, all fragrance, it is said, will be gone in six to twelve months. Civet is exceedingly potent as an odor, and when pure, and smelled at in the bulk of about an ounce, is utterly insupportable from its nauseousness: in this respect it exceeds musk. When, however, civet is diluted so as to offer but minute quantities to the olfactories, then its perfume is generally admitted; this is so with gas-tar; but the fragrant principle is the same as that breathed by the beautiful narcissus. Castor is in our day almost obsolete as a perfume.\n",

When there is a large amount of liquid effusion (a third of a pint or more) which is not reabsorbed, death usually occurs in a few days, in consequence of the interference of the fluid with the heart's actions; but when there is not much liquid effusion, or when the liquid part is absorbed, the pericardium becomes more or less adherent, and apparent recovery usually takes place.\n",
      "In the cases that prove fatal when fibrinous fluid has been effused, but has not coagulated to such an extent as to cause complete adhesion of the heart to the pericardium, the partially coagulated fibrin (or lymph, as the older authors styled it) is seen to be of yellowishwhite color, and to occur in a rugged, shaggy, or cellular form. Laennec compared the surface on which the lymph is deposited to that which would be produced by suddenly separating two flat pieces of wood between which a thin layer of butter had been compressed.

      "The symptoms of P. are pain in the situation of the heart, increased by a full inspiration, by pressure upon or between the ribs in the cardiac region, and especially by pressure upward against the diaphragm by thrusting the fingers beneath the cartilages of the false ribs; palpitations; a dry cough and hurried respiration; discomfort or pain on lying on the left side; restlessness; great anxiety of countenance; and sometimes delirium. The pulse usually beats 110 to 120 in a minute, and is sometimes intermittent; and febrile symptoms are always present. These symptoms are seldom collectively present in any individual case, and until the time of Louis the diagnosis of this disease was uncertain and obscure.\n",
      "T: 1. In consequence of irritation propagated to the muscular tissue of the heart at the commencement of the inflammation of its investing membrane, the ventricles contract with increased force, rendering the sounds of the heart louder and its impulse stronger than in health, or than in the more advanced stages of the disease. 2. When much fluid is effused into the pericardium, dulness on percussion is always observable to a greater degree than in health: this sign, very characteristic, is seldom perceived till the disease has continued two or three days. In relation to this increased dulness, it should be premised that in the healthy condition of the heart and lungs there is an irregular roundish space, with a diameter somewhat less than two inches, extending from the sternum (or breastbone), between the level of the fourth and fifth ribs, toward the left nipple, in which a portion of the surface of the heart is not overlapped by the lungs, but lies in contact with the walls of the chest. This space should normally be dull on percussion. In P. the extent of the dulness beyond the normal limit indicates the amount of effusion. In extreme cases the dulness may extend over a space whose diameter is seven inches or more.\n",
      "Simultaneous with tho increased dulness, there is diminution of the heart's sounds in consequence of the intervening fluid, and the impulse is often scarcely perceptible. 3. The rubbing of the inflamed and roughened surfaces upon each other gives rise to a sound commonly called the friction sound, but which has received various names. Thus, Dr. Watson calls it a to and fro sound, and observes regarding its variations that, like all the other morbid sounds heard within the chest, it is capable of much variety in tone and degree. Sometimes it very closely resembles the noise made by a saw in cutting through a board; sometimes it is more like that occasioned by the action of a file or of a rasp; but its essential character is that of alternate rubbing; it is a to\n",

      "and fro sound.' This sound is heard early in the disease, before the surfaces of the pericardium are separated by the effusion of fluid; and it is due either to dryness of the membrane, or to its roughness from deposition of lymph. When the contiguous surfaces are either separated by fluid, or become adherent, the sound disappears; but when it has been lost from the first of these causes, it reappears after the fluid has been so far absorbed as to permit the surfaces again to come in contact. But nere, again, its duration is brief, for the surfaces soon become adherent and cease to rub upon each other.\n",
      "P. is a disease which occasionally runs a very rapid course, and terminates fatally in 48 hours or less. In ordinary cases, however, which terminate in apparent recovery, the disease generally begins to yield in a week or ten days; and excepting that adhesion remains, the cure appears complete in three weeks or less. But though these patients apparently recover, the pericardial adhesion commonly occasions other structural changes of the heart sooner or later to develop themselves; and in those cases that the physician has the opportunity of subsequently watching, it is observed that fatal disease of the heart, primarily due to the P., almost always supervenes. In slight cases it is probable that a truc cure, without adhesion, may take place.\n",

      "PERICLES: the most accomplished statesman of ancient Greece: born of distinguished Athenian parentage in the early part of B.C. 5th c.; d. B.C. 429, autumn. His father was that Xanthippus who won the victory over the Persians at Mycale, B.C. 479; and his mother, Agariste, was niece of the great Athenian reformer Cleisthenes, and was connected with the great house of the Alemæonidæ. P. received an elaborate education; but of all his teachers, the one whom he most reverenced, and from whose instructions he derived most benefit, was the philosopher Anaxagoras (q.v.). P. was conspicuous all through his career for the singular dignity of his manners, the Olympian' thunder of his eloquence, his sagacity, probity, and profound Athenian patriotism. When he entered on public life, Aristides had only recently died, Themistocles was an exile, and Cimon was fighting the battles of his country abroad. Although the family to which he belonged was good, it did not rank among the first in either wealth or influence; yet so transcendent were the abilities of P., that he rapidly rose to the highest power in the state as the leader of the dominant democracy. The sincerity of his attachment to the popular' party has been questioned, but without the shadow of evidence.\n",
      "At any rate, the measures which either personally or through his adherents he brought forward, and caused to be passed, were always in favor of extending the privileges of the poorer class of the citizens. P. seems to have grasped very clearly, and to have held as firmly, the modern radical' idea, that as the state is supported by the taxation of the body of the citizens, it must gov、 ern with a view to general and not to caste interests.\n",
      "B.C. 461, P., through the agency of his follower, Ephial, tes, struck a great blow at the influence of the oli garchy, by causing the decree to be passed which deprived the Areopagus of its most important political powers. Shortly afterward the democracy obtained another triumph in the ostracism of Cimon. During the next few years the political course pursued by P. is not clearly discernible, but in general his attitude was hostile to the desire for foreign conquest or territorial aggrandizement, so prevalent among his ambitious fellow-citizens. B.C. 454, or shortly afterward, he mag nanimously proposed the measure (which was carried) for the recall of Cimon, and about the same time commenced negotiations with the other Hellenic states with the view of forming a grand Hellenic confederation, the design of which was to put an end to the mutually destructive wars of kindred peoples-to make of Greece one mighty nation, fit to front the outlying world. The idea was sagacious and noble. Had it been accomplished, the semi-barbarous Macedonians would have menaced the civilized Greeks in vain, and even Rome at a later period might perhaps have found the Adriatic, and not the Euphrates, the limits of her empire. But the Spartan aristocrats were utterly incapable of mor-\n",

      "1,461 Egyptian years, after the lapse of which the dates in both reckonings coincided. By comparing the solar and lunar years, Meton, an Athenian, invented B.C. 432 a lunar period of 6,940 days, called from him the Metonic Cycle (q.v.), also the Lunar Cycle. About a century afterward, the cycle of Meton was discovered to be an insufficient approximation to the truth; and as he had made the solar year too long by about of a day, at the end of 4 Metonic cycles the solar reckoning was found to be in advance of the lunar by about 1 day, 6 hours. To remedy this, a new period, the Calippic Period, was invented by Calippus, consisting of 4 Metonic cycles less by one day, or 27,759 days. But as this period still gave a difference of 6 hours between the solar and lunar reckonings, it was improved by Hipparchus, who invented the Hipparchic Period of 4 Calippic periods less by one day, or 111,035 days, or about 304 Julian years, which is an exceedingly close approximation, being only 6 minutes too long, when measured by the tropical year; and too short, but by an almost inappreciable quantity, when measured by the Synodic Month (see MONTH). The Period of the Heliacal or Solar Cycle, after which the same day of the month falls on the same day of the week, consists of 28 Julian years. If the year had regularly consisted of 365 days, that is, one day more than an exact num. ber of weeks, it is evident that, at the end of seven years, the days of the month and week would again correspond; but the introduction of an intercalary day into every fourth year causes this coincidence to recur at irregular periods of 6, 11, 6, and 5 years successively.\n",
      "However, by choosing a period such as will preserve the leap-years in the same relative position to the other years, and at the same time consist of an exact number of weeks (both of which objects are effected by using the number 28, which is the least common multiple of 4 and 7), we insure the regular recurrence of the coinci dence between the days of the week and of the month.\n",

The alternation of sleep and waking, the phenomena of menstruation, and the punctual return of hunger, are some obvious instances of P. in the healthy subject; while less obvious examples are afforded by the apparently regular variations that have been observed in the excretion of carbonic acid from the lungs, and in the number of the pulsations of the heart at different periods of the 24 hours. As is well known by experience, P. may be usefully cultivated and fixed in daily habits. This is exemplified in the case of sleep, and in special degree by the daily relieving of the bowels at a particular hour, a habit in which it is important that all young persons should be carefully instructed, with a view to health and convenience (see\n",

They have beenas regards their political position-compared to the Saxons of England after the Norman conquest. The P. must have been very numerous, for they occupied at one time more than 100 cities, several of which were on the coast, whence the whole seaboard of Laconia bore the name of the Perioikis; and they produced capital sailors, which doubtless accounts for the anomalous fact of P. being occasionally invested with the command of the Spartan fleet. They also formed a part of the Spartan army. At the battle of Platæa, B.C. 479, there were 10,000 P. present. These dependent Achaians were not, however, all on a dead level of vassalage; they lived in regularly organized communities, where the social distinctions of rank, refinement, and wealth were as marked as elsewhere.

      "PERIOS TEUM: tough fibrous membrane which sur rounds the various bones. It is highly vascular, and is the means by which the outer layers of the shafts and the greater part of the spongy portions of the bones are supplied with blood. From the internal surface of the P. also is produced a layer of soft blastema (or plastic fluid in which cells are developed), by means of which additions are made to the exterior of the growing bones. The process of ossification going on in the inner part of this blastema contributes to the thickness of the bone, while a fresh supply is continually being added to the exterior of the blastema, through the medium of the vessels of the periosteum.' -Humphry On the Human Skeleton, p. 19. In young bones, this membrane is thick, and, in consequence of the intervening blastema, is very easily detached from the bone; but in the bones of the adult it is less thick and vascular, while its connection with the bone becomes closer, in consequence of the blastema being less; while in aged persons it is very thin, its vessels are scanty, and there is no blastema. Numerous experiments show that the formation of bone is essentially due to the action of this membrane; and that, by transplanting detached portions of P. into muscular or other tissues, bony tissue is generated in those parts. In most cases in which this membrane has become detached in consequence of a wound or of disease, the exposed bone (except in the instance of the skull, which derives most of its nutrient matter from the dura-mater) perishes; but this is not invariably the case. Among its other offices, it serves, by isolating the bone from the surrounding tissues, to prevent the spread of disease from them to it. The shin-bone or tibia is thus indebted to the P. for its ordinary immunity in cases of ulcer in that region. In those parts in which the bone is not so completely isolated from the surrounding tissues, as at the ends of the bones of the fingers and toes, inflammation of the soft parts not unfrequently extends to the bony structure.\n",
      "PERIOSTITIS: inflammation of the membrane cov ering the bone; occurring generally on the surface of thinly covered bones, such as the tibia, clavicles, and cranial bones. Its chief causes are (1) a syphilitic taint, in which oval swellings, called Nodes (q.v.), are produced; (2) rheumatism; and (3) scrofula. In the two latter cases, there is a periosteal swelling around the whole circumference or surface of the bone. The affection, especially when due to the first or second of the above causes, is usually accompanied with considerable nocturnal pain. The disease in acute form is treated with leeches, fomentations, and the other ordinary antiphlogistic (or lowering) remedies. In almost all cases, the nocturnal pains are best relieved by doses (five to ten grains) of iodide of potassium, taken three times a day on an empty stomach.\n",

The tractors, he claimed, were of peculiar and secret composition, but it is asserted that one was of iron, the other brass; they were three inches long, and pointed.

Dr. P.'s son published a book, in London, introducing the method; and there it inspired so much faith that a Perkinsian institution was opened, of which Lord Rivers was president. Recommendations were signed by many physicians and clergymen, and thousands of cures published. Heated discussions arose, and a satire, Terrible Tractoration, was put forth by Thomas G. Fessenden, in defense of the tractors. The history of this supposed remedy belongs doubtless among the many illustrations of the power of the mental state over the physical.

      "PERPETUAL MOTION, THE: term denoting a ma chine whose motion would continue forever, or till the parts of the machine were worn out. According to Newton's First Law (see MOTION, LAWS OF), all unresisted motion continues forever unchanged. Thus, if friction could be avoided, a top or a gyroscope spinning in vacuo is an instance of motion which would be unchanged forever, and which, therefore, might be called perpetual.\n",
      "T, a.' The same cause influences the motion of the gyroscope, but in its case there is another retarding influence at work, due to the production of electric currents by the magnetism of the earth. But this is not what is technically understood by the title The Perpetual Motion, which denotes a mechanical construction that, without any supply of power from without, can not only maintain its own motion forever, or as long as its materials last, but can also be applied to drive machinery, and therefore to do external work. In other words, it means a device for creating power or energy without corresponding expenditure. This is now known to be absolutely impossible, whatever physical forces may be employed. In fact, the modern physical axiom, the Conservation of Energy (see FORCE) founded on experimental bases as certain as those which convince us of the truth of the Laws of Motion, may be expressed, in the negative, thus: The perpetual motion is impossible. Helmholtz's beautiful investigations regarding Conservation of Energy (referred to in FORCE) are founded on this axiom.\n",

      "tice, that Newton was far in advance of the greatest of his contemporaries and their immediate successors, in even the fundamental notions of mechanics. Thus, we find John Bernouilli, seriously propounding a form of the P. M., depending on the alternate mixture, and sep. aration by a filter, of two liquids of different densities; an arrangement as preposterous as the very common suggestion of a water-wheel which should pump up its own supply of water; and whose absurdity must be evident to any one acquainted with Newton's chapter on the Laws of Motion. It is curious that, long before Newton's time, the physical axiom, that the P. M. is impossible, was assumed by Stevinus as a foundation for the science of Statics. This is particularly interesting when we compare it with the magnificent discoveries which have been evolved in our own day from the same principle applied to the physical forces generally, and not to gravitation alone, as contemplated by Stevinus. His process is as follows: Let an endless chain of uniform weight be passed round a smooth triangular prism ABC, of which the face BC is horizontal. The free portion of the chain, BDC, will hang in a symmetrical curve (CAT- ENARY, q.v.), and its tension will therefore be the same at B and at C. Hence the other portion, BAC, of the chain will be free to move, unless the resolved part of the weight of AB, acting down the inclined plane AB, just balance that of the corresponding portion of the chain down AC. If these balance, the parallelogram of forces is proved; if not, one side will preponderate, and we shall evidently obtain the P. M.\n",

The machine, being a combination of mechanical powers driven by weights, was to be constructed so as constantly to wind up those weights as they fell, and therefore to be constantly in the same circumstances as to power in each successive complete revolution. The ideal of this, in its simplest form, is that of a wheel moving about a horizontal axis, and so adjusting certain heavy sliding pieces, on its surface, as to have always a preponderance on one particular side. 2. The type of the second class differs from that of the first only in the substitution of liquids for the weights in the first class, and the consequent introduction (often in most extravagant forms) of hydrostatical laws, which the inventors seem to have considered less certain and more pliable than the stern facts of common mechanics. 3.

This principle applies not only to land, but to personal property. As to the accumulation of the income of property, an attempt was made by Mr. Thellusson to create an immense fortune by directing the income of his property to be accumulated during the lives of all his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, who were living at the time of his death, for the benefit of some future descendants, to be living at the death of the survivor.

The will was in great measure defeated by the existing law; but in consequence of so conspicuous an attempt, an act of parliament was passed, called the Thellusson Act (39 and 40 Geo. III. c. 98), which in future forbids the accumulation of income for any longer time than the life of the granter or settler, or 21 years from his death. See\n",

The notion of ten such periods is commonly accepted almost as an historical axiom; but this precise determination of the number is comparatively recent. In the 4th c., no settled theory of the number of persecutions seems to have been adopted. Lactantius reckons but six; Eusebius does not state the number, though his narrative supplies data for nine. Sulpicius Severus, 5th c., is the first who expressly states the number at ten; but he enumerates only nine in detail, and in completing the number to ten, he adds the general persecution which, at the coming of Antichrist, is to precede the end of the world.

Alexander the Great, in his march of conquest, is said to have destroyed P. completely; but this probably must be understood to apply only to some of the chief palaces.

The situation of these structures, overlooking the vast luxuriant plain of Merdusht, is described in terms of rapturous enthusiasm by every traveller from Chardin to our own day. Three groups are chiefly distinguishable in the vast ruins.

      "PERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS: doctrine, ore of the five points of Calvinism,' resulting logically from the essential parts of the Calvinistic system. As stated in the Westminster Confession of Faith it is that true Christian disciples, called and accepted of God, and sanctified by His Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but shall certainly persevere therein to the end and be eternally saved.' It is advocated not only by arguments from other doctrines, e.g., election, atonement, the intercession and mediatorial dominion of Christ, imputed righteousness, and regeneration, but also from many texts of Scripture, e.g., those which declare eternal life to be always connected with believing, and those which encourage the believer to depend on the faithfulness, love, and omnipotence of God. To an objection commonly urged against it, that it tends to make men careless concerning virtue and holiness, its advocates reply, that this objection is valid only against a doctrine very different from theirs—the true doctrine of final perseverance being one of perseverance in holiness, and giving no encouragement to a confidence of final salvation not connected with a present and even an increasing holiness.

      "governors of provinces and districts, possess similar authority over those under them; their actions, however, are liable to revision by the shah, who may summarily inflict any punishment on them for real or alleged misgovernment. Oppression of the working and mercantile classes is almost a necessity of such a form of gov. ernment. The central government consisted till lately of the Sadri-Azem or Grand Vizier, with various dependent officials. Now there is a ministry, nominally modelled after the cabinets of European states, of which the head is called pres. of the council. He is supported by the ministers of foreign affairs and of war, of justice, of public worship and of mines, of commerce, telegraphs, agriculture, industry, and public works, the commander in-chief, and the master of the ceremonies. The law, which in civil cases is administered by Mollahs (q.v.), ir criminal cases by a state court, is founded on the Koran and on tradition. The usual punishments are tines, flog. ging (the bastinado), and death, by either decapitation, stabbing, or torture. The Beglerbegs or governors of provinces, always chosen from the governing_race, the Turkomans, and generally of the blood-royal, oppress to the utmost the poor Tajiks. They are seldom able, however, to protect their provinces from the ravage of the predatory eylat hordes, who, though nominally subject to the shah, are governed by their own khans, and are really independent. The revenue is derived- (1) From a tax on the gross produce of land, 20 per cent. is supposed to be the amount payable to the crown by the landholders; as a general rule, however, this amount is somewhat exceeded, and 25 per cent. may be taken as the average assessment; (2) Duties on cattle and flocks-in case of goats, sheep, and cows, 8 per cent. on value of wool and butter yielded; (3) Customs dues; (4) Capitation tax of 16 cents on each male over 18 years of age; (5) Rates levied on incomes of artisans and dealers of 20 per cent., and duties on provisions brought to market.

      "19th c., P. was divided into seven or eight great divisions; but about the time when it was attempted to introduce European civilization into the country, and discipline into the army, the country was anew divided into 25 provinces-viz., the three Caspian provinces of Ghilan, Mazanderan, and Astrabad, in the n.; Azerbijan, Ardelan or Persian Kurdistan, Luristan, and Khuzistan, in the w.; Fars. Laristan, and Kerman with Mogistan, in the s.; while the great province of Irak-Ajemi in the centre was divided into Khamsah, Kasbin, Teheran, Hamadan, Kûm, and Ispahan; and that of Khorassan in the e. into Yezd, Tabas, Ghayn and Birjun, Turshiz, Meshid, Damghan, Semnum, and the Dasht Beyad, or the Great Salt Desert. There are many interesting ruins of ancient, populous, and celebrated cities in Persiae.g., Persepolis (q.v.), Rhages or Rhé, Shahpur, Istaklar, Tùs, Merv, Shushan, Hamadan, etc.; and the monuments and inscriptions found at some of these places form a highly-interesting study.

The regular army is really composed of about 30,000 infantry and 1,000 artillery, while there are about 10,000 irregular cavalry, a few thousand irregular infantry, and the guards.

Little has been dore toward extracting the grains of historical truth that may be contained in the mass of fable that constitutes the native Persian annals; though hopes are cherished that by aid of the many inscriptions and monuments daily discovered, light may yet be thrown on many points.

It has still the structure of an ancient organic Indo-Germanic language, with the disinct peculiarities of an Iranic tongue. (3) Pahlavi (q.v.) (West Iranian, Median, and Persian), in use during the period of the Sassanides (after Christ 3d to 7th c.), an idiom largely mixed with Semitic words, and poorer in inflections and terminations than Zend. Its remnants consist of a certain number of books relating to the Zoroastrian religion, of coins and inscriptions; and the language is not quite the same in all cases—according to the larger or smaller infusion of foreign words. The non-Iranian element is known as Huzvaresh, and is simply Chaldee; while the Iranian element differs little from modern Persian. There are three distinct idioms to be distinguished in Pahlavi, and the writing varies accordingly; yet it is not certain whether the difference arises from their belonging to different districts or periods. When, however, Pahlavi ceased to be a living language, and the restoration of the pure Iranian had begun, people, not daring to change the writings, chiefly of a sacred nature, as they had descended to them from the Sassanian times, began to substitute, in reading, the Persian equivalents to the Huzvaresh words. At last a new form of commentaries to the sacred writings sprang up, in which more distinct and clear Zend characters were used, where each sign has but one phonetic value, and where all the foreign Huzvaresh words were replaced by pure Persian ones; and this new form was called (4) Pâzend.

      "T, a. It is the most sonorous and muscular, while it is among the most elegant and most flexible of idioms; and it is not strange that, throughout the Moslem and Hindu realm, it should have become the court language, and that of the educated world in general; holding a position somewhat similar to that which the French language held till a recent period in Europe. Its chief characteristic, however, is the enormous intermixture of Arabic words, which, indeed, make almost half its vocabulary. Re specting its analytical and grammatical structure, it exhibits traces only of that of the ancient dialects of Zend and Achæmenian, of which it is a direct descendant.\n",
      "T, n. The grammar of the Persian language has been called 'regular;' but the fact is, that there is hardly any grammar worth mentioning-at all events, no grammar whose rules could not be mastered in a very short time. To begin with: there is no gender distinguished in declension; the plural is always formed in the same manner, the only distinction consisting in animate beings receiving the affix ân, while the inanimate are terminated in hâ; further, that instead of the inflection in the different cases, found in the ancient languages, either a mar (hitherto unexplained) is prefixed, or a rå (râh=way, by reason of-Pahlavi, Parsi) is affixed. Between the genitive and the word which governs it, also between a noun and its following adjective, an i is inserted. This is the whole declension, not only of the noun, but also of the adjective and pronoun. The comparative is formed, as in the mothertongues, by the addition of ter; the superlative adds terin, which is New-Persian exclusively. Not even the pronouns have a gender of their own; the distinction between masculine and feminine must be expressed by a special word, denoting male or female. There is no article, either definite or indefinite. Singularity of a noun is expressed by an appended ê, remnant of aêva, one. The flection of the verb is equally simple. There is a set of personal terminations for all tenses-am, i, ad or ast; êm, êd, nd; the infinitive ends in tan or dan, the past participle in tah or dah. The aorist is formed by adding to the root the terminations am, i, ad; em, ed, and; the preterite by dropping the n of the infinitive, and substituting the usual terminations. The prefix mi or hami (Parsi and Huzvaresh = always) transforms the preterite into the imperfect; while the prefix bi or bih (the present of the verb 'to will') alters the aorist into the simple future. The other tenses are compounds of the past participle and auxiliary verbs, as in the Teutonic and other modern tongues. The passive is formed by the various tenses of the verb shudan, 'to be, to go, to beware,' being placed after the past participle.\n",

      "The literary period now under consideration is distinguishable by the above-mentioned infusion of Arabic words into the Persian language, imported together with the Koran and its teachings. The writers are, in fact, one and all, Mohammedans. With the fanaticism peculiar to conquering religions, particularly to Islam, all the representatives of old Persian literature and science, men and matter, were ruthlessly persecuted by Omar's general, Saad Ibn Abi Wakkas. The consequence was, that, for the first two or three centuries after the conquest, all was silence. The scholars and priests who would not bow to Allah and his Prophet and to the new order of things, and who had found means to emigrate, took with them what had not been destroyed of the written monuments of their ancient culture; while those that remained at home were forced to abandon their wonted studies. Yet, by slow degrees, as is invariably the case under such circumstances, the conquered race transformed the culture of the conquerors to such a degree, that native influence soon became paramount in Persia, even in theology-the supreme science. It is readily granted by later Mohammedan writers, that out of the body of the Persians exclusively sprang the foremost scholars, if not all the greatest scholars and authors, on religious as well as grammatical subjects, historians and poets, philosophers and men of science; and the only concession that they made consisted in their use of the newly imported Arabic tongue.

The necessity of attending to the principles of P. in all pictorial drawing is apparent when we consider, e.g., that a circle, seen obliquely, appears to be not a circle, but an ellipse, with its shortest diameter in line with the spectator, and its longest at right angles to this. A square, seen from a position opposite the centre of one of its sides, appears as a trapezoid, the sides which are perpendicular to the direction of vision appearing to be parallel, while the other two appear to converge to a point in front of the spectator, etc. For the same reason, two rows of parallel pillars of equal height, seen from a point between and equidistant from each row, appear not only to converge at the further end, but to become gradually smaller and smaller.

After the scope (i.e., the number of objects to be introduced, and the distance at which they are to be viewed) of the picture has been determined, and before the design is commenced, it is necessary to draw upon the P. plan three lines: 1.

All lines which in nature are perpendicular to the ground-line, or to a vertical plane raised upon it as a base, meet in the point of sight, which is thus their vanishing point (see the line of the tops and bottoms of the pillars in fig. 1). ure.\n",

      "those cases where the lines, of which the points of distance are the vanishing points, are inclined (in nature) at an angle of 45° to the base-line; but, in all cases, the two points of distance are about twice as far apart as the eye is from the picture. One important use of the points of distance is to define the distance of objects in a row (fig. 1) from each other. For this purpose, two points of distance are not necessary, as, when the position of one pillar is found, that of the one opposite is 'at once obtained by drawing a line parallel to the base or ground-line. We have seen that the point of sight is the vanishing point of all level lines which meet the ground line or a vertical plane on it at right angles, and that the points of distance (in a direct picture) are the vanishing points of all lines which cut the groundline at an angle of 45°; but there are many other groups of parallel lines in a picture which have different situations, and therefore different vanishing points. Such lines with their vanishing points (called, for distinction's sake, accidental points) are represented in fig. 2. If the accidental point is above the horizontal line, it is called the accidental point aerial—if below, the accidental point terrestrial; and a little consideration makes it evident that these points may or may not be situated within the plane of the picture. Such are the points and lines necessary for the construction of a plan in true P.; and from the above explanation, we may deduce the two general principles: 1, That all parallel straight lines in nature are no longer parallel when projected on the P. plane, but meet in a point which is called the vanishing point, and is some one of the three above described, unless these lines happen to be also parallel to the ground-line or the vertical line, in which case they re- Fig. 2.\n",

As the distance of objects increases, their illuminated parts are made less brilliant, and their shaded parts more feeble.

      "PERTURBATIONS OF THE PLANETS: deviations of the planets from their regular elliptic courses; produced in the motion of one heavenly body about another, by the action of a third body, or by the non-sphericity of the principal body. Thus, e.g., were there no bodies in space except the earth and moon, the moon would describe accurately an ellipse about the earth's centre as focus, and its radius vector would pass over equal areas in equal times-but only if both bodies were homogeneous and truly spherical, or had their constituent matter otherwise so arranged as to attract each other as if each were collected at some definite point of its mass. The oblateness of the earth's figure, therefore, produces P. in what would otherwise be the fixed elliptic orbit of the moon. Again, when we consider the sun's action, it is obvious that in no position of the moon can the sun act equally on both earth and moon; for at new moon, the moon is nearer to the sun than the earth is, and is therefore more attracted (in proportion to its mass) than the earth-that is, the difference of the sun's actions on the earth and moon is equivalent to a force tending to draw the moon away from the earth. At full moon, on the other hand, the earth (in proportion to its mass) is more attracted than the moon is by the sun; and the perturbing influence of the sun is again of the nature of a force tending to separate the earth and moon. About the quarters, on the other hand, the sun's attraction (mass for mass) is nearly the same in amount on the earth and moon, but the direction of its action is not the same on the two bodies, and it is easy to see that in this case the perturbing force tends to bring the earth and moon nearer to each other. For any given position of the moon, with reference to the earth and sun, the difference of the accelerating effects of the sun on the earth and moon is a disturbing force; and it is to this that the P. of the moon's orbit, which are the most important, and among the most considerable, in the solar system, are due. [By the word difference is understood, not the arithmetical difference, but the resultant of the sun's direct acceleration of the moon, combined with that of the earth reversed in direction and magnitude; as it is only with the relative motions of the earth and moon that the calculation is concerned.] This disturbing force may be resolved into three components-e.g., we may have one in the line joining the earth and moon, another parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, and perpendicular to the moon's\n",

The first component, as noted above, tends to separate the earth and moon at new and full, and to bring them closer at the quarters; but during a whole revolution of the moon, the latter tendency is more than neutralized by the former-that is, in consequence of the sun's disturbing force, the moon is virtually less attracted by the earth than it would have been had the sun been absent. The second component tends mainly to accelerate the moon's motion in parts of its orbit, and to retard it at others. The third component tends, on the whole, to draw the moon toward the plane of the ecliptic.

But it may be considered to be an ellipse which is undergoing slow modifications in form, position, and dimensions, by the agency of the disturbing forces. In fact, it is obvious that any small are of the actual orbit is a portion of the elliptic orbit which the body would pursue forever afterward if the disturbing forces were suddenly to cease as it moved in that are. The parameters, then, are the elements of the orbit-that is, its major axis, eccentricity, longitude of apse, longitude of node, inclination to the ecliptic, and epoch; the latter quantity indicating the time at which the body passed through a particular point, as the apse, of its orbit. If these be given, the orbit is completely known, with the body's position in it at any given instant. If there be no disturbing forces, all these quantities are constant; therefore, when the disturbing forces are taken into account, they change very slowly, as the disturbing forces are, in most cases, very small. To give an instance of the nature of their changes, let us briefly consider one or two simple cases.\n",

      "the other hand, the tendency is to make the apse progrede. Also, as the velocity is scarcely altered by such a force, the major axis remains unaltered. Thus at M the eccentricity is diminished, and at M, increased, since the apsidal distance is increased at M, and diminished at M₁. Mg Fig. 1. Here\n",
      "Next, consider a tangential accelerating force. the immediate effect is to increase the velocity at any point of the orbit, therefore to make it correspond to a larger orbit, consequently to a longer periodic time.\n",
      "Conversely, a retarding force, such as the resistance of a medium, diminishes the velocity at each point, and thus makes the motion correspond to that in an ellipse with a less major axis, and therefore with a diminished periodic time. This singular result, that the periodic time of a body is diminished by resistance, is realized in the case of Encke's comet; and this observed effect furnishes one of the most convincing proofs of the existence of a resisting medium in interplanetary space.\n",
      "Again, the effect of a disturbing force continually directed toward the plane of the ecliptic is to make the node regrede. Thus, if NN represent the ecliptic, NM a portion of the orbit, the tendency of the disturbing force at M is to make MQ the new orbit, and therefore N' the node. Thus the node regredes, and the inclination of the orbit to the ecliptic is diminished, when the planet has just passed the ascending node. In Figure 3, let\n",
      "M, be a position of the planet near the descending node N. The effect of the disturbing force is to alter the orbit to MN,'. Thus, again, the node regredes, but the inclination is increased.

The city of Cuzco, in a region of rare beauty, and with a temperate climate, is 11,380 ft. above sea-level, or 2,000 ft. higher than the great St. Bernard. The climate of the Sierra, however, is not always so charming. In general terms, it may be described as mild and variable, with moderate rains. In the district of Paucartambo, rain falls 300 days in the year. A country, however, of such uneven surface, of snow-covered peaks and tropical valleys, embraces every variety of climate. In all the lower regions of the country the climate is warm, but healthful; in the uplands, and on the highest plateaux, it is often inclement.\n",

It consists of vast, impenetrable forests and alluvial plains, is rich in all the productions of tropical latitudes, is of inexhaustible fertility, and teems with animal and vegetable life. It is still, however, almost wholly unproductive to man. The silence of its central forests has never been disturbed by the civilized explorer, and its only human inhabitants are a few scattered tribes of Indians.\n",
      "T, n. Along the head-waters of the Purus, which, flowing through beautiful forest-covered plains, approaches within 60 m. of Cuzco, there were formerly numerous Spanish farms, where great tracts of forests had been cleared, and where crops of coca, cocoa, sugar, and other tropical productions, were regularly raised. These farms have, since 1861, been abandoned, and the encroaching forest has already obliterated their sites. The upper waters of the Purus are the headquarters of a savage and barbarously cruel tribe of wild Indians, called Chunchos. These untamable savages have shown the greatest hostility to the advance of civilization. They murdered the settlers, or drove them to take refuge in some less advanced settlement. When Markham visited this region 1853, a few farms remained; in a paper, however, which he communicated to the Journal of the Royal Geographical Soc., dated 1861, he further reported that the Chunchos have finished their barbarous work, for the settlers have either all been massacred or driven back from the forest, so that now not a single settlement remains. The rich valleys of Paucartambo, once covered with flourishing Spanish farms, have again become one vast tropical forest. The virgin soil of the Montaña is of amazing fertility; and its climate, not oppressively hot, is healthful. The forests consist of huge trees, of which some are remarkable for beauty of their wood, others for valuable gums and resins, others as timber-trees. A rank undergrowth of vegetation covers the country, and the trees are often chained together and festooned with parasites and closely matted creepers. In this region, mostly undisturbed by the voice of man, civilized or savage, animal life flourishes in endless variety, and birds of the brightest plumage flit among the foliage. Among the products yielded here in spontaneous abundance are the inestimable Peruvian bark (see CINCHONA), India-rubber, gum copal, vanilla, indigo, copaiba, balsam, cinnamon, sarsaparilla, ipecacuanha, vegetable wax, etc. On the w. fringe of the Montaña, where there are still a few settlements, tobacco, sugar, coffee, cotton, and chocolate are cultivated with complete success.\n",

The foreign debt then amounted to $160,000,000, and the internal to $100,000,000, both with interest long defaulted. Chili was made a party to the contract, and signed a protocol, under which she agreed to restore the Lobos Islands to P. and to return 80 per cent. of the proceeds of the sales of guano since 1882, Feb. Under the joint contract, P. was released from responsibility for the loans of 1869, 70, and 72, nearly all of which was incurred in railroad construction; and the syndicate took possession of the roads for 66 years, agreeing to complete and operate them and return them to P. at the end of that period. The various roads aggregated about 769 m. The govt. ceded the syndicate, with the consent of Chili, the guano beds at Tarapaca, Huanillos, Pabellon de Ica, Punta de Lobos, and wherever else guano may be found, to the extent of 3,000,000 tons, reserving for home consumption the beds of the Chincha Islands. If the syndicate fail to find the specified amount of guano, P. is not responsible; but as soon as the amount is found, all the beds are to be restored to the govt.

      "PESSIMISM, n. pěs´si-mizm [F. pessimisme-from L. pessimus, worst]: doctrine that the world is the worst possible world; doctrine that the universe by its inherent law tends toward the non-existence whence it sprang: disposition to look on the worst side of everything; opposite of optimism. PESSIMIST, -mist, one who holds the theories, or exercises the disposition, of pessimism.-Pessimism is popularly a melancholy or severely critical view of the world and its affairs; philosophically, the doctrine that this world is the worst possible, or altogether evil. It is the antithesis of OPTIMISM [L. optimus, best], which is an unthinking genial view of life, or an unquestioning dismissal of its problems with the assumption that whatever is, is right;' or else, more doctrinally and more reasonably, the conclusion that Infinite wisdom and goodness underlie all the perplexities of existence. Between the two positive extremes is a vague provisional medium, MELIORISM [L. melior, better] (named by George Eliot'), a hopeful belief that, though the struggle of existence has thus far been full of suffering and waste, there is a tendency to something better. P. has been brought out as a philosophical system, since 1819, in the works of Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann; but the problem of evil, natural and moral, has given a tinge of P. to ancient writings and systems, appearing, e.g., in the discussions in the Book of Job, in the record by Solomon of his apostasy as given in the Book of Ecclesiastes; and, egoistically, in the motto of epicureanism, 'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' Extremes meet; and asceticism in all its forms, in all ages, only draws an opposite inference from the same premises: life is vanity, therefore let us abstain from enjoyments. Brahminism and its offshoot, Buddhism, alike regard the changeful world as one only of sorrow, and existence as vain and evil. Buddhism finds the cause of evil to be in desire, which, together with all thought, may be annihilated by repression and self-mortification, until a practical death in life is attained, the Nirvána, which is perfected at bodily death. Unlike this, the asceticism that grew out of the reasonable self-denial inculcated by Christianity, and its antagonism to worldliness, had in view the blessedness of loving and obeying God, and the purification of the human spirit for a higher life. And while Christianity admits that the whole creation travaileth together until now,' it is waiting for a glorious redemption. The philosophical P. of Schopenhauer was connected with German philosophies that sought the primary principle of being, and made it attain to consciousness only in man. This he affirmed to be Will, instead of reason or thought; but, in a peculiar sense, a craving toward life and objective existence, without aim. This developed the brain, as one among other things that feed desire; but brain develops at last a rational intelligence that emancipates man from the craving and suffering which sum up nature. We find a\n",
      "PEST-PESTÁLOZZI momentary rest in the non-utilitarian and hence unselfish enjoyment of art ideals. The only permanent beatitude begins when one gives up the will to life in its lower sense-that is, in the order of nature, where no true happiness is possible; and renouncing egoism, even the very principle of individuality, identifies himself with the good and the suffering of every creature, cultivates active love to others, and, above all, keeps the vow of chastity. This is the religion adopted by Tolstoï, with a Christian acknowledgment and coloring; and, except in its atheistic premises, its denial of individual immortality, and a self-denial running to extreme asceticism, it has a Christian likeness. It is the higher rational and spiritual life, versus the lower life of subjection to sense, where no happiness is; it even ignores happiness as the true aim of life. Schopenhauer excited little attention before about 1865; meanwhile another form of P. had its day-the cynicism or the plaintive sentimentality of the romantic school. Later, the first effect of Darwinism was unfavorable to theism; indeed, without a theistic interpretation, the struggle of existence' and the animal side of man offer nothing but a pessimistic view.

      "history presents occasional examples. All France, especially, was stirred from its depths; and just at the time when the enthusiasm of that country had been already kindled to its full fervor, it received sacredness and authority from the decree of a council at Clermont, in which Urban himself was present, and in which his celebrated harangue was the signal for the outpouring, through all western Christendom, of the same chivalrous emotions by which France had been borne away under the rude eloquence of the Hermit. For the details of the expedition, see CRUSADES: our present concern is with P.'s personal history. Of the enormous but undisciplined army which assembled from all parts of Europe, one portion was committed to his conduct; the other being under the command of a far more skilful leader, Walter the Pennyless. P. placed himself at their head, mounted on his ass, with his coarse woolen mantle and his rude sandals. On the march through Hungary, they became involved in hostilities with the Hungarians, and suffered a severe defeat at Semlin, whence they proceeded with much difficulty to Constantinople. There Emperor Alexis, filled with disinȧy at the want of discipline which they showed, was but too happy to give them supplies for their onward march; and near Nice, they encountered the army of the Sultan Solyman, from whom they suffered a terrible defeat. P. accompanied the subsequent expedition under Godfrey; but worn out by the delays and difficulties of the siege of Antioch, he was about to withdraw from the expedition, and was retained in it only by the influence of the other leaders, who foresaw the worst results from his departure. Accordingly, he had a share, though not marked by any signal distinction, in the siege and capture of the Holy City 1099; and the closing incident of his history as a crusader was an address to the victorious army delivered on the Mount of Olives. He returned to Europe, and founded at Huy a monastery, in which he died.\n",

The poet seems to have rendered homage to her not so much as a personal woman, but as his chosen personification of womanhood in the abstract. He met her 1327, Apr. 6, in the Church of St. Clara in Avignon, and at once and forever fell deeply in love with her. The lady (if we accept the traditions) was then of the age of 19, daughter of Audibert de Noves, and had been married two years to a gentleman of Avignon, named Hugues de Sade. For ten years, P. lived near her in the papal city, and frequently met her at church, in society, at festivities, etc. He sang her beauty and his love in those sonnets, whose mellifluous conceits ravished the ears of his contemporaries, and still hold an unfading charm.\n",
      "Laura was not insensible to a worship which made an emperor (Charles IV.) beg to be introduced to her, and to be allowed to kiss her forehead; but she seems to have kept the too ardent poet at proper distance. In\n",
      "1338 P. withdrew from Avignon to the romantic valley of Vaucluse, where he lived some years, spending his time almost solely in literary pursuits. A most brilliant honor awaited him at Rome, 1341, where, on Easter Day, he was crowned in the capitol with the laurel-wreath of the poet. The ceremonies which marked this coronation were a grotesque medley of pagan and Christian representations. P. was, however, as ardent a scholar as he was a poet; and throughout his whole life, he was occupied in the collection of Latin MSS., even copying some with his own hand. To obtain these, he travelled frequently throughout France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\n",
      "H, n. The principal are his Epistolæ, consisting of letters to his numerous friends and acquaintances, and which rank as the best of his prose works; De Vitis Virorum Illustrium;\n",
      "De Remediis utriusque Fortunæ; De Vita Solitaria; Rerum Memorandarum Libri IV.; De Contemptu Mundi, etc. Besides his prose-epistles, P. wrote numerous epistles in Latin verse, eclogues, and an epic poem, Africa, on the subject of the second Punic war; and it was this production which obtained for him the laurel-wreath at Rome. P. showed little solicitude about the fate of his beautiful Italian verse, but built his hope of his name being remembered on his Latin poems, which, it has been said, are now remembered only because of his name.\n",
      "In 1853 he finally left Avignon, and passed the remainder of his life in Italy-partly at Milan, where he spent nearly ten years, partly at Parma, Mantua, Padua, Verona,\n",

      "however, more than a mere evaporation. The hydrocarbons of high carbon percentage have a tendency, on exposure to heat, to split up into those of lower boilingpoint, or, what is the same thing, of lower carbon percentage. This process is termed 'cracking.' As the object of the refiner is to produce a medium grade of oil, he endeavors to secure a larger quantity by decomposing the heavier products by this method. The stills generally are sheet-iron, sometimes cast-iron, tanks, in which the oil is heated. As the lighter products evaporate, they are collected and separated for use in the manufacture of water-gas and naphtha-gas, for gas machines, for cleansing processes, etc. As the intermediate portions come over, they are condensed and separated as kerosene oil. The heavier products are used for lubricating oils and other purposes. 'Cracking' is brought about by making the still high, so as to keep the gasified hydrocarbons a long time in the hot body of the apparatus, and by introducing superheated steam at the proper period.\n",
      "To make the kerosene colorless, bleaching is required.\n",

When Epaminondas organized the Theban army against Sparta, he felt that the Spartan line of battle would be impregnable to troops organized in their own manner. He therefore increased the depth and lessened the front of his P., which enabled him to burst through the Spartan line, inflicting the sanguinary defeat of Leuctra, B.C. 371.

Its origin has given rise to much speculation, but no certainty has been reached by investigators.

The common myth concerning it was the story of some god deprived of his powers of generation -an allusion to the sun, which in autumn loses its fructifying influence. The procession in which it was carried about was called Phallagogia, or Periphallia, and a certain hymn was sung on that occasion, called the Phallikon Melos. The bearers of the phallus, which generally consisted of red leather, and was attached to an enormous pole, were the Phallophoroi.

The superior planets, to a certain extent, exhibit phases, but the luminous surface, as seen from the earth, only varies from the full illumination seen when they are in conjunction with the earth to a slightly gibbous appearance when they attain their greatest elongation; and their distance from the sun is so great in comparison with that of the earth, as to render the variation in the form of their luminous surface not observable, except in the case of Mars and occasionally of Jupiter. Galileo was the first to observe the phases of Venus, and he considered them one of the most satisfactory proofs of the Copernican system. The great brilliancy of Mercury, and its nearness to the sun, prevented its phases from being so easily noticed; but they were at last observed by Masius, and have been observed since by many other astronomers. The term phases is frequently applied to designate the successive stages of an eclipse, lunar or solar.\n",

Very young pheasants must be carefully supplied with ants' eggs, maggots, etc., and the whole difficulty of rearing them is in their earliest stage. Pheasants feed indiscriminately on berries, seeds, roots, young shoots of plants, worms, insects, etc. Beans, peas, corn, and buckwheat are frequently thrown for them in open places in woods; and they scrape up bulbous and tuberous roots in winter. They roost in trees at no great height from the ground, and poachers sometimes capture them by burning sulphur below them. During the moulting season, they do not ascend trees to roost, but spend the night on the ground, when they fall a ready prey to foxes.\n",

The males and females do not associate together except during the breeding season, but small numbers of one sex are often found in company. The short crow' of the males begins to be heard in March. In England and Scotland, pheasantshooting legally begins Oct. 1, and ends Feb. 3. The pheasants turned out from the gamekeeper's breedingyard into a preserve are in general supplied with abundance of food during winter, and come to the accustomed call as readily as any kind of poultry, so that the sportsmanship of a battue, in which they are killed by scores or hundreds, is of the lowest kind.

This accusation he repelled by taking off the robe and weighing it. He was then accused of impiety, for having introduced his own likeness and that of Pericles on the shield of the goddess. On this mos frivolous and contemptible pretext he was thrown into prison, and died there, but whether of sickness or poison is uncertain.

Catholicism, in which he was surpassed by no man who ever lived, and the zeal with which he persecuted all heretics through the Inquisition, combined with the odious tyranny of his secular government to degrade Spain, by breaking the proud and chivalrous spirit which had been the source of its pre-eminence among European nations; while his virulent persecutions of the industrious Moriscoes, and his oppressive exactions, put a stop to the commerce of the country.

The P. are of the latter class; and they not only themselves refuse all priestly ministrations, but they regard all such ministrations-baptism, marriage, sacraments—as invalid; and they rebaptize all who join their sect from other Russian communities. All their own ministerial offices are discharged by the Starik, or parish elder, who for the time takes the title of pope, and is required to observe celibacy. Among the P. fanaticism at times has run to the wildest excesses. They refuse oaths, and decline to enter military service; and having, on account of this, and many other incompatibilities of the system with the Russian practice, encountered much persecution, they resolved to emigrate.

But supposing that the Casluhim were some separate tribe, and yet Caphtorian colonists, the question remains, whether Caphtor can be identified with Cappadocia in Asia Minor, as the early versions (LXX., Targ., Pesh., Vulg.) have it; or whether it be Pelusium, Cyprus, or the Isle of Crete. The latter opinion seems not the least probable. At what time they first immigrated, and drove out the Canaanitish inhabitants, the Avvim, is difficult to conjecture.

      "Of P., even in its widest sense, the study of language was always, and necessarily, a fundamental part; and, in the usual sense of the word, it has been the chief part -often nearly the whole. For a long time after the revival of learning, the classic writers were studied chiefly for their language and style, and those of them that did not meet an imaginary standard of purity were despised and neglected, however valuable they might be for their matter. But though great and even undue attention was thus given to language, it was only as an instrument, as means to an end. The philologist studied a language in order to be able to understand it and use it-to get at the thoughts conveyed in it, or to convey his own thoughts with force and elegance to others.\n",
      "This is the object of the grammars, dictionaries, annotated editions, and criticisms, which constitute the chief part of philological literature. But within recent years, P. has entered on a new phase, or rather a new field of study has been added to the old. As the naturalist investigates a class of objects not with a view to turn them to use, but to understand their nature, and classify them, so the modern school of philologists examine and compare the structures of the various languages, and arrange them in classes and families, with the ultimate view of arriving at some theory of language in general-its mode of origin and growth. The comparison of the structure of two or more languages is called Comparative Grammar, and the whole of this new branch of study is sometimes designated Comparative P.; but it seems better to leave the old field in possession of the old name, and in distinction from P., as the practical knowledge of languages, to speak of the study of language as a phenomenon per se, as the Science of Language.

Leibnitz was the first to set aside this notion, and to establish the principle that the study of languages must be conducted in the same way as that of the exact sciences, by first collecting as many facts as possible, and then proceeding by inductive reasoning.

It follows from this that the 'genealog cial 'classification, as it is called, cannot be carried out with great surety or rigor except in the case of languages in which grammatical forms had become in some degree fixed before their divergence-i.e., except in the case of the inflectional languages.

At the foundation of all worls lie Roots (q.v.), or simple sounds expressive of ning. Now, some languages, e.g., the Chinese (q.v.), as these roots in their naked form as words, the same syllable, according to its position, serving as noun, adjective, verb, etc.-e.g., ta means great, greatness, to be or to make great, greatly or very. The relational part of the thought mostly gets no vocal expression; it is only indicated by position, as when min, people, and li, power, are simply put together (min li) to signify the people's power. Relations not readily indicated by position are expressed in a round-about way by using additional significant words: thus, tschung (mass or multitude) jin (man) men; niu (woman) tse (child) = daughter; y min li (employ people power) = with the people's power.\n",
      "Even in such cases, each root preserves its independence, and is felt to express its own radical meaning. Languages like the Chinese, whose development has been arrested at this rudimentary stage, are called Monosyllabic or Isolating.\n",

In these, the relational part of thought obtains prominent vocal expression by separate roots joined or glued on to the significant roots as terminations. These terminations were originally themselves significant roots, and many of them are used still as separate significant words, though the greater part have sunk down to mere signs of cases and other relations. The compound expression thus formed never, however. attains perfect unity; the significant root always remains rigid, unobscured in its sense, and unchanged in form, and the termination is felt as something distinct from the body of the word.\n",

Thus, the root sev has the indefinite meaning of loving, and the inf. is sevmek, to love; which then, by the insertion of certain suffixes, can take on as many as 40 forms or voices-e.g., sev-me-mek, not to love; ser-e-me-mek, not to be able to love; sev-dir-mek, to cause to love; sev-dir-ish-mek, to cause one another to love; sev-il-mek, to be loved; sev-ile-me-mek, not to be able to be loved; etc. Each of these forms, then, runs through a large round of tenses and moods, with their persons and numbers.\n",

      "C, n. But though it may be fruitless to look for extensive identifications of the roots and grammatical forms of the Aryan tongues, even in the oldest forms to which we can trace them, with those of the Semitic, still more with Chinese or Turkish elements, it seems rash and unscientific to affirm that, going back to the radical stage, the development of all could not have begun from a common stock of monosyllabic roots. The wonderful transformations exhibited by language in the course of its known history seem sufficient ground for maintaining the possibility of origin in a common stock. On the other hand, the nature of the case forbids hope of ever being able to prove it; for the coincidences that occur (e.g., Chinese fu, Tibetan pha, Lat. and Gr. pa-ter, Eng. fa-ther; Chin. mu, Egyp. mu, Lat. and Gr. ma-ter, Eng. mo-ther) might arise from the mind and vocal organs of man being everywhere essentially the same.\n",

It has been established, e.g., by induction (see GRIMMS LAW), that c in Latin is regularly represented by h in Gothic and English; while for Gothic or English c, the corresponding letter in Latin is g.

      "ΟΝΟΜΑΤΟΡΕΙΑ. In the case of ideas unconnected with any natural sound, names would readily be suggested in many cases by analogies real or fancied with things that were attended by sounds. We can see, again, a physiological fitness in the articulation sta, to stand, with the idea of stability; with the attitude, the organs involuntarily assume the position with which this syllable is emitted. Similar instances might be multiplied. We are not to suppose that the same thing would suggest the same sound to all, or even to the same individual at all times. The language-making faculty in the flush of its spring would throw out a multitude of names for the same thing (synonyms), as well as apply the same name to many different things (homonyms); but by a process of natural elimination, those only would survive that were felt best to answer the purposes of speech. The abstracting faculty would also soon dissociate them from the concrete individual objects that first suggested them, and convert them into symbols of the prominent attributes of whole classes. It is these generalized names, syllables significant of such general simple notions as seeing, moving, running, shining, striking, cutting, or being sharp, that, by a kind of inverse process, became the roots of language as it now exists. A syllable expressive of single prominent attribute forms the foundation of the names of a whole class of objects, the specific differences being marked by other significant syllables joined on to it: see RooT. In some such way, by the unconscious working of man's intellectual nature, we may conceive language to have grown out of the exclamatory or interjectional stage into the rational structure that we now admire. This theory of the origin of roots, together with the constant operation of phonetic change, accounts for the absence of all traces of onomatopoeia in the great bulk of the words of a language, and seems to meet the objections of Max Müller and other philologists to the onomatopoeic theory.\n",
      "With regard to these primary or radical words it is necessary to observe here only that they all are significant of sensible or physical ideas, and that expressions for immaterial conceptions are derived from them by metaphor. For the growth, from a comparatively few roots of this kind, of the vocabulary of the richest language, see, further, RooT.\n",

      "PHLEBITIS, n. fle-bi'tis [Gr. phleps or phleba, a vein in animals]: inflammation of a vein. P., though seldom an original or idiopathic disease, is a frequent sequence of wounds, in which case it is termed traumatic phlebitis [from the Greek trauma, a wound], and is not uncom mon after delivery. The disease is indicated by great tenderness and pain along the course of the affected vessel, which feels like a hard knotted cord, and rolls under the fingers. The hardness is, however, sometimes obscured by the swelling of the limb beyond and about the seat of the disorder, partly in consequence of the effusion of serum caused by the obstruction to the return of the venous blood (which thus gives rise to a local dropsy)-\n",
      "PHLEBITIS.\n",
      "and partly in consequence of the propagation of the inflammation to the surrounding tissues. The inner surface of the inflamed vessel is supposed to throw out fibrinous fluid, which coagulates in layers, and finally closes the tube. If the vessel is small, the consequences of its obstruction may be of little importance; but when a large vein is affected, the consequences are always dangerous, and may be fatal. There are two modes of recovery: solution of the coagulated fibrine may take place, and the vessel may again become pervious; or, as is more frequent, the obstruction may continue, but a collateral venous circulation may be established, and the circulation thus carried on through a circuitous route.\n",
      "W: either abscesses are formed along the vein, or the pus passes into the current of blood and contaminates the circulation, giving rise to the perilous disease Pyamia (q.v.). Either condition is dangerous; the latter pre-eminently so.-P. originates usually in some local injury of a vein, and the inflammation, once established, is readily propagated along the course of the vessel. Sometimes very slight injuries give rise to it. It occurs sometimes after venesection, especially with a dull lancet, or one soiled by contact with diseased matter. Women are liable to this disease after delivery, as the veins of the womb are apt to become inflamed, and to communicate the inflammation to the venous trunks connected with them: see PHLEGMASIA. There is considerable difference of opinion as to the treatment-some high authorities (Dr. Wood, e.g.) recommending the very free use of leeches along the affected vein,' and that they should be repeated over and over again if the symptoms of inflammation should persevere,' the subsequent application of cold lotions, and the internal use of mercury 'pushed to a moderate salivation;' while others question the utility of such treatment, and recommend 'rest, warm fomentations and poultices, early incision of abscesses, evacuation of bile and fæces by one or two doses of calomel, opium to relieve pain and insure quiet of mind and body, and wine, especially if there has been great loss of blood.'-Druitt's\n",

      "MASIA ALBA DOLENS: disease most fre quent in women after parturition, especially if they have lost much blood, but occurring sometimes in unmarried women, and occasionally in men. Its usual beginning is a week or ten days after delivery, with a feeling of pain in the loins or lower part of the abdomen; whence it extends to the groin and down the thigh and leg. The pain soon becomes very severe, and follows principally the course of the internal cutaneous and crural nerve of the thigh and of the posterior tibial in the leg. The limb soon begins to swell, and in two days is sometimes twice its ordinary size; and as the swelling develops, the acuteness of the pain considerably diminishes. The limb is partly flexed, and lies motionless; any movement aggravates the pain. The swelling extends uniformly over the limb, which is pale and shining, and hot and firm to the touch, seldom pitting on pressure. The femoral vein may usually be felt like a hard cord, and this symptom, taken with the swelling, clearly indicates that this affection is essentially crural phlebitis. The uniformity of the cord is interrupted by nodules, arising either from inflamed cellular tissue, or from clots within the vein. Both legs are seldom attacked at the same time, and the left thigh is the most common seat of the disease.\n",
      "This affection usually terminates favorably, the acute symptoms disappearing in ten days or a fortnight. The swelling, however, often continues for a long time, sometimes through life. Very different opinions have been held regarding the nature of this disease. At one time it was considered as the result of metastatic secretion of milk (in other words, as due to the milk leaving the breast, and settling in the thigh; hence the term milk-leg). There is now no doubt that the disease in women is inflammation originating in the veins of the womb, and extending to the veins of the lower extremity.\n",

Warm poppy fomentations, or bran poultices sprinkled with laudanum, may be applied externally at the beginning of the attack, after which flannel saturated with a liniment, composed of one part of laudanum to two parts of soap liniment, may be applied round the limb in the form of a bandage, but not so tightly as to occasion pain.

According to modern views, based mainly on Lavoisier's experiments, in the formation of acids and of earths, the addition of oxygen takes place instead of the subtraction of phlogiston.

      "PHOCION: Athenian general, of unusual private virtues; b. about the end of B.C. 5th c. (Clinton, in Fasti Hellenici, gives the date B.C. 402); d. after B.C. 323. He was of humble origin, but appears to have studied under Plato, Xenocrates, and perhaps Diogenes also, from the last of whom he may have acquired his habit of caustic sarcasm. His keen and biting wit gave him popular force as a speaker, while injuring him as a politic manager of men. P. was the only orator whom Demosthenes feared. Though gruff in manner, he was kind at heart. P. attracted notice first in the great sea-fight at Naxos (B.C. 376), where he commanded a division of the Athenian fleet, and materially helped to secure the victory. Yet we scarcely hear of him again for more than 20 years; but B.C. 351, with Evagoras, he undertook the conquest of Cyprus for the Persian monarch, Artaxerxes III. (Ochus), and was completely successful. About the same time (the exact date is uncertain), he led an Athenian expedition into the island of Euboea, where Philip of Macedon was intriguing, and inflicted a severe defeat on that powerful sovereign at Tamynæ. B.C. 341, he was again successful in crushing the Macedonian party in Euboea and restoring the ascendency of Athens. Two years before this, he had achieved a similar result at Megara; and 340, when sent to the aid of the Byzantines against Philip, he acted with so much prudence and tact, and inspired the citizens with so much zeal and courage, that Philip was forced to abandon the siege, and even to evacuate the Chersonesus; while P. captured several of his ships and coast-garrisons, besides making havoc in the Macedonian territory.\n",

While the ancient scriptural monuments of the Hebrews-outwardly and inwardly-exhibit a rare unity of idiom and form, the ancient hallowed utterance becoming a type and model for later generations, the Phoenicians, on the other hand, not confined within the narrow limits of their home-country, but mixing freely with all nations of the earth, spreading their own colonies far and near, opened a wide field for the 'development' of their language, rather for its corruption, by its entering into alliance with Libyan in Africa, Sardinia, and Spain; and with Aramaic in n. Phoenicia, Cilicia, perhaps even in Cyprus. Thus it came to pass that the two languages, which originally may have been identical in old Canaan, became more and more widely divergent. To enter into a more detailed disquisition on this or other cognate points seems more hazardous now than it seemed only a very few years ago; for the more numerous our fragmentary discoveries in Phoenician literature are becoming of late, the more evident is it that we are only at the beginning of Phoenician philology.\n",

      "PHOENIX: mythical Egyptian bird, supposed by some to be a kind of plover, like the kibitz, depicted often with human arms, and called in hieroglyphs rekh, Others consider it the bennu, or nycticorax, a bird sacred to Osiris, and represented watching in the tamarisk over his coffin. The first of these representations has sometimes a star upon the head, supposed to indicate the astronomical period of its appearance. According to one account, it visited Egypt after the death of its father, and entered the shrine particularly dedicated to it at Heliopolis; and there buried its parent, putting the body into an egg or case made of myrrh, and then closing up the egg. Another account is, that the P., when about to die, made a nest for itself in Arabia, from which a new P. sprang of itself. This bird proceeded to Heliopolis, and there burned and buried its father. But the more popularly known version is, that the P. burned itself, and a new and young P. sprang from the ashes. A less received version is, that a worm crawled out of the body of the dead P., and became the future P. The P. was, according to the most authentic accounts, supposed to visit Egypt every 500 years; the precise period, however, was not known at Heliopolis, and was a subject of contention till its appearance. The connection of the Phoenix period with that of the Sothiac cycle appears to be generally received by chronologists, as well as the statement of Herrepollo, that it designated the soul and the inundation of the Nile.

      "All alphabetic writing is essentially phonetic. The invention of letters was the invention of phonetic writing, as distinguished from the older pictorial, or ideographic, writing. From a variety of causes, however, no language has ever been perfectly represented by its spelling, and with the lapse of time the divergence has continually increased, since the spoken words are constantly undergoing change, while the spelling tends to remain fixed.\n",
      "In English especially this divergence has been allowed to proceed to such an extreme that it is universally admitted to be a serious evil; and in recent times various schemes have been projected to remedy it. To these schemes of radically reformed spelling the term phonetic writing is now applied; and what follows represents the views and arguments of the promoters of the movement, and sketches its history.\n",
      "The earliest attempts at alphabetic writing were as strictly phonetic as the limited scheme of symbols allowed, or as the limited aim of writers required. The alphabets were confined almost exclusively to consonants; and the analysis of speech on which they were based was confined in each case to the language for which the alphabet was designed. When any old alphabet, therefore, came to be adopted for a new language or dialect, it would be found deficient in means for writing any sounds not used in the language for which the alphabet was originally intended. Unless, then, new symbols were added for the new sounds, these latter must have been represented by conventional combinations of letters; and at this point the writing would cease to be perfectly phonetic.\n",
      "The Sanskrit language furnishes convincing proof of the original phonetic character of alphabetic writing; for not only were words written exactly as they were sounded, but every change which a word underwent in utterance was consistently indicated by a change in the writing. Notwithstanding this fact, there is no lan quage in which the etymological and grammatical reations of words are more clearly exhibited or easily traced than in Sanskrit.

      "But instead of being extended, the Latin alphabet was reverentially accepted with all its imperfections; its deficiencies were supplemented by use of servile or silent letters, and by various orthographical expedients; thus our writing came to be irregular, difficult, and fluctuat ing. The great inconvenience, however, of representing by the same character the two sounds of U and V, led to the introduction of U as a new letter for the vowel sound, and to the limitation of V to the consonant sound; and the further ambiguity arising from the want of an appropriate sign for the sound of W led to the invention of that symbol, which, being formed by joining together two of the old V characters, was thence called 'double V'-pronounced, according to the old sound of V, 'double U.'

      "associations of orthography, argue as if the verbal cluster of letters in reality constituted the word. The dispute is thus, in effect, between letters and sounds: which are the signs-which are the thing signified?\n",
      "In phonetic writing, the eye would no doubt confound such words as know and no, see and sea, sighs and size, when written separately, as in a vocabulary; but it cannot be supposed that such words would present more ambiguity in contextual usage than they now do in utterance, subject to the same confusion to the ear. At present, we have, in fact, two languages-one purely phonic, addressed to the ear; and the other, in some degree etymological or historical, addressed to the eye.\n",
      "In this respect, we are in a position similar to the Chinese, with their classical ideographic language of literature, and their multitudinous vernacular dialects. To establish the assertion that the phonic word (the sound) written phonetically in a sentence would be less intelligible to the eye than the written word in its present form, it is incumbent on the opponents of phoneticism to show that the simple phonic word is now less intelligible when pronounced in a sentence than its written symbol is when read in a sentence.\n",
      "The principal objection urged against phonetic writing is, that it would obscure the etymological history now discoverable in the orthography of a word. The best answer to this objection is, that the traces of etymology, preserved in the present spelling, are so imperfect and inconsistent as to be of little value compared with the embarrassments that they occasion in other respects. Further, they can be shown to be at times even misleading as to etymology.\n",
      "The first requisite for construction of a phonetic alphabet is an exact knowledge of elementary sounds, that every element may be provided with its appropriate symbol, and that no more symbols may be introduced than there are distinct elementary sounds. The latter consideration would be of importance only in connection with a general alphabet available for all languages.\n",

A. for English, in which new symbols were introduced for the vowels heard in the words on and up, and the four consonants heard in the words she, they, and thing.

In this scheme of phonotypes, diphthongal and articulate compounds were not analyzed, and the letters of the ordinary alphabet were retained in their most common signification, 17 new characters being introduced for unrepresented or ambiguously written sounds. The forms of these were, in most cases, happily suggestive of the displaced orthography, and the general aspect of the writing bore such a resemblance to common typography, that any good reader of the latter could decipher the new printing with ease, after very brief study of the alphabet.\n",
      "The ordinary vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U) were pronounced as in the words am, ell, ill, on, up; the consonants C and G were sounded as in came and game; the letters K, Q, X, were rejected as superfluous, and all the other letters of the common alphabet were retained, with their established sounds. Comparing this scheme of letters with the tabulated elementary sounds of English, we find that it represents all the vowels, except the nice varieties heard in the words air, ore, err, ask; and that all the consonants are accurately represented except wh.

The writing is, besides, overladen with diacritical points. In the alphabet of Prof. Max Müller, the latter difficulty is obviated by a free use of compound letters. The Lectures on the Science of Language by this author may be consulted with great advantage, both as to the physiology of speech and as to the history of words. In the second series of these Lectures are given diagrams of the organic formation of many of the elements of speech, as well as a comparative table of four alphabets that have been used in the transcription of Sanskrit, and numerous references to the works of continental and other writers who have treated of the science of phonetics.\n",

The chief difficulty in construction of a universal alphabet has arisen from lack of a complete classification of elementary sounds; another difficulty has been created by adherence to the inadequate letters of the Roman alphabet. The resolutions of the alphabetic conference were decidedly in favor of Roman letters as the basis of the proposed 'standard' alphabet. But the wisdom of this decision is questionable. No existing alphabet exhibits the natural relations of the sounds that it represents; consequently, though an alphabet physiologically complete were framed, it could not incorporate Roman, Greek, or any other letters at present in use, without sacrificing the most essential qualities of a universal alphabet-simplicity and congruity. Symbols must be devised which would indicate to the eye all the organic relations discoverable by the ear between the various elements, and which would be free from the associations that would attach to adopted letters familiar to the eye with other meanings.

As originally made, the instrument consisted of three parts-the sender, the receiver or recorder, and the transcriber. The sender consisted of a tube, having an open mouthpiece at one end, and bearing at the other end a thin diaphragm of metal or other substance, with a sharp point or style affixed to the centre of its outer surface. The second apparatus consisted of a cylinder, about four inches in diameter, having on its periphery a V-shaped groove cut spirally from end to end. Over this grooved cylinder a sheet of tinfoil was placed, and the sender advanced till the point of the style lightly touched the tinfoil, over the opening of the V-shaped cut. While the words to be recorded were spoken or sung, the cylinder was turned rapidly, the apparatus for moving it giving a lateral as well as a circular motion. The point of the style thus traversed the tinfoil spirally from end to end, and the vibrations in the diaphragm caused by the sounds resulted in a series of indentations in the tinfoil. To reproduce the sounds, the cylinder was again presented to a style attached to a diaphragm, the style being pressed against the tinfof by a slight spring. The cylinder was then made to re\n",

The The modern phonograph has been introduced as a practical instrument. It differs from the original in many respects. The rotation of the cylinder is automatically governed, and is effected either by foot-power, water-power, or by an electric motor driven from the lighting circuit, or by storage or primary battery. The recording cylinder is hollow, and made of a secret composition resembling wax. It is about 2 inches in diameter, and 4 inches long. The diaphragm, used both for recording and reproducing, is of thin glass. The two styles connected to its centre are of sapphire.

      "PHOSPHATES: compounds of phos phoric acid with a base; of which the following have an active part in the chemistry of the animal body. For the means of distinguishing between the salts of tribasic, bibasic, and monobasic phosphoric acids, see РHOS- PHORUS.\n",
      "Phosphate of Soda may occur under any one of the three forms 3Na₂OP,05, or 2Na,OH₂O·P₂O,, or Na₂O 2H₂O P₂05. All these salts are soluble in water; and the first two have an alkaline reaction, while the third is acid. By exposure of the second of these salts (2Na₂O H₂O P205) to a red heat, it is converted into what is termed pyrophosphate of soda (2Na₂OP₂O), in which the phosphoric acid is obviously no longer tribasic, but bibasic; and by similarly treating the third of these salts (Na,O 2H₂O·Р₂O), we convert it into the so-called metaphosphate of soda (Na,OP₂O), in which the phosphoric acid is monobasic. It is in consequence of these changes, under the action of heat, that the terms pyrophosphoric and metaphosphoric have been used as synonyms for bibasic and monobasic phosphoric acids. Phosphate of soda, in one or other of the above forms, occurs as a constituent of all the animal fluids and soft tissues of the body, but is abundant especially in the urine and the bile. There are reasons for believing that it is the second and third of these salts which occur as constituents of the animal body, though the first may possibly sometimes be found. Pyrophosphate and metaphosphate of soda are often found in the ashes of animal fluids or tissues after the process of incineration, but they result merely from the action of heat on the two other salts. The following remarks on the derivation, elimination, and physiological importance of the phosphates of soda, are applicable equally to the corresponding salts of potash always associated with them. The phosphates of the alkalies, which occur in the animal body, obviously owe their origin, either directly or indirectly, to the food-viz., directly, by being ingested as phosphates of the alkalies; or indirectly (within the system), by the action of phosphate of lime on salts of the alkalies. The elimination of these salts from the system\n",

In the carnivorous animals, whose blood is much richer in phosphates than that of herbivora (the ash of the blood of the dog, e.g., contains 12 to 14 per cent. of phosphoric acid; while that of the ox or sheep does not contain more than from 4 to 6), these salts are carried off by the urine; but in consequence of the formation of free acids as products of disintegration of the tissues, a portion of the base is abstracted from the originally alkaline phosphates, and à corresponding portion of phosphoric acid is liberated.\n",

      "I, a. Although the general distribution of the phosphates of the alkalies in the nutrient fluids (there is 40 per cent. of them in the ash of the blood-cells; 28:4 per cent. of phosphoric acid and 235 of potash in the ash of cows' milk; and about 70 per cent. of phosphoric acid in the ash of the yolk of egg) is in itself an indication of their importance, the exact nature of their functions is not understood. Liebig has specially drawn attention to the peculiar grouping of the acid and alkaline fluids of the animal body. The permanence of this grouping is maintained, especially in herbivorous animals, chiefly by the conversion, within the body, of alkaline and neutral phosphates into acid phosphates by the means above described. Moreover, all tissue-forming substances (the protein bodies) are so closely connected with phosphates, that they remain associated during the solution and subsequent re-precipitation of these substances; and the ash of developed tissues (e.g., muscle, lung, liver, etc.) always affords evidence that acid phosphates existed in the recent tissue; and, further, no exudation from the blood-vessels can undergo transformation into cells and fibres, i.e., become organized, unless, in addition to other conditions, phosphates are present. Another convincing proof of the share taken by the phosphates in the formation and functions of the tissue is the fact that, though herbivorous animals take up a very small quantity of phosphates in their food, and though their blood is very poor in these salts, their tissues contain as large a proportion of phosphates as the corresponding parts of Carnivora. Lastly, the fact that one equivalent of the alkaline phosphate of soda (2Na,O H₂OP,O) possesses the property of absorbing as much carbonic acid as two equivalents of carbonate of soda leads to the belief that the power of attracting carbonic acid, which the serum of the blood possesses, is due at least as much to the phosphate as to the carbonate of soda; and that, consequently, phosphate of soda has an important part in the respiratory process.\n",
      "Phosphate of Lime occurs in the organism in two formsviz., as the neutral or basic phosphate, 3CaO·P₂05, and the acid phosphate, 2CaO HO PO.

      "Of P., even in its widest sense, the study of language was always, and necessarily, a fundamental part; and, in the usual sense of the word, it has been the chief part -often nearly the whole. For a long time after the revival of learning, the classic writers were studied chiefly for their language and style, and those of them that did not meet an imaginary standard of purity were despised and neglected, however valuable they might be for their matter. But though great and even undue attention was thus given to language, it was only as an instrument, as means to an end. The philologist studied a language in order to be able to understand it and use it-to get at the thoughts conveyed in it, or to convey his own thoughts with force and elegance to others.\n",
      "This is the object of the grammars, dictionaries, annotated editions, and criticisms, which constitute the chief part of philological literature. But within recent years, P. has entered on a new phase, or rather a new field of study has been added to the old. As the naturalist investigates a class of objects not with a view to turn them to use, but to understand their nature, and classify them, so the modern school of philologists examine and compare the structures of the various languages, and arrange them in classes and families, with the ultimate view of arriving at some theory of language in general-its mode of origin and growth. The comparison of the structure of two or more languages is called Comparative Grammar, and the whole of this new branch of study is some. times designated Comparative P.; but it seems better to leave the old field in possession of the old name, and in distinction from P., as the practical knowledge of languages, to speak of the study of language as a phenomenon per se, as the Science of Language.

Both these theories may now be considered as given up by all who are entitled to speak on the subject.

Leibnitz was the first to set aside this notion, and to establish the principle that the study of languages must be conducted in the same way as that of the exact sciences, by first collecting as many facts as possible, and then proceeding by inductive reasoning.

      "B: ideas or conceptions, which constitute the substance or material part; and the relations of these ideas to one another, which constitute the formal part; and the nature of a language depends on the particular way in which the vocal expression of these two elements is combined. At the foundation of all worls lie Roots (q.v.), or simple sounds expressive of nning. Now, some languages, e.g., the Chinese (q.v.), as these roots in their naked form as words, the same syllable, according to its position, serving as noun, adjective, verb, etc.-e.g., ta means great, greatness, to be or to make great, greatly or very. The relational part of the thought mostly gets no vocal expression; it is only indicated by position, as when min, people, and li, power, are simply put together (min li) to signify the people's power. Relations not readily indicated by position are expressed in a round-about way by using additional significant words: thus, tschung (mass or multitude) jin (man): men; niu (woman) tsè (child) = daughter; y min li (employ people power) = with the people's power.\n",
      "Even in such cases, each root preserves its independence, and is felt to express its own radical meaning. Languages like the Chinese, whose development has been arrested at this rudimentary stage, are called Monosyllabic or Isolating.\n",
      "The next stage of development is that of the Agglutinate languages, by far the most numerous, including the Turanian and American families. In these, the relational part of thought obtains prominent vocal expression by separate roots joined or glued on to the significant roots as terminations. These terminations were originally themselves significant roots, and many of them are used still as separate significant words, though the greater part have sunk down to mere signs of cases and other relations. The compound expression thus formed never, however, attains perfect unity; the significant root always remains rigid, unobscured in its sense, and unchanged in form, and the termination is felt as something distinct from the body of the word.\n",

Thus, the root sev has the indefinite meaning of loving, and the inf. is sevmek, to love; which then, by the insertion of certain suffixes, can take on as many as 40 forms or voices-e.g., sev-me-mek, not to love; ser-e-me-mek, not to be able to love; sev-dir-mek, to cause to love; sev-dir-ish-mek, to cause one another to love; sev-il-mek, to be loved; sev-ile-me-mek, not to be able to be loved; etc. Each of these forms, then, runs through a large round of tenses and moods, with their persons and numbers.\n",

Against this theory it has been urged that there is no historical instance of a language so changing its type, and passing from one stage to another.

      "C, n. But though it may be fruitless to look for extensive identifications of the roots and grammatical forms of the Aryan tongues, even in the oldest forms to which we can trace them, with those of the Semitic, still more with Chinese or Turkish elements, it seems rash and unscientific to affirm that, going back to the radical stage, the development of all could not have begun from a common stock of monosyllabic roots. The wonderful transformations exhibited by language in the course of its known history seem sufficient ground for maintaining the possibility of origin in a common stock. On the other hand, the nature of the case forbids hope of ever being able to prove it; for the coincidences that occur (e.g., Chinese fu, Tibetan pha, Lat. and Gr. pa-ter, Eng. fa-ther; Chin. mu, Egyp. mu, Lat. and Gr. ma-tor, Eng. mo-ther) might arise from the mind and vocal organs of man being everywhere essentially the same.\n",

It is because there are such laws that a science of language is possible. In tracing words to their origin, and identifying them with words in other languages, we are guided no longer by mere similarity of sound; on the contrary, identity of sound is often a proof that a proposed etymology is wrong. It has been established, e.g., by induction (see GRIMMS LAW), that c in Latin is regularly represented by h in Gothic and English; while for Gothic or English c, the corresponding letter in Latin is g.

When the mind receives an impression or intuition, by an instinctive impulse, of the nature of reflex action, some outward expression-a gestre or vocal sound-breaks forth, which by association becomes a sign or symbol, to the individual and to his associates, of the impression or idea that gave it birth.\n",
      "Associated at first with individual impressions and objects, these sounds, by the process of abstraction, which is pre-eminently a human faculty, would gradually come to represent more generalized impressions-would become words, as distinguished from mere animal sounds.\n",
      "The necessity of words to think in is much insisted on by speculators on this subject, as being the motivepower in the generation of language; and no doubt it is true that, without language, thought could advance but little, if at all, beyond what is manifested by the brutes.\n",

Observation seems to favor the opinion, that man in solitude-if he could exist in solitude-would be as mute as the lower animals.\n",
      "The social nature of man helped to give birth to the germs of speech, no less than his rational nature; an instinctive desire to give a sensible sign of his impressions to his fellows was perhaps the primary impulse; the aid thus given to his own thinking powers, a secondary result. Be this as it may, it seems reasonable to assume, as it has been well put by Steinthal, that 'at the origin of humanity, the soul and the body were in such mutual dependence, that all the emotions of the soul had their echo in the body, principally in the organs of respiration and the voice. This sympathy of soul and body, still found in the infant and the savage, was intimate and fruitful in the primitive man; each intuition woke in him an accent or a sound.'-Farrar, Origin of Language.\n",
      "Were these sounds, then, guided by chance or caprice? or if not, what determined particular articulations to be associated with particular objects or ideas? Any mystic innate correspondence between sounds and things is out of the question; but what more reasonable than to suppose that the natural sounds emitted by so many things animate and inanimate, should suggest the character of the articulations which the ideas of the things called forth-not so as to produce exact imitations, which it Is not of the nature of articulate sounds to be, but such\n",

In some such way, by the unconscious working of man's intellectual nature, we may conceive language to have grown out of the exclamatory or interjectional stage into the rational structure that we now admire. This theory of the origin of roots, together with the constant operation of phonetic change, accounts for the absence of all traces of onomatopoeia in the great bulk of the words of a language, and seems to meet the objections of Max Müller and other philologists to the onomatopeic theory.\n",

At first, man's pursuit of knowledge was subservient to the immediate uses of life; but, in the course of time, an interest was taken in knowing the order of the world, independent of its application to the common utilities.

The most celebrated saying of this age was the Delphian inscription (of uncertain authorship), 'Know thyself.' The teaching of the Sophists made another stage in the history of moral philosophy.

Since that time, P. has come to mean more exclusively the inquiries connected with the mind, as exemplified in the writings of Hobbes, Locke, Leibnitz, Berkeley, Hume, Reid, Kant, etc. The qualified phrase Natural Philosophy (in the English sense) was applied to a special department of the outer world, as Moral Philosophy was used in connection with mind and the discussion of moral duties.

It is not certainly known of what these love-potions were composed-nor can we rely entirely on the details given on this subject by classic writers, and their commentators in later time-but there is no doubt that certain poisonous or deleterious herbs and drugs were among their chief ingredients, to which other substances, animal as well as vegetable, are said to have been added, coupled with the employment of magic rites. Thessaly had the credit of producing the most potent herbs, and her people were notorious as the most skilful practicers of magic arts, whence the well-known 'Thessala philtra' of Juvenal (vi. 610).

P., though seldom an original or idiopathic disease, is a frequent sequence of wounds, in which case it is termed traumatic phlebitis [from the Greek trauma, a wound], and is not uncom mon after delivery. The disease is indicated by great tenderness and pain along the course of the affected vessel, which feels like a hard knotted cord, and rolls under the fingers. The hardness is, however, sometimes obscured by the swelling of the limb beyond and about the seat of the disorder, partly in consequence of the effusion of serum caused by the obstruction to the return of the venous blood (which thus gives rise to a local dropsy)-\n",
      "PHLEBITIS.\n",
      "and partly in consequence of the propagation of the inflammation to the surrounding tissues. The inner surface of the inflamed vessel is supposed to throw out fibrinous fluid, which coagulates in layers, and finally closes the tube. If the vessel is small, the consequences of its obstruction may be of little importance; but when a large vein is affected, the consequences are always dangerous, and may be fatal. There are two modes of recovery: solution of the coagulated fibrine may take place, and the vessel may again become pervious; or, as is more frequent, the obstruction may continue, but a collateral venous circulation may be established, and the circulation thus carried on through a circuitous route.\n",

Either condition is dangerous; the latter pre-eminently so.-P. originates usually in some local injury of a vein, and the inflammation, once established, is readily propagated along the course of the vessel. Sometimes very slight injuries give rise to it. It occurs sometimes after venesection, especially with a dull lancet, or one soiled by contact with diseased matter. Women are liable to this disease after delivery, as the veins of the womb are apt to become inflamed, and to communicate the inflammation to the venous trunks connected with them: see PHLEGMASIA. There is considerable difference of opinion as to the treatment-some high authorities (Dr. Wood, e.g.) recommending the very free use of leeches along the affected vein,' and that they should be repeated over and over again if the symptoms of inflammation should persevere,' the subsequent application of cold lotions, and the internal use of mercury 'pushed to a moderate salivation;' while others question the utility of such treatment, and recommend 'rest, warm fomentations and poultices, early incision of abscesses, evacuation of bile and fæces by one or two doses of calomel, opium to relieve pain and insure quiet of mind and body, and wine, especially if there has been great loss of blood.'-Druitt's\n",

      "PHLEGMASIA DOLENS: disease most fre quent in women after parturition, especially if they have lost much blood, but occurring sometimes in unmarried women, and occasionally in men. Its usual beginning is a week or ten days after delivery, with a feeling of pain in the loins or lower part of the abdomen; whence it extends to the groin and down the thigh and leg. The pain soon becomes very severe, and follows principally the course of the internal cutaneous and crural nerve of the thigh and of the posterior tibial in the leg. The limb soon begins to swell, and in two days is sometimes twice its ordinary size; and as the swelling develops, the acuteness of the pain considerably diminishes. The limb is partly flexed, and lies motionless; any movement aggravates the pain. The swelling extends uniformly over the limb, which is pale and shining, and hot and firm to the touch, seldom pitting on pressure. The femoral vein may usually be felt like a hard cord, and this symptom, taken with the swelling, clearly indicates that this affection is essentially crural phlebitis. The uniformity of the cord is interrupted by nodules, arising either from inflamed cellular tissue, or from clots within the vein. Both legs are seldom attacked at the same time, and the left thigh is the most common seat of the disease.\n",
      "This affection usually terminates favorably, the acute symptoms disappearing in ten days or a fortnight. The swelling, however, often continues for a long time, sometimes through life. Very different opinions have been held regarding the nature of this disease. At one time it was considered as the result of metastatic secretion of milk (in other words, as due to the milk leaving the breast, and settling in the thigh; hence the term milk-ley). There is now no doubt that the disease in women is inflammation originating in the veins of the womb, and extending to the veins of the lower extremity.\n",

According to modern views, based mainly on Lavoisier's experiments, in the formation of acids and of earths, the addition of oxygen takes place instead of the subtraction of phlogiston.

He was of humble origin, but appears to have studied under Plato, Xenocrates, and perhaps Diogenes also, from the last of whom he may have acquired his habit of caustic sarcasm. His keen and biting wit gave him popular force as a speaker, while injuring him as a politic manager of men. P. was the only orator whom Demosthenes feared. Though gruff in manner, he was kind at heart. P. attracted notice first in the great sea-fight at Naxos (B.c. 376), where he commanded a division of the Athenian fleet, and materially helped to secure the victory. Yet we scarcely hear of him again for more than 20 years; but B.C. 351, with Evagoras, he undertook the conquest of Cyprus for the Persian monarch, Artaxerxes III. (Ochus), and was completely successful. About the same time (the exact date is uncertain), he led an Athenian expedition into the island of Euboea, where Philip of Macedon was intriguing, and inflicted a severe defeat on that powerful sovereign at Tamynæ. B.C. 341, he was again successful in crushing the Macedonian party in Euboea and restoring the ascendency of Athens. Two years before this, he had achieved a similar result at Megara; and 340, when sent to the aid of the Byzantines against Philip, he acted with so much prudence and tact, and inspired the citizens with so much zeal and courage, that Philip was forced to abandon the siege, and even to evacuate the Chersonesus; while P. captured several of his ships and coast-garrisons, besides making havoc in the Macedonian territory.\n",

The king sometimes combined in his person the office of high-priest.

Riddance was made of the unruly spirits in Roman fashion somehow in the colonies, or they were made silent by important places being intrusted to their care under strict supervision from home. Only once or twice do we hear of violent popular outbreaks, in consequence of one of which it was mockingly said that P. had lost all her aristocracy, and what existed of Phoenicians was of the lowest birth, the offspring of slaves. As the riches of all the world accumulated more and more in the Phoenician ports, luxury, and too great a desire to rest and enjoy their possessions in peace, induced the dauntless old pirates to intrust the guard of their cities to the mariners and mercenary soldiers, to Libyans and Lydians-they of Persia and of Lud and of Phut,' as the prophet Ezekiel has it; though the wild resistance which this small territory offered in her single towns to the enormous armies of Assyria, Babylonia, and Greece, shows that the old spirit had not died out.\n",

Another account is, that the P., when about to die, made a nest for itself in Arabia, from which a new P. sprang of itself. This bird proceeded to Heliopolis, and there burned and buried its father. But the more popu larly known version is, that the P. burned itself, and a new and young P. sprang from the ashes. A less received version is, that a worm crawled out of the body of the dead P., and became the future P.

      "In phonetic writing, the eye would no doubt confound such words as know and no, see and sea, sighs and size, when written separately, as in a vocabulary; but it cannot be supposed that such words would present more ambiguity in contextual usage than they now do in utterance, subject to the same confusion to the ear. At present, we have, in fact, two languages-one purely phonic, addressed to the ear; and the other, in some degree etymological or historical, addressed to the eye.\n",
      "In this respect, we are in a position similar to the Chinese, with their classical ideographic language of literature, and their multitudinous vernacular dialects. To establish the assertion that the phonic word (the sound) written phonetically in a sentence would be less intelligible to the eye than the written word in its present form, it is incumbent on the opponents of phoneticism to show that the simple phonic word is now less intelligible when pronounced in a sentence than its written symbol is when read in a sentence.\n",
      "The principal objection urged against phonetic writing is, that it would obscure the etymological history now discoverable in the orthography of a word. The best answer to this objection is, that the traces of etymology, preserved in the present spelling, are so imperfect and inconsistent as to be of little value compared with the embarrassments that they occasion in other respects. Further, they can be shown to be at times even misleading as to etymology.\n",
      "The first requisite for construction of a phonetic alphabet is an exact knowledge of elementary sounds, that every element may be provided with its appropriate symbol, and that no more symbols may be introduced than there are distinct elementary sounds. The latter consideration would be of importance only in connection with a general alphabet available for all languages.\n",
      "An alphabet for any individual language might contain symbols for compound sounds, with no other disadvantage than that of adding to the number of symbols.\n",
      "It would not, for instance, be of any consequence, so far as phonetic writing is concerned, whether the word sacks were represented by the letters saks, sacs, or sax, if the symbols used were invariably appropriated to the same sounds. Orthoepists and phoneticians are not agreed as to what elements compose many of our compound sounds, such as those heard in the words chair, queen, tune, I, out, etc. Any attempt, therefore, at representing compounds analytically would be premature, until the analysis of the compounds had been settled.\n",

In this scheme of phonotypes, diphthongal and articulate compounds were not analyzed, and the letters of the ordinary alphabet were retained in their most common signification, 17 new characters being introduced for unrepresented or ambiguously written sounds. The forms of these were, in most cases, happily suggestive of the displaced orthography, and the general aspect of the writing bore such a resemblance to common typography, that any good reader of the latter could decipher the new printing with ease, after very brief study of the alphabet.\n",
      "The ordinary vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U) were pronounced as in the words am, ell, ill, on, up; the consonants C and G were sounded as in came and game; the letters K, Q, X, were rejected as superfluous, and all the other letters of the common alphabet were retained, with their established sounds. Comparing this scheme of letters with the tabulated elementary sounds of English, we find that it represents all the vowels, except the nice varieties heard in the words air, ore, err, ask; and that all the consonants are accurately represented except wh.

As originally made, the instrument consisted of three parts-the sender, the receiver or recorder, and the transcriber. The sender consisted of a tube, having an open mouthpiece at one end, and bearing at the other end a thin diaphragm of metal or other substance, with a sharp point or style affixed to the centre of its outer surface. The second apparatus consisted of a cylinder, about four inches in diameter, having on its periphery a V-shaped groove cut spirally from end to end. Over this grooved cylinder a sheet of tinfoil was placed, and the sender advanced till the point of the style lightly touched the tinfoil, over the opening of the V-shaped cut. While the words to be recorded were spoken or sung, the cylinder was turned rapidly, the apparatus for moving it giving a lateral as well as a circular motion. The point of the style thus traversed the tinfoil spirally from end to end, and the vibrations in the diaphragm caused by the sounds resulted in a series of indentations in the tinfoil. To reproduce the sounds, the cylinder was again presented to a style attached to a diaphragm, the style being pressed against the tinfoi by a slight spring. The cylinder was then made to re\n",

      "Phosphate of Soda may occur under any one of the three forms 3Na,OP,O,, or 2Na2O*H₂O`P₂O,, or Na₂O 2H₂OP,O,. All these salts are soluble in water; and the first two have an alkaline reaction, while the third is acid. By exposure of the second of these salts (2Na₂O·H₂OP₂05) to a red heat, it is converted into what is termed pyrophosphate of soda (2Na₂OP₂O), in which the phosphoric acid is obviously no longer tribasic, but bibasic; and by similarly treating the third of these salts (Na,O 2H₂O·P₂O;), we convert it into the so-called metaphosphate of soda (Na,OP2O5), in which the phosphoric acid is monobasic. It is in consequence of these changes, under the action of heat, that the terms pyrophosphoric and metaphosphoric have been used as synonyms for bibasic and monobasic phosphoric acids. Phosphate of soda, in one or other of the above forms, occurs as a constituent of all the animal fluids and soft tissues of the body, but is abundant especially in the urine and the bile. There are reasons for believing that it is the second and third of these salts which occur as constituents of the animal body, though the first may possibly sometimes be found. Pyrophosphate and metaphosphate of soda are often found in the ashes of animal fluids or tissues after the process of incineration, but they result merely from the action of heat on the two other salts. The following remarks on the derivation, elimination, and physiological importance of the phosphates of soda, are applicable equally to the corresponding salts of potash always associated with them. The phosphates of the alkalies, which occur in the animal body, obviously owe their origin, either directly or indirectly, to the food-viz., directly, by being ingested as phosphates of the alkalies; or indirectly (within the system), by the action of phosphate of lime on salts of the alkalies. The elimination of these salts from the system is necessary, because they are being constantly supplied by the food; and this process is effected mainly by the kidneys and the intestinal canal. In the carnivorous animals, whose blood is much richer in phosphates than that of herbivora (the ash of the blood of the dog, e.g., contains 12 to 14 per cent. of phosphoric acid; while that of the ox or sheep does not contain more than from 4 to 6), these salts are carried off by the urine; but in consequence of the formation of free acids as products of disintegration of the tissues, a portion of the base is ab stracted from the originally alkaline phosphates, and à corresponding portion of phosphoric acid is liberated.\n",

Although the general distribution of the phosphates of the alkalies in the nutrient fluids (there is 40 per cent. of them in the ash of the blood-cells; 28:4 per cent. of phosphoric acid and 23.5 of potash in the ash of cows milk; and about 70 per cent. of phosphoric acid in the ash of the yolk of egg) is in itself an indication of their importance, the exact nature of their functions is not understood. Liebig has specially drawn attention to the peculiar grouping of the acid and alkaline fluids of the animal body. The permanence of this grouping is maintained, especially in herbivorous animals, chiefly by the conversion, within the body, of alkaline and neutral phosphates into acid phosphates by the means above described. Moreover, all tissue-forming substances (the protein bodies) are so closely connected with phosphates, that they remain associated during the solution and subsequent re-precipitation of these substances; and the ash of developed tissues (e.g., muscle, lung, liver, etc.) always affords evidence that acid phosphates existed in the recent tissue; and, further, no exudation from the blood-vessels can undergo transformation into cells and fibres, i.e., become organized, unless, in addition to other conditions, phosphates are present. Another convincing proof of the share taken by the phosphates in the formation and functions of the tissue is the fact that, though herbivorous animals take up a very small quantity of phosphates in their food, and though their blood is very poor in these salts, their tissues contain as large a proportion of phosphates as the corresponding parts of Carnivora. Lastly, the fact that one equivalent of the alkaline phosphate of soda (2Na₂O·H₂O·Р₂O) possesses the property of absorbing as much carbonic acid as two equivalents of carbonate of soda leads to the belief that the power of attracting carbonic acid, which the serum of the blood possesses, is due at least as much to the phosphate as to the carbonate of soda; and that, consequently, phosphate of soda has an important part in the respiratory process.\n",

If, however, the urine become alkaline from decomposition of the urea, a portion of the ammonia combines with the phosphate of magnesia, and forms the triple salt insoluble in the urine, which has now become alkaline. With this triple phosphate, there is almost always an admixture of phosphate of lime (3CaO.P₂O) in the form of an amorphous precipitate. The tendency to deposit the mixed phosphates (triple phosphate and amorphous phosphate of lime) is observed especially in cases of disease or injury of the spinal cord, and in disease of the bladder, particularly in chronic inflammation of its mucous coat. On allowing urine of this kind, which is usually pale in color, to stand for some time, an iridescent film or pellicle generally forms upon its surface, which, when examined under the microscope, is found to consist mainly of the salts we have described. Such urine speedily becomes putrid, and evolves a strong ammoniacal odor.\n",
      "The above is by far the most common form of the phosphatic deposits; but the urine may become alkaline from the presence of the carbonate of potash or soda, and then, no ammonia being present, in place of the triple salt, there is a deposition of amorphous phosphate of lime, or, in rare cases, of a crystalline stellar phosphate, 2CaO.P₂O,.H₂O. In these cases, the urine is alkaline, pale, copious, slightly turbid, of low specific gravity, and of peculiar odor. This urine makes reddened litmus paper permanently blue; while ammoniacal urine causes only a temporary change in the color of the same test-paper. As the urine cools, and sometimes even in the bladder, the white sand is deposited, occasionally giving the last portion of the excreted urine a milky appearance. During perfect health, the urine often becomes temporarily alkaline during the act of digestion (when the gastric juice is especially acid); but a continuous general tendency to alkalescence from a fixed alkali, and therefore to phosphatic deposits, is usually associated with general debility.

This oxide is removed by introduction into the fused metal of a carefully proportioned amount of phosphorus, which combines with the oxygen, forming phosphate; the latter is eliminated with the slag. The copper or bronze is thus greatly improved as regards tenacity and plasticity. A small excess of phosphorus, combining with the metal or metals, effects still further improvement.

Rays of light possess, in addition to their heating and lighting power, what is known as actinic or chemical power. This fact is seen in many cases, and is familiar in the fading of carpets and other dyed fabrics, when exposed to the sun. If over a readily faded material an opaque object is placed, and the whole is exposed to the sun, after a time an image giving the contour of the object will be produced by the fading of the unprotected parts of the fabric surrounding it, while the parts covered by the object retain their color. This would be a true photograph. Many chemical compounds are far more sensitive to light than the most fugitive dyes, and several of these are utilized in P. The above example of P. illustrates what is known as 'contact-printing. For work in the field, it is obvious that this would not answer, as contact would be quite impracticable.\n",
      "A, v.) is used to produce a focal image. In the exact plane of the image, a plate or film of some material sensitive to light is exposed for a short time to the rays reflected by objects, next passing through the lens, and finally coming to the conjugate foci in the locus of the focal image. This is the process of exposing the plate, often called taking the 'exposure.' The plate is unchanged, to all appearance, and shows no image; but it has been affected chemically, and those portions on which the light has acted are thrown into a state of unstable equilibrium; and on treatment with proper reducing agents, the image gradually appears. Next, by immersion in a solution which dissolves unaltered silver salts, the image alone is left on the plate, forming a negative, from which, by contact-printing, a positive is produced. At the outset, therefore, the terms 'positive' and 'negative,' constantly used in photography, are to be explained. In their ordinary meaning, one is the reverse of the other, as regards light and shade. But with respect to a photographic picture on glass, its being a positive or a negative really depends on whether it is viewed by reflected 23-37\n",

      "or by transmitted light. Daguerreotypes all are posi tives, because they are taken on metal plates, and can be seen only by reflected light. Our picture on glass also is positive when viewed in the same way; but as glass is transparent, the picture is negative when looked at by transmitted light-i.e., when held between the eye and the light. Those portions of the image which are light in the positive way are dark in the negative way. This will be quite plain to any one who looks at such a picture by both lights, laying it on black cloth for the positive view. The old ambrotype' was a negative on glass backed by a black coating, so that the transparent portions of the glass appeared black. The ferrotype,' still in use, is a negative on black-varnished iron. The black varnish shows through the transparent portions of the film, giving the desired effect. For convenience, it has become the practice to call a photographic picture a negative if it is intended to print positive pictures from it. In a negative, the parts intended to print black on the paper are completely transparent, the whites are completely opaque, and the gradations between are the intermediate shades. Usually, the negative is on glass, and the positives are prints on paper; but negatives are sometimes produced on paper made translucent by means of wax or castor-oil, or they may be on gelatin films.

On the front portion, a suitable glass lens is fixed, which throws the image on a ground-glass screen placed at the back, to enable it to be sharply focused.

Generally, plateholders are arranged to contain two plates: such are provided with two sliding shutters, one on each face.\n",

      "is of great importance. For the different forms and properties of LENSES, see LENS: a few words follow here about the kinds used in photography. A lens which is well adapted for taking portraits or other objects in a room is not suitable for taking landscapes. In the first case, it is necessary for the lens to give only a sharp definition of a figure a few feet off, and to do its work rapidly; while what is required in the other case is that distant objects, lying in far different planes, should be clearly defined. To effect this, the curves of the lenses, as well as their distance apart in the compound arrangement, must be different in each case. For ordinary landscape-work, indeed, a single lens of the meniscus form may be used, as the distortion that it gives is not much noticed; but a properly constructed double lens is better. When architectural subjects are to be photographed, a combination of lenses which correct all distortion must be adopted; otherwise vertical lines converge, and therefore appear out of the perpendicular. What is called a wide-angle' doublet lens is used for taking a view of a building in a narrow street, for interiors, and for similar cases, in which the operator cannot retire far enough to take in the whole object with an ordinary lens. A doublet lens of the ordinary kind for landscape-work embraces an angle of about 50°, while a wide-angle doublet embraces 90°, or even 100°; that is, these lenses cover circles whose respective diameters subtend angles of 50° and 90°-100° from their optical centres.\n",

Different sizes of stops are used, the largest aperture of which is much less in diameter than the lens itself. The aperture is placed opposite the centre of the lens. Since the central rays and the marginal rays have different points of intersection, the object would be wanting in definition if all the rays were used.\n",

It was found that if the emulsion was kept at a temperature of 90° F. for some days, or boiled for half an hour, the sensitiveness of the plate coated by it was so greatly increased that a view which could not formerly be taken in less than 30 seconds could now be taken in one.

Cannonballs in motion, as projected from the gun, have been photographed. In taking these photographs, what is called an instantaneous shutter' is generally employed for the lens of the camera-i.e., a cover which by some means, such as a spring, will admit light for only a fraction of a second. For the instantaneous shutter, Marcy & Anschutz have substituted a disk or a curtain with a radial aperture or a long slit, moved rapidly across the face of the sensitized plate in the camera.\n",
      "P: Silver Prints.-As above stated, the production of a silver print on paper depends on the action of light on chloride of silver. The process is still conducted in essentially the same way as it was originally by Fox Talbot. A sheet of paper prepared with chloride of silver is exposed to light under a negative, and pressed close to it in a printing-frame. In a short time, if the day is bright, a print of the picture is obtained, which is fixed by hyposulphite of soda (sodium hyposulphite). The details of the process are briefly as follow: (1) Suitable paper is coated on the surface with a smooth, thin layer of albumen, to which chloride of sodium or of ammonium has been added. (Occasionally, the paper is salted only—i.e., impregnated with chloride of sodium or common salt.) (2) Silvering of the paper by floating it, albumen side downward, on a solution of nitrate of silver, 60 grains of this substance being used for every ounce of water: it is afterward dried. (3) Exposure to light. The silvered paper is exposed behind the negative in a printing-frame with a glass front: the time of exposure varies from ten minutes to two or three hours, but occasionally much longer, according to the brightness of the light and the character of the negative. A visible image formed by reduction of the silver salts is produced. The frame is arranged to allow of inspection of the picture from time to time. (4) Toning. To give a pleasing color to the print, or to insure its permanency, it is usual to tone it in a solution of trichloride of gold. (5) Fixing. The print, when taken from the toning bath, is steeped in a solution of hyposulphite of soda, which removes the undarkened silver salt, and thus fixes the image. (6) Washing. Silver prints require to be washed thoroughly after treatment with the hyposulphite of soda. Imperfectly washed prints soon spot and fade.\n",

Abney suggests that these three simple experiments be tried: Prepare pieces of paper by brushing them over with a viscous solution of gelatin, in which is dissolved six per cent. of bichromate of potash, and expose them beneath negatives of line-engravings. On immersing one of them in cold water, it will be noticed that the parts protected from the light immediately begin to swell through the absorption of water, while those portions unprotected remain unchanged. On immersing another sheet in hot water, the protected gelatin will dissolve away entirely, while the rest will remain firmly attached to the surface of the paper. Let a third sheet of the exposed gelatinized paper be brushed over with thin, greasy, lithographic ink, and, after soaking in cold water, a wet sponge may be applied to remove all the ink that will come away.

Accordingly, the image which he got in the camera obscura on a silver plate coated with asphaltum was made bare, by application of a solvent, to those parts which were not rendered insoluble. As far as to the biting stage, a metal plateusually copper-is still treated in a similar way.

In etching with ferric acid, the opaque portions of the gelatin film are rendered insoluble and impermeable.

      "Graham Bell, his friends and assistants, devised about 50 forms of apparatus for so varying the transmission of light to prepared selenium as to produce audible sound.\n",
      "In the P. found most serviceable, the transmitter is a plane mirror of silvered microscope glass or thin mica; the receiver, fixed at a distance without any connection, is a parabolic reflecting mirror, in the focus of which is placed a sensitive selenium 'cell,' connected in local circuit with a battery and telephone. When the apparatus is used, a strong beam of light is concentrated by a lens in the plane mirror; the speaker directs his voice against the back of this mirror, which is thrown into vibrations corresponding with those of the voice. The reflected beam of light, to which similar vibrations are communicated, is directed through a lens to the receiving mirror, and creates in the selenium cell a rapidly intermittent current, which at the end of the telephone attached becomes audible again as vocal sound. When first described, the P. had been used effectively with a distance of 230 yards (more than a furlong) between transmitter and receiver. The rays of the oxyhydrogen light, or of an ordinary kerosene lamp, suffice for transmitting articulate speech. The loudest sounds obtained from the P. were produced by means of a perforated disk, noiselessly revolving so as rapidly to interrupt the light in transmission It was also found that a very audible sound could be procured from the selenium without the aid of telephone and battery. A beam of intermittent light will produce a strong musical note from the selenium. Further experiment showed that selenium is not the only substance thus sensitive to light. Still louder sounds than these obtained from the selenium directly, though not articulate, were got from diaphragms of hard Indiarubber and of antimony; and sounds of varying intensity were given out by many other substances, including gold, silver, zinc, lead, paper, parchment, and wood.\n",

      "T: 1. It is a law in physiology that different functions are not performed by the same organ: the stomach, liver, heart, eyes, ears, have each a separate duty. Different nerves are necessary to motion and feeling, and there is no instance of confusion among them. 2. The mental powers do not all come at once, as they would were the brain one organ: they appear successively, and the brain undergoes a corresponding change. 3 Genius varies in different persons: one has a turn, as it is called, for one thing, and another for something different. 4. Dreaming is explained by the doctrine of distinct organs which can act or rest alone. 5. Partial insanity, or madness on one point with sanity on every other, similarly points to a plurality of cerebral organs. 6. Partial injuries of the brain, affecting the mental manifestations of the injured parts, but leaving the other faculties sound, tend to the same conclusion. 7. There could be no such state of mind as the familiar one where our feelings contend with each other, if the brain were one organ.\n",
      "These are grounds for presuming that the brain is not single, but a cluster of organs, or at least that it is capable of acting in parts as well as in whole. For this conclusion the phrenologists consider that they have found satisfactory proofs in numerous observations, showing that particular manifestations of mind are proportioned, in intensity and frequency of recurrence, to the size or expansion of particular parts of the brainthis law being subject to modification in the case of the brain, as of the muscles and other parts of the body, by differences of health, quality, exercise, etc.\n",

      "18. Wonder.-Dr. Gall found the organ of this faculty large in seers of visions and dreamers of dreams, and in those who love to dwell on the marvellous, and easily believe in it. Persons who have it powerful are fond of news, especially if striking and wonderful, and are always expressing astonishment; their reading is much in the region of the marvellous, tales of wonder, of enchanters, ghosts, and witches. When the sentiment is excessive or diseased, it produces that peculiar fanaticism which attempts miracles, and (with Language active) speaks in unknown tongues.\n",

Ideality.-The organ of this faculty was observed by Dr. Gall to be prominent in the busts and portraits of deceased, and in the heads of a great number of living, poets: this confirmed to him the old classical adage, that the poet is born, not made.

      "Reflecting Faculties.\n",
      "The external senses, as generally received, are five in number-Touch, Taste, Smell, Hearing, and Sight. There seem to be two more-the Sense of Hunger and Thirst, and the Muscular Sense or that by which we feel the state of our muscles as acted on by force and resistance.\n",
      "Without this last sense, we could not keep our balance, or suit our movements to the laws of the mechanical world. Whether each sense has a special cerebral organ in addition to its external apparatus and nerves is a question regarded by phrenologists as still undetermined.\n",
      "22. Individuality, the first in the list of the perceptive faculties, is not easily defined. It is said to take cognizance of individual objects as such, e.g., a horse or a tree. Other knowing faculties perceive the form, color, size, and weight of the horse, but Individuality is thought to unite all these, and give the idea of a horse. It is regarded as the storehouse of knowledge of things simply existing. When it is strong, without being accompanied by reflecting power, the mind is full of facts, but unable to reason from them. After puberty, the size of the organ of Individuality, as well as of the neighboring organs of Size, Weight, Coloring, and Locality-all situated behind the superciliary ridge of the skull-is often rendered doubtful by the existence of a hollow space, of uncertain width and extent, between the two plates of the skull. This hollow is called the frontal sinus; and when it is large, there may be a great projection of the bone over the eyes, without a corresponding projection of brain within. When this part of the skull is flat, however, the organs must be at least as defective as the flatness indicates. Owing to the source of uncertainty here pointed out, and the smallness of the organs behind the eyebrows, the functions of those parts of the brain are not regarded as being so well ascertained as those of the larger organs, nor will a cautious phrenologist be too ready to pronounce them large.\n",

The supposed organ is situated at the inner extremities of the eyebrows, where they turn upon the nose. A perception of size (including distance) is important to our movements and actions, and essential to our safety.\n",

Locality.-Dr. Gall was led to the discovery of this faculty by comparing his own difficulties with a companion's facilities, in finding their way through the woods, where they had placed snares for birds, and marked nests, when studying natural history. Every material object must exist in some part of space, and that part of space becomes place in virtue of being so occupied, or in virtue of its relation to objects. Objects themselves are cognized by Individuality; but their place, the direction where they lie, the way to them, fall within the sphere of Locality. Its organ is large in those who find their way easily, and vividly remember places in which they have been. It materially aids the traveller, and is supposed to give a love for travelling.

Dr. Gall called the faculty le sens des rapports des nombres (The Sense of the Relations of Numbers), and assigned to it not only arithmetic, but mathematics in general. Dr. Spurzheim more correctly limits its functions to arithmetic, algebra, and logarithms; geometry being the products of other faculties, particularly Size and Locality.

      "30. Eventuality.-The organ is situated in the very centre of the forehead, and, when large, gives to this part of the head a rounded prominency. Individuality has been called the faculty of nouns; Eventuality is the faculty of verbs. The first perceives merely things that exist; the other, motion, change, event, history. The most powerful knowing minds have a large endowment of both Individuality and Eventuality; and such persons, even with moderate reflecting capability, are the clever men in society-the acute men of business-the ready, practical lawyers.

      "32. Tune. The organ of Tune is large in great musicians; and when it is small, there is incapacity to distinguish either melody or harmony. The great bulk of mankind possess it in moderate endowment, so as to be capable in some degree of enjoying music. Those in whom it is large and active become, in all stages of society, distinguished artists, exercising a peculiar power over their fellow-creatures, so as to rouse, melt, soothe, and gratify them at pleasure. But the gift, in this active form, is liable to be much modified according as it is accompanied by Adhesiveness, Combativeness, Ideality, Benevolence, Wit, and other faculties.\n",

The comparative facility with which different men clothe their thoughts in words, and learn to repeat them by heart, corresponds with the size of the organ of Language, which is situated on the superorbitar plate, immediately over the eyeball, and, when large, pushes the eye outward, and sometimes downward; producing, in the latter case, a wrinkling or pursing of the lower eyelid. Verbal memory is strong or weak, without relation to the strength or weakness of the memory of things, forms, or numbers.\n",

The middle of the upper part of his forehead was very prominent. The precise nature of the faculty has been much disputed among phrenologists, but they seem to agree that the perception of analogy depends on it.

The former writers on mind-Reid, Stewart, Brown, and others-gave, on the contrary, their chief care to the mental acts called Attention, Perception, Conception, etc., which they considered as faculties.

Instead of seeking their origin in Thrace, the best classical ethnologists seek it in the neighboring highlands of Armenia, whence the Phrygians are believed to have spread, at a period long before the dawn of authentic history, over the greater part of the Peninsula, and thence to have crossed into Europe, and occupied the greater part of Thrace, Macedonia, and Illyria; while the mythic Pelops, who colonized the Peloponnesus, and gave it his name, was said by tradition to be a Phrygian.\n",

In the earliest pianofortes, the hammer was raised from below by a button attached to an upright wire fixed on the back-end of the key. The\n",
      "PIANOFORTE.\n",
      "impulse given to the hammer caused it to strike the string, after which it immediately fell back on the button, leaving the string free to vibrate. This was called the single action. As the hammer, when resting on the button with the key pressed down, was thus necessarily at a little distance from the string, the effectual working of this action required that a certain impetus should be communicated to the hammer to enable it to touch the string. Hence it was impossible to play very piano, and it was found that if the hammer was adjusted so as to be too close to the string when resting on the button, it was apt not to leave the string till after the blow had been given, thereby deadening the sound. This defect was remedied by a jointed upright piece called the hopper, attached to the back-end of the key, in place of the wire and button. When the key was pressed down, the hopper, engaging in a notch in the lower side of the hammer, lifted it so close to the hammer, that the lightest possible pressure caused it to strike; and at this moment, when the key was still pressed down, the jointed part of the hopper, coming in contact with a fixed button as it rose, escaped from the notch, and let the hammer fall clear away from the string. To prevent the hammer from rebounding on the string, a projection called the check was fixed on the end of the key, which caught the edge of the hammer as it fell, and held it firmly enough to prevent it from rising. A necessary part of the action is the damper, which limits the duration of each particular note, so as to cause it to cease to sound as soon as the pressure is removed from the key. It consists of a pince of leather resting on the top of the string, and connected with the back-part of the key by a vertical wire. When any key is pressed down, its damper is raised off the string, so as to allow the sound produced to be clear and open; but immediately on the finger being lifted off the key, the damper-wire falls, and the damper again presses on the string, muffling and stopping the vibration. The whole range of dampers may, when required, be raised by the use of the damper-pedal, so as to prolong the sound of one note into another.\n",
      "One further frequent and important addition to the action may be alluded to. In the mechanism above described, the key must rise to its position of rest before the hopper will again engage in the notch of the hammer for another stroke; hence, a note cannot be repeated until time has been allowed for the full rise of the key.\n",
      "The repetition action is a contrivance, varying in different instruments, for riddance of this defect, by holding up the hammer at a certain height while the key is returning. For mode of producing the notes, see SOUND.\n",

      "Formerly, the strings of the P. all were of thin wire; now, the bass-strings are very thick, and coated with a fine coil of copper-wire; and the thickness, strength, and tension of the strings all diminish from the lower to the upper notes.\n",
      "A grand P. has three strings to each of the upper and middle notes, and now, generally, only two to the lower notes, and one to the lowest octave. When the soft pedal is pressed down, the hammers are shifted sideways, so as to strike only two strings instead of three, or one string instead of two.\n",
      "Besides the grand, the kinds of P. in use are the square, in which the strings are placed still in a horizontal position, but obliquely to the keys; and the upright, in which the strings run vertically from top to bottom of the instrument. The difference in form necessitates alterations in the details of the action, but the general principle is the same. The upright form has been greatly improved and developed in recent years, and has come into increasing favor. The P. as now developed possesses nearly all the powers of expression of any other instrument; on no other except the organ can such complete successions of harmonies be executed; no other represents the orchestra so well, with the advantage that the various parts adapted to it are brought out by the same performer. Its percussive effect has some advantage; but also some disadvantage in its lack of sustained or varied tone after the initial touch; and its temperament is such that without frequent tuning the constant use of the instrument tends to degrade the musical ear. Its popularity, however, is far beyond that of any other musical instrument.\n",
      "In all large cities of the civilized world are numerous manufacturers of the instrument, employing multitudes of workmen; and in Germany and the United States the manufacture is carried on in many of the secondary towns. Formerly, the German makers adopted a much less perfect action than the English, producing a very different touch and tone; but they are now largely using the English action, which is spreading over the European tontinent.\n",

      "of Milton, Mass., 1803. In 1820 Jonas Chickering (q.v., became associated with James Stewart in the manufacture of pianos in Boston. Apparently the business did not meet expectation, for two years later Stewart returned to England, where he became well known in connection with the house of Collard & Collard. This left Chickering master of the field, and he soon entered on the brilliant series of inventions which did so much for the art of piano-making. The first invention was the full iron frame, in a single casting, applied to grand pianos by Jonas Chickering 1837. It is claimed that an iron frame had been applied by Alpheus Babcock, 1825; . but this was a partial iron frame, only in part supporting the tensile pull of the strings. Many minor devices for improving the solidity of the instrument were invented and introduced from time to time, and in connection with them a continual advance was made in solidity, and in volume and singing quality of tone, which by 1851 had reached such perfection that the Chickering pianos shown in the London World's Fair excited profound attention. The volume of tone had been greatly increased by the circular' scale, invented 1845. This permitted the strings to be more widely separated than had been possible in the methods of stringing previously in use, and rendered it practicable to employ a heavier hammer, and so became the foundation upon which the later invention of over-stringing was based. The business, continued by the sons, has been enlarged until it is now one of the largest in the world.-Chickering constructed also the first upright piano ever made in America; though the first practicable instrument was by another maker.\n",

      "the tensile pull of the strings from about 20,000 lbs to more than 60,000 lbs. By general consent their pianos are regarded as superior in tonal capacity to any others made in the world; and their methods are closely copied by the best builders; and to the progress achieved by this house, starting from the inventions of Chickering, the American P. owes its superiority. Nearly all parts of the instrument have been improved by Steinway and Chickering, except one: the strings still remain wound upon steel tuning pins, which retain their tension solely by friction in a wooden wrest plank. A'patent stringer' has been invented and applied in the pianofortes of Mason & Hamlin, Boston, consisting of a 'set screw,' acting through a raised rim of the metal frame, whereby it is rendered impossible for the pin to slip, the prin ciple being the same as that of the patent head' of the guitar and cello, thus remedying all that part of getting out of tune due to the pins slipping. The tone also appears to be bettered by this device.\n",
      "In its present form, the art of P.-making appears to have nearly reached the limits possible for metal strings struck by felt hammers. The duration of the vibration, as well as its volume and capacity for color, have been enormously developed by American builders within the past half-century.

The constitution of the order was several times modified by successive popes, till the time of Innocent XI. Its field of operations has been confined to European countries; and at present it has communities in Italy, Austria, Spain, Hungary, and Poland. In Italy, during the revolutionary wars, the P. received into their ranks many members of the suppressed Soc. of the Jesuits.

When the leaves decay, the petioles or stalks split into bundles of cylindrical fibres of dark-brown color, and hard texture, varying in thickness from that of a horse-hair to that of a small crow-quill. This material has been found of great utility in making coarse brushes, particularly those required to sweep the street; for which purpose they have almost superseded birch-brooms, split whale-bone brushes, and similar implements for scavengers.

He early entered the Spanish military service, and after taking part in the Milanese campaigns, was sent as capt. with a Florentine cavalry regt. to aid Ferdinand II. against the Bohemians. As a cavalry leader, he distinguished himself; and from the regt. of cuirassiers under his command issued the death-dealing bullet to Gustavus Adolphus. In 1634 he was placed under the orders of Wallenstein, who took great liking to him, and confided to him his secret designs against the emperor: P., however, communicated these designs to the emperor, and received, as a reward for his fidelity, a part of Wallenstein's estate. During the remainder of this year, he was actually engaged against the Swedes, and greatly distinguished himself in the first battle of\n",
      "N, n. In the following season he was sent with\n",
      "20,000 troops to aid the Spaniards in the Netherlands, where the French and Dutch were carrying all before them. P. speedily drove out the French, but his success against the Dutch was not so marked. He was withdrawn by the emperor 1640 to stay the Swedes, who, under Baner, were threatening the hereditary possessions of Austria; and his success against these invaders in Bohemia and the Palatinate, though damped by the defeat inflicted on him in Silesia by Torstensohn, induced the king of Spain to entreat the emperor to send him again to the Netherlands to take the command of the Spanish troops. But his success was not nearly so decisive as before, the prestige of the Spanish infantry having been completely destroyed by the great Condé at Rocroi (1643, May 19). P., however, was again successful against both the French and Dutch till 1648, when he was anew summoned to Germany to encounter the victorious Swedes; but after a brief campaign, the peace of Westphalia (1648) ended his military career.\n",
      "He was created a field-marshal by the emperor, and was sent as plenipotentiary to the Congress of Nuremberg (1649), and soon afterward was raised to the dignity of a prince of the empire. The king of Spain conferred on him the order of the Golden Fleece, and bestowed on him in fief the duchy of Amalfi, which had previously\n",

Recent ethnologists have, however, suggested that the Picts may, in blood and descent as distinguished from language, have been mainly pre- Celtic and pre-Aryan (see Elton's Origins of English History, 1882); and Rhys affirms (Celtic Britain, 1883) that the North Picts were Ivernian (Euskarian and non- Aryan) in language also.

      "PIETISM: interesting and powerful religious movement in the Lutheran Church in Germany, during the last part of the 17th and first half of the 18th c. The term Pietists designates a religious party which, without forming a separate sect, had distinctive characteristics in opinion and in procedure. It is still applied to the same or like tendencies of opinion, feeling, and conduct. P. may be regarded as consisting in an exaltation of the importance of religious feeling and of godly practice, with a corresponding depreciation of doctrinal differences that do not concern the simple fundamental Christianity; and with a contempt for, or, at best, respectful indifference to, outward ecclesiastical arrangements. P. has been more or less strongly developed from time to time in all sections of the church; as the tendency toward it always exists in a large class of earnestly religious minds. This tendency has taken sometimes a disproportionate development. In the church of the middle ages, it was displayed in an endeavor to attain superior spirituality and purity by religious contemplation and asceticism; and many persons, consequently, embraced a monastic life. The Reformers, adopting the\n",
      "Augustinian doctrines, rejected this external mode of seeking deliverance from indwelling sin, and proclaimed the efficacy of faith in the sacrifice of Christ. But the' controversies which arose among them, and increased among their successors, gradually gave a too exclusively doctrinal and polemical character to the sermons and writings both of the Lutheran and of the Calvinistic divines, particularly in Germany; and a reaction ensued, not at all toward the Church of Rome, but in favor of a religion of pious feeling and good works, or of the heart and life. Disgust at the sectarian bitterness and exclusiveness which prevailed led even to an undervaluing of disputed points; thus the Pietism of Germany was generated and developed. Its origin is referred to a work, Vom wahren Christenthume, by John Arnd, 1605; to the\n",

Spener had held meetings somewhat similar in his own house when preacher at Frankfurt-on-the-Main, and in his writings had urged the necessity of a reform in the Prot. Church and theology.

      "PIETISM. many of the extreme Pietists carried their antipathy to the doctrinalism and the established services of the church to a degree that alarmed the theologians of the old school, the high and dry' Lutherans, or German moderates,' who accused Spener and his disciples, not entirely without reason, of a tendency to make all goodness and virtue consist in mere religious feeling, or pious sentimentalism; to represent the Divine grace as operating in too sudden and abrupt a manner; to exaggerate the value of good works; to depreciate the value of learning and of clear intellectual perception in the study of Scripture; and to indulge in a strictness of judgment on the religious character of the ordained clergy, tending to sectarianism, and indeed incompatible with ecclesiastical unity.

To do them justice, they were as far as possible from being ecclesiastically ambitious; all their desire was to excel in 'labors of love,' and to cultivate a disposition of intensest piety. The rise of the Wolfian or Rationalistic theology, the spread of that sort of skeptical anti-clerical philosophy which flourished for a while under the name Aufklärung (Enlightenment), exercised an injurious and depressing influence on P.; yet through all the long, obstinate warfare maintained against the doctrines of the church by the Rationalists, during the last half of the 18th and the most of the 19th c., P. continued to have adherents; and it is to the Pietists, and not to the dogmatists, that Germany is in great measure indebted for that revival of religious faith and feeling which, beginning with the great Schleiermacher-himself trained under pietistic influences-has since widely affected German biblical scholars and theologians. The patriotic enthusiam called forth by the insolent conquests of the French naturally allied itself to pietistic tendencies; for in Germany, the triumphs of Napoleon even as emperor were viewed as the triumphs of revolutionary, republican, and infidel principles; and after the general restoration of peace, the statesmen and upper classes, especially in Prussia, believing that political security could be obtained only by a return of the populace to the simple\n",

Pigeons begin to breed at the age of nine months, and breed every month except in very cold weather. The male and female continue faithful to each other from year to year-a circumstance noted by Pliny and others of the ancients, and evidently, as well as their somewhat demonstratively manifested affection, a reason of the poetic references often made to the dove.\n",

The P. is an inhabitant of more southern seas than the herring. The P. is found off the coasts of Ireland, France, Spain, and Portugal; and it is less plentiful than formerly on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall. Like the herring, it was formerly supposed to be migratory; but, as in the case of the herring, this opinion has been relinquished; and the shoals of pilchards seen on the coasts are believed merely to issue from deeper waters near, for the purpose of spawning. The spawning season begins early in summer; but on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, the principal fishery is in Aug. and Sep. Pilchards are caught either with drift-nets or seine-nets, principally with seine-nets. By means of one or more seines, each 360 ft. long and 36 ft. deep, a shoal is inclosed; the bottom of the net is then drawn together by a peculiar contrivance, and the pilchards are taken out at low water by small bag-nets. Prodigious numbers are sometimes inclosed in a single seine. More than 24 millions are said to have been taken at once from a single shoal, which, however, may have been spread over several sq. miles. The approach of a shoal is known by the rippling of the water, and the sea-birds hovering above, and is often watched for and marked from the shore.

He himself was a zealous pilgrim; and throughout the 4th, 5th, and 6th c. pilgrims habitually undertook the long and perilous journey to the Holy Land from almost every part of the West. Other sacred places, too, were deemed fit objects of like visits of religious veneration. The tombs of the apostles Peter and Paul, and of the martyrs in the catacombs at Rome, are so described by St. Jerome (Commentar. in Ezekiel). St. Basil speaks in the same terms of the tomb of the Forty Martyrs; and the historian Theodoret tells of not only visiting such sanctuaries, but of hanging up therein, as offerings, gold and silver ornaments, and even models of hands, feet, eyes, etc., in commemoration of the cures of diseases supernaturally obtained by these pious visits. The PILGRIMAGE, however, pre-eminently so called, was that of the Holy Land; and even after Jerusalem had been occupied by the Sara. cens, the liberty of pilgrimage, on payment of a tax, was formally secured by treaty; and it was from the necessity of protecting pilgrims from outrage that the well-known\n",

      "This church had sprung up at Scrooby in Nottinghamshire, close to Austerfield in Yorkshire, in connection with a kindred church 9 m. e. at Gainsborough, which had somewhat earlier organized secret exercise of worship apart from the established church of England. Such worship, forbidden by law under the penalties of sedition, and punished in several cases already by severe imprisonment and death, was desired and made a matter of conscience by a small class among the Puritans, who objected to state control of religion, to church organization on any basis except that of the local union or fellowship of Christ's true spiritual disciples, and to any imposition of forms in public worship by civil or ecclesiastical law, and to any restriction on entire freedom of study of Holy Scripture and of practice according to its precepts. The great body of Puritans, while equally desiring true religion, and some reforms in church order and worship, were strongly in favor of control of religion by law, and of belief and worship enacted and enforced. This great majority of Puritans joined in stigmatizing as 'Separatists,' and as guilty of schism' that class (at Scrooby, afterward at Leyden and Plymouth), whose principle was that of freely exercising the worship of God among themselves, without control from any, or any imposition of beliefs, forms, methods of organization, or of activity. The church Puritans and the non-church Puritans were thus opposed on English ground; and the latter had to flee as exiles for Christian liberty; while the former could stay in hope of themselves gaining power in the church, and thereby having their own way of control by law, of enacted and enforced faith and worship, and of church and social order strictly imposed. The 21,000 Puritans of this latter type, who came over 1628-40, and mainly settled New England, had little original affinity, on the ground of complete freedom of worship, with the Separatist Puritans (to whom indeed the name Puritans can scarcely with propriety be applied) from whom the Pilgrim Fathers Much, in fact, of the troubles of the latter were due to the antipathy of church-and-party Puritans toward nonchurch free Puritans, such as the Pilgrims were. came.\n",

Standish, a good soldier who had joined them in Holland, set out Nov. 15 for three days of exploration by land. The record of their outlook here is in these words: Being thus passed the vast ocean, which way so ever they turned their eye, save upward to the heavens, they could have little solace or content in respect of any outward objects. For summer being done, all things stared upon them with a weather-beaten face; and the whole country, full of woods, and thickets, presented a wild and savage hue. If they looked behind them, there was the mighty ocean which they had passed, and was now as a main bar and gulf to separate them from all the civil parts of the world. The second effort of exploration was made with the shallop, in which about 24 men and 10 seamen made a coastwise trip in the last days of Nov. and first of\n",

The storm growing more violent and night drawing on, they bore what sail they could to get in somewhere while they could see. But now the mast was broken into three pieces, and the sail carried overboard, in a sea which ran so high that they were in peril of being cast away; only, the flood tide being with them, they recovered themselves and struck into what seemed a harbor, but proved a cove full of breakers, out of which they barely escaped by pulling about and rowing desperately through the extreme darkness and a raging sea, the rain beating furiously on them, until they struck under the lee of a shore where they could lie until day broke, Dec. 9, revealing the island in Plymouth harbor known later as Clark's Island. It was a fair sunshiny day, secure from savages, and a Saturday, permitting them to dry their clothing, to put in order their guns, and to rest, and then to keep their Sabbath, Dec. 10. Monday (Dec. 11 of their reckoning, 21 of ours) they sounded the harbor and found it fit for shipping,' says Bradford; and marched into the land and found divers cornfields and little running brooks, a place (as they supposed) fit for situation; at least it was the best they could find, and the season and their present necessity made them glad to accept of it.

(our 25th), as Bradford relates, they weighed anchor to go to the place they had discovered, and came within two leagues of it, but were fain to bear up again; but the 16th day [our 26th] the wind came fair, and they arrived safe in this harbor. And afterwards took better view of the place, and resolved where to pitch their dwelling; and the 25th day began to erect the first house for common use to receive them and their goods.' They built with logs, with clay mortar in the chinks between them, and with roofs over which a cover of thatch was put. To make the common house, about 20 ft. square, 'some should make mortar, and some gather thatch,' says the_record, so that in four days half of it was thatched.' Dec. 28, so many as could went to work on the hill, where we purposed to build our platform for our ordnance'a combination of meeting-house and fort, with a place of assembly under a flat roof on which the artillery were mounted, guns 3 to 4 inches bore, with some smaller ones.\n",

A letter of later date, 1621, Dec. 11, says of the building plans carried out: 'We have built seven dwelling-houses and four for the use of the plantation, and have made preparation for divers others. The same letter shows that they used oiled paper for their windows. Jan. 9 they began to build houses on either side of 'Leyden' street, as the name came to be.

His powers of fasting were no less marvellous; he is said to have frequently limited himself to a single meal in the week, and during the 40 days of Lent to have abstained entirely from food. The fame of his sanctity brought crowds of pilgrims from the most distant countries, even Britain itself, to see him; and the admiration of his austerities is said to have converted many pagans and Saracens to the church. In trial of his virtue, through the test of humility, some neighboring monks reproaching him with vanity, and the love of novelty in this extraordinary mode of life, ordered him to come down from his pillar.\n",

It is said that in consequence of an ulcer which was formed on one of his legs, he was obliged for the last year of his life to remain on his pillar upon one foot. In this position he died in 460, aged 72 years. A disciple of Simeon, named Daniel, succeeded to his reputation for sanctity; and to his mode of life, which he maintained 33 years, in the still more trying climate of the shores of the Bosporus, about 4 m. from Constantinople. The marvels of Daniel's career are still more startling. He was sometimes almost blown by the storms of Thrace from the top of his pillar. At times for days together he was covered with snow and ice. How he sustained life, what nourishment he took, was a mystery even to his disciples. The emperor at length insisted on a covering being placed over the top of the pillar, and Daniel survived till the year 494.

It consisted of a stout plank fixed like a sign-board on top of a pole, the pole itself being supported on a wooden platform elevated from the ground. Above, and parallel to this plank, another of similar dimensions was placed in a similar position with respect to the pole, and fixed to the former by a hinge at one end, being thus capable of being moved upward from it, or closed upon it, when necessary. A large circular hole is cut, with its centre in the line of junction of the two planks, and two corresponding holes of smaller size are formed, one on each side of it; the large hole is for receiving the neck, the two smaller for the wrists. When a criminal is to be placed in the P., he is made to mount and stand upon the platform; the upper of the two hinged planks is raised to allow the culprit's neck and wrists to be inserted in their proper grooves, and then brought down into its place, and fastened by a padlock, or in some other way.

Its use was exclusively confined to this class of offenders till 1637, when restrictions were put on the press, and all who printed books without a license were put in the P. From this time it became the favorite mode of punishing libellers (or those who were considered such by the government), authors and publishers of seditious pamphlets, or of strictures on the government; and many eminent men were accordingly from this time put in and on the pillory,' e.g., Leighton, Lilburn and Warton, the printers, Prynne, Dr. Bastwick, Daniel Defoe, etc. The insufficiency of the P. as a means of inflicting a definite amount of punishment became apparent; for to those who were popular favorites it was no punishment at all, while those who were objects of popu lar dislike were ill-used to such an extent as occasionally to cause death. The sufferers above mentioned being popular favorites, or having at least numerous supporters, were shaded from the sun, fed, and otherwise carefully attended to; while the encouragement, applause, and sympathy of the crowd around converted the intended punishment into a triumph; but such men as Titus, Oates, and the class of offenders including perjurers, swindlers, polygamists, etc., who were objects of popular hatred and disgust, were pelted with rotten eggs (the favorite missile), garbage, mud, sometimes even with more dangerous missiles. In 1814 the celebrated naval hero Lord Cochrane (see DUNDONALD, EARL OF) was sentenced to the P.; but the government of the day was not prepared to brave the consequences of such an act, and the sentence was not carried into effect.

      "PILOT: person specially deputed to take charge of a ship while passing through a particular sea, reach, or dangerous or intricate channel. The intricacy of almost all coast navigation renders it impossible that any navigator, however skilful, can be master of all the waters into which he may have to sail his ship; and the risk of disaster, through ignorance of local dangers, is therefore avoided by transferring the direction of the ship's course to some one perfectly acquainted with the spot. The man to whom so much is intrusted must be a responsible person, and therefore in all countries qualified sailors are officially licensed to act as pilots in their districts, and they are granted the monopoly. The laws of Wisby, promulgated at least as early as the 14th c., subsequently incorporated in nearly every maritime code, render it compulsory on the master of a ship to employ a P. when sailing near a coast, In the United States, the regulation of P. service is left by congress to the several states, whose governments, through P. commissioners or similar officers, fix the conditions on which license shall be granted to pilots, and the offenses or derelictions that will work its cancellation or suspension, the states determine also the charges which pilots may lawfully make for their services. A shipmaster is usually required to accept the services of the first pilot boarding him; reciprocally, the P. is generally required to obey the call of the ship-master. Having taken the helm, the ship is navigated under the orders of the P. which, however, are, constructively, the master's orders, for the master does not relinquish his place: in the eyes of the law, as interpreted by U. S. courts, the owners of a vessel that meets with disaster while under the orders of a P. are responsible to shippers for any loss incurred by them. The license of the P. may be revoked for misconuct or inefficiency, and his fee (pilotage) forfeited; it is an open question whether he can be held liable for the damages resulting from his acts or his negligence.\n",
      "By British law, the command of the vessel, except in matters of discipline, is vested entirely in the P., who can use his discretion as to the sails, steering, etc., of the ship until the limit of the pilot's district is passed, except that the captain resumes his powers when the question of taking a place in a harbor is concerned. The general rule as to the responsibility of the owners of the ship is, that no owner or master of a ship is answerable to any person whatever for any loss or damage occasioned by the fault or incapacity of any qualified pilot acting in charge of such ship within any district where the employment of the pilot is compulsory.\n",

This did very little more than make solid heads to the pins, by a process in principle like that used for nail-making-driving a portion of the pin itself into a counter-sunk hole. The action, however, was automatic, and consisted in an arrangement by which the wire was seized in two small grooved cheeks, as in figs. 1. and 2. which represent them separated. Fig. 1 has the groove empty, but in fig. 2 is seen the wire which projects at a. When both cheeks are placed face to face, and the wire is held tightly in the groove with the small portion (a) projecting, a small ram or hammer connected with the machine strikes on a, and compresses it into the small cup-shaped depression b, and thus the head is formed, as in fig. 3. The pointing and dressing of the pins was afterward carried on as described in the processes for hand-made pins.\n",

It delights in a moist climate, and consequently does not thrive in the dry climate of s. Italy, though the warmth is sufficient. The first particular account of the P. was given by Oviedo 1535. It was cultivated in hot-houses first in Holland; but it was introduced into England in the end of the 17th c., and its cultivation rapidly became general in the gardens of the wealthy. Since the peace of 1815 it has received similar attention in continental Europe. Great care is requisite in its cultivation; otherwise it is generally fibrous and coarse, with little sweetness or flavor; but with careful culture, one of the most delicate and richly flavored of fruits. Its size also depends very much on cultivation. The weight varies from 2 to 12 lbs.\n",
      "In the cultivation of the P in northern countries, a tropical heat must always be maintained. The cultivation is generally in hothouses especially appropriated to it, called Pineries or Pine-stores; sometimes also in flued pits; sometimes even without fire-heat, in frames continually sup plied with fresh tanners' bark and dung. The universal practice formerly was to grow the plants in pots, plunged to the requisite depth in tanners' bark or other fermenting matter; and these were transferred from one house or one compartment to another, according to their stage of advancement, three years' culture being deemed requisite from the planting of a crown or sucker to the production of the ripe fruit; but the P. is now often planted in beds, and fruit of the best quality is sometimes obtained in fifteen months. The best soil is a rich and rather sandy loam, formed often from the turf of old pastures, with dung, peat, sand, etc., thoroughly mixed. Ventilation must be freely allowed from time to time, but care must be taken to keep the atmosphere moist. A P. which has borne fruit is thrown away as useless.\n",
      "There are many varieties in cultivation, differing in the more or less spiny serratures of the leaves, the globular, cylindrical, or pyramidal fruit, its size, etc. A spirituous liquor (Pineapple Rum) is made from the P. in some warm countries. -For the use of the fibre of the P., see\n",

Wooden pipes, formerly used for conveying water and for draining, have given place to pipes of metal and earthenware. For agricultural purposes drain-tiles are of ordinary brick-clay; and are produced very rapidly and cheaply by machinery. They are of various sizes: a common size is 15 inches in length by 24 inches diameter. The operation of the drain-tile machine is to squeeze a continuous length of soft plastic clay through a ring-shape orifice, the centre of which is occupied by a core or mandrel of the size of the hollow part of the pipe. Another arrangement of the machine is to cut the pipe to the proper lengths as it passes through, and by means of a travelling-table, to carry these forward to be removed to the sheds, where they are dried, previous to being burned in the kilns.\n",

These are greatly used for the drainage of houses, and for sewering, for which they are Fig. 1. admirably adapted: the inner surface being glazed as well as the outer, offers no resistance to sedimentary matters, which are consequently carried away readily. These pipes are of great strength. Instead of the ordinary socket-jointed circular pipes, Norman Shaw, one of the leading architects of London, uses a culvert of an egg-shaped section, open all along the top, with a rebated flange to receive flat covers. About the laying of these covers there is no difficulty, and when laid they can be inspected from end to end, each joint examined, and the uniformity of the fall tested accurately. Should an imperfectly laid culvert be detected, it is easily taken out and another put in its place. When the culverts are found to be all well laid, and when the whole has been examined, the loose covers are laid in and pointed with cement, and then the whole covered over with portland cement. Ir at any time the drain has to be examined, it is at least as easy to cut through the cement bed and chip out a covering tile as to cut a hole in a drain-pipe. But in fact, as the culverts can be laid correctly, there will very rarely be any occasion for cutting into them. They can be made of glazed earthenware or of Portland cement. Another kind, for chimney flues, are also made of fire-clay, but unglazed externally, and so thick, that there is little fear of breaking.

He worked on the principle of studying nature, modified or corrected by the ideal of antique sculpture; and it is said that he adopted this principle from the sculpture on an ancient sarcophagus brought from Greece in the ships of Pisa; but though most of the finest specimens of Greek sculpture were not discovered till long after P.'s time, he must have had opportunity of studying many important remains on the various classic ruins with which Italy abounds. This sculptor's reputation is supported by three important works, still admired-the pulpit of the baptistery at Pisa, the 'Arca' or shrine of St. Dominic for the church of that saint at Bologna, and the pulpit of the cathedral at Siena. The first, finished 1260, is reckoned the most elegant pulpit in Italy: it is of white marble, six-sided, supported by seven Corinthian columns, and adorned with five bas-reliefs of subjects from the New Test. The second work, the 'Arca' of St. Dominic, is of greater extent: it is composed of six large bas-reliefs, delineating the six principal events in the legend of St Dominic, and is ornamented with statues of our Savior, the Virgin, and the four doctors of the church.\n",

In these compositions there is great felicity of invention and grouping, truth of expression and grace in attitudes and draperies; and in that of the Last Judgment the boldness displayed in the naked figures, twisted and contorted into every imaginable attitude, is wonderful, and evinces the skill with which P. drew on the antique and on nature.\n",

In the same way the milt was taken from the male. The pressing operation was repeated at intervals several times. The eggs were then well mixed with the milt, and the water changed so as to be constantly fresh. The fecundation being completed, the eggs were placed for security in a covered vessel.\n",
      "This was originally of zinc, perforated with small holes, and had a layer of gravel on the bottom. A limited number of eggs were inclosed in the box, and the box placed in a current of pure water and covered with pebbles, care being taken to let the water pass freely through, as it is necessary for the eggs to be slightly agitated. The hatching takes place in two to four months, the time depending on the nature of the water and other circumstances. After the hatched fish are fully formed, they are, after 8 to 15 days, set at liberty from the box; though much depends on the kind of fish that is being dealt with.\n",
      "T, n. In the bottom of each box four wooden frames are neatly fitted, each of which has rather more than 100 glass tubes, about one-fourth inch diameter, placed transversely. Upon these glass grills the fish-eggs lie in parallel rows, looking like small pink beads. As fast as they hatch out and begin to take food, they are carried by a constantly flowing stream into successive cisterns or tanks. Many hatchingboxes and rearing-tanks are constructed of wood charied on the internal surfaces, and painted on the outside; slate also is used and sometimes carthenware, but in such cases they are of smaller size. When the fish arrive at the proper size and age, they are transferred to ponds, often very extensive and ingeniously planned both for beauty and convenience.\n",

In addition to the work done in stocking the American rivers with edible fish, vast numbers of eggs are from time to time shipped to Europe with greater or less success. While American fish are being transferred to European waters, European fish are planted in American waters, so that a very large variety is the result. To aid in selecting the right kind of fish for given localities, the fish commission have issued instructions, comprising a series of questions to be answered by the applicant. These questions relate to the geographical and geological features of the region, to the water, whether running or stagnant, whether with mud bottom, rock, or sand; its depth, area, spring supply or lake supply, etc. Thus are supplied the eggs and fry of the kind of fish that will best flourish in the locality.\n",

It is traversed throughout its length by a canal, which, however, is in general partly filled by cells projecting from its sides, and often also by very slender tubes extending in the direction of its length; the function of the canal, to which the inclosed slender tubes are in some way subservient, being to bring about the connection between the pollen and the ovules for Fecundation (q.v.). The length of the style is adapted to the ready fecundation of the ovules, being such that the pollen may most easily reach the stigma; and in erect flowers, the styles are usually shorter than the stamens; in drooping flowers, they are larger than the stamens.

The fineness of William's mind,' his mother writes of him, when he was but 12 years old, 'makes him enjoy with the greatest pleasure what would be above the reach of any other creature of his small age.' The excessive delicacy of his constitution prevented his education at a public school, but he studied at home with success; and in 1773 he was sent to the Univ. of Cambridge, where his knowledge of the classics seems to have astonished veteran critics To modern literature he appears to have been indifferent-he knew no continental language except French, and that very imperfectly. Among English poets, he liked Milton best; the debate in Pandemonium being his favorite passage.\n",

The latter consisted chiefly of the oldfollowers of Chatham; and to this party Pitt naturally became attached. 1781, Feb. 26, he made his first speech in parliament. It was in favor of Burke's plan of economical reform, and was a splendid success. It is not a chip of the old block,' said Burke; it is the old block himself.'\n",
      "S, n. No one was so loud in eulogy as Henry Dundas, lord advocate for Scotland; and from this night dates a connection between him and P., broken only by death. After several defeats the ministry resigned, and Rockingham was called on to construct a cabinet. P. was offered the vice-treasurership of Ireland; but he declined to accept a position which did not confer a seat in the cabinet. 1782, May 7, he made his first motion for a reform in the representation of the people; which was lost by only 20 votes in a house of more than 300 members. The reformers never again had so good a division till 1831. At the end of three months after his accession to office, Rockingham died;\n",

Pecuniary disinterestedness is what all can comprehend; and even when known to be overwhelmed with debt, when millions were passing through his hands, when the greatest men in the land were soliciting him for honors, no one ever dared to accuse him of touching unlawful gain. At the general election (1784) 160 supporters of the Coalition lost their seats, P. himself heading the poll for the Univ. of Cambridge. He was now, at 25 years old, the most powerful subject that England had seen for many generations.
