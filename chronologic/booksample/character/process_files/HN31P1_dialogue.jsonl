While he bounded to her assistance with long elastic leaps, he noticed a sweet face, rosy red with exercise, a pair of dark eyes sparkling with excitement, slim feet, straight ankles, and under a scarlet cloak, flapping riotously in the gale, the shapely supple figure that belongs to a well-built girl of nineteen. \"Pardon, mademoiselle!

While he stamped and shook the snow from his boots and shooting-dress, she had leisure to examine her new acquaintance furtively, from under her eyelashes, observing, without looking, as only a woman can. Yes, he was handsome, there could be no question. Slight, graceful, well-proportioned, with an air of confident, careless goodnature that possessed a certain charm. More experienced perceptions would have read profligate in every line of that delicate high-bred face, but she only saw a refined beauty, too feminine perhaps for her taste, and the polish of a society she never hoped and scarcely wished to enter. Altogether she retained her presence of mind very creditably for a \"girl of the people,\" just pulled out of the snow by a peer of France! B 2\nROSINE. \"I thank you, monsieur,\" she said, drawing herself up, keeping him, as it were, at arm's length. \"I, too, have very little farther to go, and I would not, for all the world, that you should walk a step out of your way on my account. Again I thank you, Monsieur le Comte, a thousand times, and-and-I wish you good evening, monsieur; they will be anxious about me at home.\" \"You are in a hurry, mademoiselle,\" he answered lightly, \"so am I; we will walk fast, but we will walk together. I cannot suffer you to be alone with all these wolves. Look at their tracks. Are you not afraid, or have you, with the face of a Hebe, the heart of a grenadier ?”\n\nShe did not know what a Hebe meant, but his gaiety was catching, and she replied with a laugh, checked even as it rose: \"There are wolves of many kinds, monsieur, in these forests. Some go about on two legs and in sheeps' clothing -these, I am told, are the hungriest and most dangerous.\" \"Meaning me!\" he exclaimed. \"Ah, mademoiselle! what a good chance for the wolf to wear fleecy hosiery in such cold as this! But see! he takes off his sheepskin to shelter you. Have you not a kind word for him now ?\" While he spoke, he stripped off a loose upper jacket lined with fur, and wrapped it round her shoulders, as another blast drove its snow-cloud over their heads. She could not but be grateful for the attention; nor, indeed, could she fail to remark the neat, well-chosen dress and symmetrical figure that he thus exposed to the storm. \"It is too much, monsieur,\" she murmured; \"too much kindness, too much honour. Do you know who I am?\" \"Red Riding-hood, I believe,\" he replied. \"Will you not take me to the cottage and present me to the grandmother? Even if I am a wolf, as you seem to think, I couldn't eat a grandmother!\" THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. 5 She laughed out now, and the laugh, with her dimples and white teeth, was pleasant to see as well as hear. \"But we are \"You shouldn't eat mine,\" she answered. not afraid of wolves in our little cottage.

Yes, there was a monotony about the whole thing, there seemed so little difference between one woman and another; their saloons, their furniture, their jewels, fans, and pocket-handkerchiefs, all of one pattern; their jests, their conversation, their reflections, all born of one idea; their blushes, smiles, tears, sulks, and caresses, all repetitions of one part, not very well performed. The same thing had to be said over and over again, of course, but how tiresome to hear it in the same words! and, for himself, it was surely too cruel a tax on a man's invention to bid him find out, on every occasion, some new way of acknowledging a smile, glancing a reproach, blocking the corner of an operabox, presenting a bouquet, conveying a note, or squeezing a hand. What had the world to give? Even in Paris-splendid, sparkling, gay, and wicked Paris? He asked the question aloud, and it seemed that a ghost rose up in the smoke of his wood fire the ghost of himself, bent, worn-out, exhausted-a shrivelled, decrepit old man-and answered \"Satiety!\" Could he deny it? He had drank greedily at the cup of pleasure, and found it not so sweet after all. Everything palled: love and liquor had lost their stimulus, the court, the chase, the theatre, the card-room-all were stupider one than another. It seemed high time to find a new distraction, a fresh occupation for life. At the very moment Pierre shot the old grey wolf in the snow, Count Arnold was making up his mind that he would\nPRIVILEGE. 23 visit all the cottagers on his estate in regular rotation, beginning with Rosine and her grandmother next day. He found the girl busy at household work, singing blithe and merry as a bird on a bough. She looked prettier than ever; and reassured, no doubt, by the presence of another woman, seemed to have left her shyness of yesterday in the snow. He was too old a campaigner not to open the trenches warily. He acted the part of good landlord to perfection, listening to her grandmother's grievances with an air of courteous attention, and promised a new roof to the outhouse, making a memorandum in his pocket-book of the same, before he addressed a syllable to Rosine. Then he directed his batteries against the angle of the fortress that his experience taught him was likely to be its weakest part. Reflecting how accustomed she must be to compliments on her beauty, he would make her understand that for him this was the least of her many attractions. \"I thought,\" he began, \"when I came down into the forest I must forget my fellow-creatures, and live all by myself in my castle, like a bear in a hollow tree. I am charmed to find, mademoiselle, that there is society here as polite and pleasant, if not so artificial as in Paris.” \n\nThe good sisters taught \n\nAh! you should see her \"Ah! monseigneur,\" interrupted her grandmother, while the younger woman blushed and smiled, \"it is not every day one meets, in the smoke of a cottage kitchen, such a girl as our Rosine. She has had an education, do you understand. She has been in a convent. her to read, and write, and sew. embroidery! And the piano! how she touches the piano! Monseigneur, if that was only a harpsichord, instead of a kitchen dresser, she should sit down and play you air after air, like an angel from heaven.\" \"I have a harpsichord in my house,\" said the Count, \"as\nROSINE. well as a kitchen dresser. I shall be flattered if mademoiselle will come and practise on either whenever she has a mind.\" Rosine's eyes brightened, but the old woman shook her head. \"Our Rosine has been well brought up,\" she said, \"and comes of honest people, monseigneur."}, {"chunk": 20, "character": "Montarbas", "dialogue": "Court favour is like sunshine, it cannot penetrate if you run into the shade.

It stings him to reflect that no attraction is left in that picturesque solitude now. The\nROSINE. castle is a blank, the forest a blank; Rosine's deserted cottage the dreariest blank of all! He had trudged through the snow to pay his accustomed visit, dressed even more carefully than usual-for it was his maxim to be abrupt with a duchess, but ceremonious with a dairymaid and had found the hearth fireless, the house untenanted. It was some time before he could realise the trick thus played on him, before he could believe it possible that his own people should have dared to decline his favours, and repudiate his authority. Only after research and inquiry did he become convinced of the fact that Pierre Legros had decamped with his promised bride, to some hiding-place beyond the reach of feudal superiority and its hateful privileges. It is difficult enough for the red man to destroy his trail as he leaves it behind him in the wilderness, covering the foot prints with leaves and grass, traversing to and fro, winding in and out to baffle his enemy; but in a civilised country money and influence can wrest information from the very bird of the air; and a fugitive may no more hope to elude pursuit than a hunted deer with a pack of bloodhounds on her track. In a few days Count Arnold had ascertained that Rosine's destination was Paris. In a few more he was himself at the Hotel Montarbas, within a musket-shot of the Tuileries; and but for the exigencies of rank, which obliged him to wait on their majesties at the earliest opportunity, he would have been at this moment seeking his prey through the alleys and suburbs of the capital, rather than exchanging compliments with a mob of lords and ladies in the ante-room of the Queen's apartments at Versailles. If not instructive, the conversation is incessant; to the initiated, perhaps, amusing; to the rest simply unintelligible. Their Majesties, if the King can tear himself from his work-\nVERSAILLES. 49 shop, have expressed an intention of visiting Trianon in the afternoon, and those who have a right to accompany the Court may be distinguished easily enough, the gentlemen by a rich uniform of scarlet and gold lace, worn for Trianon, as blue for Choisy, and green for Compiègne; the ladies, by an air of peculiar superiority and self-satisfaction, finding vent in an excess of politeness, so marked and elaborate as to be almost rude. \"Are you not coming with us?\" asked De Favras, a chivalrous young nobleman, so devoted to the throne that it was said of him \"he was more royalist than royalty.\" \"You will have no time to make a second toilet, for Her Majesty has ordered the sledges at two o'clock, and means to start directly after dinner.\" \"My friend, I am only here as an outsider,\" answered\n\nMontarbas, looking down on his own costly but sad-coloured suit with a smile. \"Court favour is like sunshine, it cannot penetrate if you run into the shade. I shall walk through, make my bow, observe how many tiers have been added to the \n\nQueen's head-dress in my absence, and while you, Marquis, are standing uncovered in the cold, I shall be back at Paris.\" \"Paris!\" repeated the other. \"I understand-some new attraction. Will you never reform, Count, and leave these follies for the great game of life?\" \"Bah! the great game, Marquis. What is it? What is any game but a mere question of stakes? A man with a million francs in his pocket does not care to win forty or fifty crowns. Show me how to sweep the board, and I will listen with both ears. In the meantime it is not worth while to be a lord-in-waiting, a comptroller of the household, or a private secretary with nothing to do. So I am going back to Paris. I can amuse myself in Paris.\" 66 Nobody better,\" said his friend, while the doors opened, and a general rush was made for the queen's bedchamber."}, {"chunk": 22, "character": "Count Arnold", "dialogue": "I make you my compliments then, you cannot silence a battery with your rapiers, and, when the king and queen have spent your money, how are you to keep a hundred men together in the field?", "summary": "A heated exchange among French court officials unfolds, with Count Arnold challenging De Favras and others on military matters while Marie Antoinette greets Count Arnold and discusses political concerns.", "passage": "\"Neither,\" answered De Favras, brimming with loyalty and enthusiasm; \"we know how to use our swords, and our purses are at the disposal of their majesties.” \"I make you my compliments then,\" replied Count Arnold; \"you cannot silence a battery with your rapiers, and, when the king and queen have spent your money, how are you to keep a hundred men together in the field?\" \"Yet you are a Montarbas of Montarbas,\" said the \n\nMarquis, with a sigh. \"Alas! for France; there is neither hope nor faith left.\" \"Nor charity!\" answered the other, \"except that which begins and ends at home. Depend upon it, my friend, the time is not far off when it will be every man for himself, and the devil for us all!\" Such opinions, however, were not to be proclaimed in the Queen's chamber, and Montarbas made his bow to her Majesty, with an air of devotion and loyalty not to have been exceeded by a knight of the olden time. Nevertheless, in such a society as that of Versailles, every courtier's sentiments, however discreetly kept in the background, were sure to be canvassed and misjudged. Although the above conversation was strictly private, although the Marquis was too honourable, the Count too discreet to breathe a syllable of its purport, yet enough leaked out to throw\nVERSAILLES. 53 suspicion, presumed rather than expressed, on the loyalty of the latter, who began to be considered as inclined to that party against which De Favras was making his futile preparations—a party to be stamped out if weak and helpless, to be conciliated if, as seemed too obvious, it was gaining strength in town and country day by day. The king was a bad politician, though a good locksmith; and Marie Antoinette had long since found that it required a steadier hand than hers to hold the balance between opposing factions, who hesitated at nothing foul or fair in pursuit of their own ignoble ends. Yet, when she gave herself time to think, she did her best. Having received De Favras with unconcealed favour, it was necessary to be more than usually gracious to Montarbas. She had not inherited her imperial mother's tact and prudence. Cold and calculating Maria Theresa never committed herself, but Marie Antoinette, impressionable and impulsive, was disposed to overact her part. \"Welcome to Court, Count Arnold!\" said she, with a kinder smile than the dignity of a sovereign usually bestows on a subject. \"We expected you back from \n\nMontarbas a week ago, and had almost given you up. Madame de Polignac vowed you had been eaten by your own wolves in the snow. But I have hunted in Rambouillet, and know its attractions, so I had no fears for your safety.\" He bowed low, and glanced anxiously in her face. The \n\nCourt knew everything. Could she have heard about \n\nRosine? What did it all mean? Her eyes met his own so kindly that he began to lose his head. \"Your \"Nothing but necessity would have prevented my returning to wait upon your Majesty,\" he answered. faithful servants, Madame, never feel really to live but in the sunshine of your presence. \"You seem to have done very well without it, Mon-\nROSINE. sieur,\" she laughed, \"even in this wintry weather. You do not look like a flower that has been fading in the shade. But the wolves. I have never hunted a wolf. Tell me, how many have you killed since the snow began to fall ?\" \"If your Majesty would honour my poor forest with a visit,\" he replied, \"you would see a wolf-chase to the greatest advantage. They should die by scores at your feet, as their lord would be proud to do if it afforded you the slightest amusement!\" \"More unlikely things have come to pass,\" said the\n\nQueen, surprised perhaps rather than gratified at the effect of a few sweet words. \"The skin of a black wolf would make a warm apron for my sledge!\" \"Will your Majesty deign to accept one from the most devoted of your servants?\""}, {"chunk": 23, "character": "Count Arnold", "dialogue": "When it wraps the most beautiful lady in Europe, will you not, Madame, condescend to remember me?", "summary": "Count Arnold demands a lady remember him and receives a curt reply.", "passage": "he exclaimed, bowing once more till his lips touched her dress; and adding in a voice so low and so full of meaning, that it became an insolence: \"When it wraps the most beautiful lady in Europe, will you not, Madame, condescend to remember me?\" 66 In how changed a tone came the cold and cutting answer \n\nCertainly, Monsieur; and the more so that you seem to have forgotten yourself. You may pass on. I shall not expect to see you again while the Court remains at Versailles.\" CHAPTER VII. BREAKERS AHEAD.' \"You may pass on!\" The words would not die out of his ears, would not lose themselves in the hum of voices, the shouting of lackeys, grinding of wheels, or ring of firelocks, as the Swiss guards relieved each other at their posts. They stung, they maddened him, they seemed to poison his very blood. What had come to him? Was he awake or dreaming? Could he be the same Count Arnold, who used to boast that woman had never flouted him but in pique, nor looked harshly in his face but from jealousy and excess of love? Was it possible that this Austrian archduchess could be insensible to his homage, and stand on her dignity forsooth, as Queen of France? She, whom he had seen so frank and unbending with scores of others, his inferiors in rank, station, intelligence, above all in charm of manner and good looks! She should pay for it, and dearly! She had wounded his pride, outraged his self-love, insulted him before the whole Court. She would regret it some day, too late, when, as leader of the popular party, he should constrain this imperious and scornful princess to wait humbly on his will. Yes! that was the side to choose! There was a career that promised prizes worth the winning to men of courage and talent, reckless too, like himself, as having little left to lose, and wholly unburdened with scruples of right and wrong. ROSINE. Besides, he was noble, and they would receive him with open arms. The title of aristocrat, though they might use it as a reproach, was in truth a sure passport to their favour. He was eloquent, he would speak in their \n\nChamber; he was brave, he would lead their columns. What should prevent his becoming the sovereign dictator, the absolute president of a people who had declared themselves free? Cromwell did it; and Cromwell after all was a mere burgess, a plain-featured, hard-headed islander, with none of the brilliant qualities that seemed essential to political success; and of which he, Montarbas, was gifted with so desirable a share! Oliver had refused the crown of England. Was it quite impossible that the changes and chances of the great game should inscribe his own name on the page of history, as Arnold I., King of France? Nothing is so rapid as a dream, nor so improbable. Montarbas had arrived at this preposterous conclusion ere he reached the outer courtyard of the palace. The sentries at the gate, who saluted him as he came in, were not yet relieved; but this French noble of a hundred ancestors, who had passed their post half-an-hour ago a haughty royalist, was already changed to a fierce, vindictive demagogue, only desirous of abandoning the sacred traditions of his race for a hope of impossible aggrandisement and unworthy revenge. He returned their stiff and soldierlike recognition with something of the good-fellowship that tends to relaxation of discipline; and the change had been wrought in five minutes, by no more complex machinery than a few thoughtless words from a woman, who was ever too prone to act on impulse in all she said and did. Count Arnold threw himself into his sledge, drew its furs up to his chin, and, notwithstanding these newborn predilections for liberty, equality, and fraternity, bade his coachman\nBREAKERS AHEAD.' 57 drive home to Paris, with a curse that honest fellow, waiting patiently in the cold, by no means deserved. Gliding softly through the streets of Versailles he could not fail to remark the discontent that prevailed amongst its poorer inhabitants."}, {"chunk": 26, "character": "Montarbas", "dialogue": "Is there any real fighting, Eugène? I thought I heard a shot fired just now, as I drove through the barrier?", "summary": "Montarbas encounters guards on the way to Versailles and questions Eugène about the presence of fighting.", "passage": "The good horse sprang to his master's voice and his master's hand. Ere Montarbas had ordered his coachman to drive on, Fitzgerald was nearly out of sight, galloping towards Versailles. To reach his hotel, the Count's nearest road lay through one of the principal streets of the capital. He was surprised, and perhaps, in his craving for fresh excitement, not displeased, to find its extremity occupied by a detachment of French guards, under command of an acquaintance, who courteously forbade him to pass. \"Is there any real fighting, Eugène ?\" asked Montarbas. \"I thought I heard a shot fired just now, as I drove through the barrier?” 66 \n\nThey are throwing about a few sugarplums,\" answered \n\nEugène, carelessly smoothing a young moustache. \"I have sent some wounded men to the rear. But it's nothing of\nROSINE. consequence; you can get to your hotel, Count, without inconvenience the other way.\" The other way meant a bystreet little frequented, but by foot-passengers. At the corner of this bystreet was a baker's shop, and at his own door stood the baker, white with flour, wild with rage and fear, trembling, gesticulating, pointing to his closed shutters, and trying to pacify a knot of people, that seemed gathering to a crowd. \"What do you desire, my friends ?\" urged the baker. \"You have no money-I have no bread! See, my shop is closed. How am I to make loaves without meal? How am \n\nI to heat the oven without firewood ?\" The mob increased every moment. Three or four men, ragged and coatless, who seemed to act in concert, moved through the midst. One of these put himself forward. \"Here is plenty of wood!\" said he, laying hold of the shutters. \"Let us have these down, citizens, and see if the little shopkeeper speaks truth!\" \"Well said, citizen!\" exclaimed a score of voices; while the crowd surged to and fro, every surge bringing them nearer the shop door. Its owner's courage was roused by a threatened destruction of his property, and, standing before his shutters, the baker made as if he would show fight. Then the ragged men closed in, hustling him back against his window, and one of them caught him by the throat. A woman's voice yelled out, \"Kill him, and have done with it! We are famished-we want bread for ourselves and our children!\" \"You have no children, Ton-ton!\" laughed a bricklayer in the crowd, who seemed to know this fury well. \"What matter? 'tis all one,\" was the shrill and savage answer. \"I am hungry, I am thirsty. I could eat a child\nmyself, and drink its blood. Down with the baker! He is an aristocrat in his heart.\" \"Down with the baker! down with all bakers!\" echoed the rioters, and a rush was made at the unhappy man, like the rush of wolves on their prey. At that moment the Count's sledge stopped within ten paces, while Father Ignatius, coming from the opposite direction, strode courageously through the mob to the baker's rescue, and wrenched his assailant's hand from the poor man's throat. He was not much too soon, the victim's brow had already turned black, and his eyes were beginning to roll. Cowed by the priest's prompt interference, the ruffian would have slunk back into the crowd, but that the sneer of a scavenger's boy, a half-naked imp in his teens, goaded him to assert himself. \"\"Tis thy director, Guillot,\" squeaked the urchin. \"Go down on thy knees then, my son, and he will give thee absolution.\" Thus stimulated, Guillot, who was more than half drunk, turned upon the priest, and demanded, with a hideous imprecation, \"who he was? and by what right he interfered ?\" \"By the right of my Master,\" answered Father Ignatius, in a loud, clear voice. \"I am his servant, and so are you.\" \"Down with all masters!\" yelled the crowd, \"down with the priests! down with the Church! down with all the world!\" But these clauses were somewhat too sweeping, especially for the female rioters, and presently a reaction setting in, several voices cried \"Long live the Church; long live the priest! Let the good father go his way.\""}, {"chunk": 27, "character": "Montarbas", "dialogue": "I know him! he speaks truth. I will answer for him with my life. He is no courtier, I tell you; I am sure of it. I, who speak to you. I was at Versailles an hour ago myself.", "summary": "Montarbas defends a priest before a mob, declares his loyalty, then publicly renounces his courtier status to align with the people.", "passage": "But again the little wretch in scavenger's rags must needs interfere. \"Priest!\" laughed this imp of mischief, \"he is no more a priest than I am. Look at him! Where are his\nROSINE. beads? Where is his breviary? He is a wolf in sheep's clothing. An aristocrat in disguise. Strip him, and you will find a court suit beneath his cassock.\" They circled round with a howl of rage, a score of dirty hands were already clutching at his dress, when the Father's eye met that of Montarbas standing upright in the sledge for a better view of this tumultuous scene. It betrayed neither fear nor wavering, yet was there something in it that appealed to the Count's manhood, and caused him to leap down with such energy as clove through the mob and brought him in three strides to the priest's side. \"I know him!\" he vociferated; \"he speaks truth. I will answer for him with my life. He is no courtier, I tell you; I am sure of it. I, who speak to you. I was at \n\nVersailles an hour ago myself.\" It seemed a bold avowal to such an audience at such a moment, but it produced the effect he desired. The rioters paused to parley, and let go of their victim, in whose arm \n\nMontarbas instantly linked his own. \"Then you are a courtier,\" they shouted, \"and you do not fear to confess it here in face of the sovereign people!\" \"Make your escape, Monsieur,\" whispered the Count in his companion's ear. \"I know how to manage this rabble. I will keep them in parley while you slip off unobserved.\" My son, you have saved a fellow-creature's life,\" answered the other, and glided unnoticed to the outskirts of the crowd. 66 \"I was a courtier this morning, citizens,\" said Montarbas, taking off his hat with the confident air of one who addresses a body of supporters. \"What I have seen to-day has determined me to be a courtier no longer. I belong to the people now. I am a citizen; a patriot. I am one of yourselves. See! I pull off my cross of St. Louis, and trample it under my feet.\" While he spoke he wrenched the decoration from his breast and threw it on the pavement. There rose a faint cheer of applause, quickly drowned in howls of scorn, hatred, and derision. \"Idiot!\" exclaimed a voice behind him, \"have you ten lives in your pocket, besides the one in your body, that you commit such follies? Enter then, in heaven's name, or you will be torn in pieces, for they think you are afraid of them now!\" Ere he could turn round he was pulled back through an oaken door, clamped in iron, that shut to with a bang. It was so strong and thick as to deaden the yells of rage and disappointment that filled the street, and he found himself in a dark passage holding a woman by the hand. CHAPTER VIII. THE WOLVERINE. Two slender fingers closed on the Count's wrist, and a low, clear voice whispered in his ear- \"Good! your pulse beats full and calm. We want leaders; you are of the right stuff to make them. Come upstairs with me.\" He mounted a few steps, still guided by the same hand, and passing through another door, less strongly fastened than the first, Montarbas found himself in a sufficiently wellfurnished apartment, face to face with the woman who had surely saved his life. His pulse, so steady in danger, throbbed wildly now, and he started with surprise, she was so like the queen! The same height, the same undulating figure, the same graceful carriage of the head and shoulders, nay, the same pure, transparent complexion, and wealth of soft brown hair. But here the resemblance ceased. Scanning her features attentively the Count observed that they were harder, if more finely cut, than those of Marie Antoinette. The mouth, with its compressed resolute lips, its strong white teeth, denoted savage energy and dauntless force of will, while the light grey eyes and keen-contracted pupils, betrayed under their languid eyelids the dormant ferocity of a beast of prey."}, {"chunk": 28, "character": "Count Arnold", "dialogue": "It is for you to dispose of me henceforth, Mademoiselle.

Yet was she a woman after all. She could not bear to see a handsome aristocrat, like Count Arnold, torn to pieces by the mob when it was in her power to save him with the turn of a finger. More especially as the tool seemed fitted to her purpose, and she promised herself some amusement in shaping it for future use. He was always polite. He stood uncovered on the threshold, and thanked her with a careless smile. \"It is for you to dispose of me henceforth, Mademoiselle,\" said he. \"You have saved me from death, and by all rules of warfare I belong to you, body and bones.\" Faint and far-off shouting could still be heard in the street. She raised her hand to bespeak his attention. \"Listen,\" she said, \"do you hear the roaring of the waves from which I extricated you? Do you believe they can be stemmed by a handful of cavalry and a company of Swiss guards ?\" 66 \"Not without a fieldpiece or two,\" he answered cynically. Scarcely, perhaps, by a park of artillery. Frankly, Mademoiselle, I think they will soon mount to a tide that shali sweep all before it.\" \"Do not call me Mademoiselle. I am a citizen. Arnold de Montarbas, I know your name.

You may lead me wherever you like now!\" \"Bah! you are talking nonsense, Count Arnold. Do you imagine I pulled you out of that turmoil by the ears, for the sake of your good looks?\" \"And my good character combined: yes, I rather flattered myself it was so, Mademoiselle. I beg pardon, Léonie.\" The tender inflection of voice as it dwelt on her name sank pleasantly in her ear. She might have known, had she reflected, how impossible it was for Montarbas to speak to any woman at any time, without giving her to understand that she had excited an interest in his feelings. \"You are jesting!\" she exclaimed, with a softer expression in her bright grey eyes, \"and I am in earnest. I am always in earnest, because I am ambitious. You too, are you not ambitious ?\" He looked very comely, she thought, this aristocrat, as he raised his head and his eyes brightened. \"Ambitious!\" he repeated. \"Yes, if ambition be the love of power. Not for its wealth: I have spent so much that it seems no hardship to be penniless. Not for its pomp: a king is none the more a king because his crown is carried before him on a cushion of red velvet. Not even for the fame it hands down to a generation I shall never know; but for its own sake, for gratification of the pride and selflove that would fain dispose of man's life and woman's honour, at the caprice of an irresponsible will.\" \"You are frank, Monsieur,\" she said, with a glance of admiration in the handsome, excited face. \"And the woman who could help you to this power, what would you give her in return ?\" \"What does one always give a woman in return for\nTHE WOLVERINE. 69 sacrifices?\" he laughed. \"Inconstancy, I suppose, and ingratitude.\" \"If I were the woman, you would never have the chance,\" she answered. \"You should die by my hand before I suffered you to play me false!\""}, {"chunk": 42, "character": "Montarbas", "dialogue": "Monsieur, in Her Majesty's presence I decline FOUL PLAY. 99 to exchange bad language with her brother-in-law.

Again chance favoured him, and again, till, in the true spirit of a gambler, with a shout of \"Soixante et le va!\" he hazarded all or none on the next card in the game. People said afterwards that the dealer's cheek paled, and his lip quivered, but his hand, at least, must have been steady, if amongst all those players watching every finger, only two detected a false movement that seemed to substitute the next card in succession for that which he ought to have turned up. \"Hold!\" exclaimed D'Artois, screaming with passion, \"you are cheating, Monsieur! Gentlemen, this is foul play!\" and he glared round on the company with blazing eyes like a wild beast. Montarbas, holding the cards firmly in his hand, looked him full in the face. \"Monsieur,\" said he, \"in Her Majesty's presence I decline\nFOUL PLAY. 99 to exchange bad language with her brother-in-law. I hold every gentleman here answerable for this shameful accusation.\" \"Hold me! I saw you do it,\" exclaimed a young man pushing forward from the crowd behind Count d'Artois. \"I repeat the words of Monseigneur, you are a cheat! you have swindled us all!\" In an access of indignation, if not real, then exceedingly well assumed, Montarbas dashed down his cards with a violence that scattered half the pack over the floor, so that it was impossible to count or sort them now. Then he turned on his new adversary, calm and firm, masking his anger in a wicked smile. \"I thank you, Marquis, for your good opinion; it is well worth the thrust of a sword. For to-morrow, then-the three firs in the Bois-at eight.\" \"The sooner the better,\" answered the other, retiring with a bow. But now arose a great confusion of tongues amongst the witnesses of this indecorous scene, which was enacted so rapidly that the Queen at the other end of the table did not make out exactly what had happened. Knowing the excitable temper of her brother-in-law, she set it down, indeed, to the impatience with which, in spite of their frequency, he accepted his losses; but those who discussed it were of a different opinion, the more so as the gains of the bank had been unusually heavy, and many were disposed to believe that they had been cheated all through. Play was suspended, the party broke into groups, and Montarbas found himself shunned as if he had the plague, with a duel for next morning on his hands. Turning from one to another he satisfied himself that the game was up. Henceforth he would no longer be tolerated by that class of society to which he belonged. In the mean- H 2\nROSINE. time the Marquis de Vaucourt was the finest swordsman in Europe, and where was he to provide himself with a second? Catching sight of Fitzgerald's tall figure stalking down a corridor he hurried after the Irishman, and implored his valuable assistance in so congenial an affair. The other looked kindly in his face- \"Did ye do it now?\" said he. \"I'll never believe it! If ye did, I'd have to run ye through the body myself. Anyhow, you should have asked me sooner, for I am engaged on the other side.”\nCHAPTER XII. FOUL FIGHTING. In spite of a cold wind and the chilly drizzling weather that so often attends the breaking up of winter and departure of snow, his blood felt hot and fevered, the flush of anger still burned in his cheek, when Count Arnold descended mechanically from his coach and entered the Hotel Montarbas like a man in a dream. At the door stood Léonie, cloaked and muffled, looking very pale and eager under her black satin hood, impatient to learn how he had sped. He would have passed without notice, so absorbed was he in the troubles gathering about him, but she laid her hand on his arm and peered anxiously in his face."}, {"chunk": 46, "character": "Count Arnold", "dialogue": "Monsieur will be my witness, without doubt.", "summary": "Montarbas and other nobles engage in a fencing duel with a mysterious stranger, while Count Arnold and the Marquis exchange words.", "passage": "Montarbas produced his snuffbox, and handing it to the Marquis, executed a profound and deferential bow. The other, accepting a pinch, returned the salute with a courtesy so elaborate as to border on the ludicrous. Neither uttered a syllable; not a sound was to be heard but the drip, drip, from the branches in the forest. Presently, one of the snufftakers sneezed, and the other looked at him. The situation was becoming ridiculous. At that moment a step fell softly on the saturated sward, and a cloaked figure, looming large and dim, approached them out of the fog. \"It is Fitzgerald!\" exclaimed the Marquis. \"It is Léonie's admirer!\" thought Montarbas. They had replaced their hats, but uncovered once more to the new arrival, and De Vaucourt, not recognising the figure, cursed his Irish friend more emphatically than ever in his heart. \"Monsieur will be my witness, without doubt,\" said Count\n\nArnold, no less impatient than his adversary. \"He will have the kindness to demand of the Marquis why he is here unaccompanied by a friend ?” \"Monsieur will inform Count Arnold de Montarbas,\" returned the Marquis, \"that I have been strangely and inexplicably disappointed. It is no fault of mine that I am\nVincent Brooks, Day & San Lith. Pl\n\nFOUL FIGHTING. 109 here unattended. No matter! we are men of honour. Monsieur will perhaps have the goodness to act for both ?\" The stranger bowed, without, however, removing the hat or cloak that were so worn as to conceal the features. \"You do me a great honour, gentlemen,\" was the reply. \"Under such unusual circumstances you will permit me to make my own arrangements, and to accommodate you in my own way.\" Montarbas started. Something in the voice reminded him of Coupe-tête-but, no; the figure was slighter, with black beard and moustache, and a shock of coarse black hair.\" \"Take your ground, gentlemen,\" continued this mysterious personage, drawing a long rapier, and scoring with its point a straight line on the sodden turf. \"You will neither of you put a foot forward beyond that mark, and you will be kind enough to fence over my sword. It is the way we fight in our country; and only on these conditions will I consent to act. On guard, if you please, gentlemen, and begin!\" They looked surprised; but threw cloaks and hats aside, drew, and placed themselves in position. The stranger, still wrapped up and muffled, with swordpoint resting on the mark at their feet, watched intently, every limb and sinew braced, as if in act to spring. Not an eyelash quivered, not a nerve appeared to wince, though the wicked blades gleamed and clashed within a sword's length, twining, eluding, thwarting each other in the nimble game of death. The men were good fencers. At first, there seemed little to choose between them; but De Vaucourt was reserving his strength till he could tempt his adversary into that mode of attack for which he had invented and practised his deadly return. In such contests, the slightest inferiority of skill must be supplemented by greater exertion. Montarbas felt his chest heaving and his muscles beginning to ache, while the\nROSINE. Marquis stood firm as a rock, his point steady, and his wrist like iron. With a skilful feint he drew the assault he wanted at last. Blown, baffled, bewildered, Montarbas launched a succession of wild and aimless passes that the Marquis parried closer and closer, till, disengaging for the last time, he was inside his adversary's blade, and had got him safe. But in its very thrust his point flew up, struck sharply from below, and a familiar voice, recognised even at that supreme moment, hissed in the Count's ear. \"Lunge, Arnold! Quick! Under his guard, and he's a dead man!\" The words were hardly spoken, when De Vaucourt went down with a deep groan, and half his adversary's blade, broken short off, sticking through his body. The stranger, tearing a mass of false hair from head, and cheeks, and chin, leaned on the shoulder of Montarbas, and burst into a passion of tears."}, {"chunk": 97, "character": "Montarbas", "dialogue": "To Versailles, then!

I accuse another criminal. Again I pause to hear your verdict. I charge a Bourbon with designs on the existence of his nation. I impeach Louis XVI. for treason to France!\" Again the turmoil roared and raged about him like a whirlwind. In the midst of it a voice was heard to exclaim, \"Prove it!\" and more than one hand clutched a hidden poniard, to bury it in the heart of an advocate bold enough to demand that even royalty should have a fair hearing in its defence. But the advocate was a creature of Arnold's, the interruption a mere dramatic situation to enhance the effect of his speech. \"A citizen requires proof,\" he said, his handsome features mantling with the smile of one who is confident he can demolish the argument of an adversary. \"That citizen is right. We are patient, we are logical, we take nothing for granted. The proof is contained in one single word. It lies in the Veto, which a tyrant refuses to resign.

Let us not be carried away by phrases, sentiments, expressions. Let us analyse the situation, reasoning calmly, exhaustively, without prejudice, like true citizens of France? Whence is this right of kings, that, while men believed in such follies, was called divine? Absurd! It emanates from the nation. The voice of the\nROSINE. people is the voice of destiny; the condemnation of the people is the decree of doom! How say you, Citizens: this\n\nLouis, hatching plots against his country, yonder at Versailles; is he guilty, or not guilty? Again a wild and furious uproar. \"Guilty! guilty!\" shouted, repeated, re-echoed, without a single dissentient. Montarbas, who had carried his hat in his hand, now placed it on his head. \"To Versailles, then!\" said he. \"When we have brought him back with us to Paris, the game will be our own!\" \"To Versailles ! To Versailles!\" The clamour within rose and swelled, till it drowned the clamour of the mob, vociferating the same war-cry without. To use a national expression, Paris had gone down into the streets, and a mighty volume, surging and swaying, at every outlet, moved steadily onwards, like a rising tide towards the Southern Barrier, while, dominating the confusion of the moment, a note of warning that struck chill to the boldest heart, clanged harsh and discordant overhead. The bells of Notre-Dame were tolling backwards to arouse the populace, and incite them to fresh outrage. Montarbas stopped the rush of his followers in the doorway with a motion of his hand. \"Listen!\" said he. \"Citizens, it is the tocsin. It is the death-knell !—the death-knell of monarchy in France!\" CHAPTER XXVI. THE TUCSIN. THE sun went down, like an earthly king, in robes of purple and gold, the crimson streaks of evening melted into a mild October night, and still, through the gathering darkness above rang out that threatening summons, as though some spirit of evil brooding over the city had broken his restraining fetters, and clashed their fragments together in unholy and malicious glee."}]}

I cannot do better than entrust her to Monsieur le Curé, and take my leave.\" The priest could have nothing to object, and Montarbas with a graceful farewell strode gaily off, turning for a last glance at Rosine ere a group of snow-coated trees hid him from her sight. Though walking demurely, with downcast eyes, beside her pastor, no doubt she marked the gesture, and understood perfectly what it meant. \"Rosine,\" asked her companion, in a stern, sad voice, 66 have you ever seen the Count before ? \" ROSINE. \"Never,\" said Rosine, \"or I am sure I should not have forgotten him. But why?\" The Curé meditated for a moment, muttering something like an invocation to heaven for aid. Then he looked in her handsome face and answered frankly— \"Because you are a good girl and pretty. He is a bad man and rich. I am a priest of holy Church. I am in charity with all the world. It is not for me to speak ill of my neighbour, far less to judge him by my own erring standard; but, Rosine, your soul is in my keeping no less than his, and I warn you, my child, to fly from that man as you would fly from one with a pestilent disease. Do not let him so much as touch the hem of your garment. Avoid his company. Keep out of the very air he breathes.\" The Curé, single-minded, ascetic, and enthusiastic, was one of those devoted servants whom the Church of Rome numbers by thousands in her ranks. Father Ignatius, a name by which he was known in the high places of the Vatican, as among the poor peasantry of Rambouillet and Fontainebleau, had done much missionary work in savage regions, converting the heathen at no small risk of life and limb, carrying out his instructions with unquestioning fidelity, and serving, as he believed, the good cause with a total forgetfulness and abnegation of self. Blind obedience, unflagging zeal, were the two pillars of his creed; and when an order came from his superiors, he accepted the charge of a few rude wood-cutters in a desolate forest of the provinces, neither more nor less willingly than he would have started at a moment's notice for Kamschatka or \n\nJapan. He was well read in the classics, thoroughly conversant with the history of his Church, a formidable disputant, a subtle controversialist, keen of perception, close in argument, fluent in language, pious enough for a martyr, wise enough\nTHE WOLF AT THE DOOR. 9 for a cardinal; but he knew as little of a woman's nature as a boy of fifteen! \"Is he really such a black sheep?\" said Rosine, opening her dark eyes wide. \"He does not look so very wicked; tell me then, my father, what has he done?\" \"My daughter,\" answered the priest, \"do not ask, neither your grandmother, nor Pierre, nor any one. You can trust me, and I say to you forget him as if you had never seen his face, make no mention of his name; and if people speak in your presence of Count Montarbas cross yourself and say in your heart, I do not know the man! I thank you, my daughter, but I will not enter now. I have half a league to walk yet. God be with you, Rosine, and goodnight.\" So Father Ignatius hurried on to comfort some dying sinner on a pallet of straw, satisfied he had given the girl good counsel to keep her out of harm. It never occurred to him that he might have woke in her heart the little imp of curiosity who, cradled in idleness and fed on interest, is capable of growing into a full-sized Cupid, and doing sad mischief with young men and maidens. Perhaps, if she had not been warned against him, she might never have thought about the Count again.

Ere she shut out the snowy landscape she gazed long and wistfully towards the forest, like one who waits for some one less expected than desired. \"What is it, Rosine?\" asked a woman's voice from the dark smoky fireplace within. \"Dost thou see anything unusual, my child?\" ROSINE. 66 'Nothing, grandmother,\" was the answer. \"Nothing but the big wolf's track close to the door. Some day he will get through, and what is to become of us then ?\" \"God forbid!\" replied the old woman, crossing herself. \"In that case I put my trust in Pierre.\" CHAPTER II. THE BALLE-MARIÉE. \"WHO calls me?\" said a deep kindly voice from the woodyard behind the cottage, where the chop, chop, of an axe denoted a thrifty provision of fuel against the severe weather that had set in. \"You have but to say the word, 'Pierre, come here,' my little one, and behold, Pierre it is!\" There was an assumption of carelessness in the speaker's manner as he stepped into the kitchen, that changed by ludicrous gradations to the uneasiness of a man who finds himself face to face with the woman he loves. Pierre tried to look as if Rosine were the last person he expected to seefailed egregiously-blushed-stammered, and finally held out his hand with an incoherent apology for the dirt accumulated by its honest labour. She took it graciously enough, and the kindly greeting in her dark eyes seemed to reassure him at once. He was a strapping young fellow, over six feet in height, with the frank, pleasant face that so often accompanies a stalwart frame and athletic proportions; scarcely handsome, but comely in the comeliness of upstanding manhood, while to women, who admire all qualities in extremes, there was something very pleasing in his noble stature and unusual physical strength. At leaping, running, wrestling, carrying a load, cutting down a tree, or shooting with ball, he was unequalled from Rambouillet to St. Cloud; yet a girl of\nROSINE. nineteen could turn him round her finger like a needleful of thread! \"Ah! mademoiselle,\" said he, with emotion, \"we were getting anxious about you in the storm. I have this moment finished cutting up your firewood, and should have been off to look for you the instant I had washed my hands.\" \"No need, Monsieur Pierre,\" answered Rosine. \"I can take good care of myself both indoors and out. I have long left off being a baby, though I am not quite so tall as you! She stood by him on tip-toe, and glanced up saucily in his face. \"And the big wolf,\" he said, looking down with a wistful tenderness on the delicate creature that vexed and soothed him every day in the week. \"Bah! the big wolf is no wiser than the rest of you. In five minutes I could coax him to follow me about like a man!\" \"Silence, my child!\" interrupted her grandmother, looking up from a pot-au-feu, the scaling of which wafted savoury odours through the kitchen; \"I cannot bear to hear you speak so in jest or in earnest. What do you know of wolves, or men either, for that matter? You should have been back an hour ago. I won't have you walking alone in the forest at sundown.\" Rosine shrugged her pretty shoulders. \"Content yourself, grandmother,\" she replied; \"I had an escort.\" 99 \"An escort!\" repeated the old woman, turning round, and wiping her bare arms on her apron. \"An escort!\" echoed Pierre, with a troubled brow and a piteous quiver about the lips. \"Well, is it so strange that a poor, lonely girl should meet with people kind enough to see her safe home in a snow-storm?

In her fright she thought it very pleasant and reassuring. \"Pierre, Maître Pierre!\" she exclaimed, as he rose from the table, do not be rash, do not expose yourself—you will not go out to him in such a cold as this?\" His only reply was a grim smile as he retired to the chimney-corner, whence he presently emerged with an awkward brass-mounted long-barrelled gun, a powder-horn ingeniously constructed to spill half its contents, and a handful of bullets, weighing more than an ounce a-piece. The grandmother, catching sight of these instruments, threw\nROSINE. herself into a high-backed chair, wrapped her apron round her head, and fingering her chaplet, began to score off the prayers of her church, bead by bead, with praiseworthy devotion and dexterity. \"Take care!\" exclaimed Rosine. \"Won't it go off?\" \"Not till it's loaded,\" said Pierre quietly. \"Sometimes, even then, not so soon as I could wish. Observe what I am doing-look, Rosine! May I call you Rosine ?\" \"Go on; don't stop to ask questions. He is scratching at the door. Oh, I'm so frightened!\" Pierre placed a brace of bullets in the palm of his left hand, and poured the coarse grains over them from his powder-horn till they were completely covered. His science of projectiles was rude, and the result only of his own experience, yet perhaps not so far wrong after all. With a confident smile he bade her watch his proceedings. \"Many people,\" said he, \"load one barrel with one ball; that is not my way, and I rarely miss my mark.\" \"Why do you put in two ?\" Resting its butt on his foot and caressing the barrel of his gun, Pierre explained his system with much solemnity. \"I learned it from the old forester who taught me to track a boar, trap a wolf, and get the wind of a deer. Ah! poor old Antoine! He died last autumn year, and I make no doubt he is with St. Hubert in paradise. But, Rosine, do you know what they call it ?\" \"Cruelty-murder-bloodshed. How can I tell ?\" 66 \n\nThey call it the balle-mariée. And, Rosine, there is a moral in this! Where each would fail singly, the two united succeed in effecting their purpose.

The wolf, whose hunger had been attested by the vehemence of his sniffings at the chinks in the cottage door, now commenced such a fierce attack with paws and teeth as the slender woodwork and frail latch seemed unlikely to resist. \"Mind Pierre!\" exclaimed Rosine, pale as death, but showing a bold front behind her lover; \"he will be in the house in less than a minute.\" \"That is sixty seconds,\" was his quiet reply-\"a long time when it is a question of taking aim, point blank.\" In her terror she was proud of him, standing there so cool, so collected, so confident.

To these she replied affably and goodhumouredly, nay, even in a tone of levity, on which her enemies put the worst construction, though her natural grace and dignity never failed to command respect, and he would have been a bold subject, even for a Frenchman, who had ventured to presume on Her Majesty's kind looks and brilliant smile. Tall and beautiful, she still retained that simplicity and charm of manner which so fascinated the nation when first they welcomed their Dauphin's young bride on the German frontier; but those deep grey eyes wore a sad and scared expression now: trouble and anxiety had carved their lines in that pure, pearl-like face, and threads of silver already streaked the profusion of rich brown hair, raised according to the fashion of the time, tier upon tier, above her forehead, surmounted by a superstructure of lace, gauze, and crimson velvet, lapped in a string of pearls worth more than a hundred thousand francs.

Enough, Monsieur le Marquis, you can pass on.\" She did understand, only too clearly, and her blood ran cold while she returned his low, devoted obeisance with majestic courtesy. The Marquis de Favras, young, chivalrous and romantic, but prescient of evils that older and wiser heads seemed to ignore, had set himself the task of forming a secret body-guard to watch over the safety of the royal family, prepared, at a moment's notice, to defend it with their lives. In this legion of honour were enrolled some of the noblest names in France, and at first, while the idea was fresh, and the enthusiasm of loyalty it called forth in the ascendant, prodigies of valour would, no doubt, have been performed on occasion, and these silken lords would have died by scores, like their ironclad ancestors, in the cause of their sovereign. But excitement is not valour, as fever is not strength. However exalted their rank, however noble\n\nE 2\nROSINE. their aim, good discipline, and, indeed, good pay, are required to keep together any body of men who have a common object in view; and without the backbone of strength and cohesion afforded by practical and judicious organisation, all such associations dwindle down to inefficiency, as snow melts in the sun, from a mere innate principle of decay. When Montarbas was canvassed as a promising young royalist to join this band of heroes, he asked two pertinent questions- \"Have you cannon, and a military chest?\""}, {"chunk": 32, "character": "Rosine", "dialogue": "Brava, my sister; you speak like Brutus in petticoats.

That she had fallen in love with Montarbas she would have been the first person indignantly to deny; yet did she not conceal from herself that she suffered from one symptom at least of the disorder-in keen pangs of jealousy when she looked on the face or heard the name of Rosine. Even an indifferent woman seems gifted with some faculty that discovers, as if by instinct, the inclination of her natural prey towards her natural enemy; but male duplicity has never yet succeeded in concealing from her who feels an interest in it, the interest its own ingratitude is base enough to feel in another. She had resolved to keep them apart. However uncertain seemed the future, on this point she would never waver; but\nthough a hard temperament and keen sense of the ludicrous afforded her a certain cynical amusement in thwarting the inquiries about the girl he was not ashamed to make in her presence, this pastime, like many other so-called pleasures in which the feelings are excited, was sadly qualified with pain. Nevertheless, by whatever means Count Arnold might succeed in hunting down poor innocent Rosine, she swore a great oath he should have no assistance from Léonie Armand. She used often to ridicule the power of love as compared with ambition. She was more than ever ambitious, she told herself of late, wilfully ignoring the consciousness that her ambition was now for him. She called it patriotism, good generalship, wise management, forethought, common sense. She never admitted it was a woman's merest weakness that bade her canvass, intrigue, deceive, move heaven and earth to make Montarbas a leader of that desperate faction which hoped ere long to be the governing power in France. He was so brave, she argued, so eloquent, so persuasive, so versatile, so reckless of consequences; above all, so eager to rise. In the Council, in the Chamber, in the field, when others shrank from action, he would come boldly to the front. He seemed born to be a leader, and it was her mission, she declared, so to guide him that he should not miss his destiny. \"Yes, my brother,\" she resumed, \"I have never ceased to insist that the man we want at the head of our party must possess brain, heart, courage, everything but conscience. We have been preparing our strength for weeks and months; it is time to prove it at last. This Assembly of ours will be no Parliament of the Middle Ages, convoked by a Bourbon to congratulate him on his sovereignty, fill his purse with gold, and dissolve when he puts on his hat.

It means millions and millions of \n\nFrenchmen, who are of the same race, the same interest, the same mind. We shall obtain a majority to swamp the priests and the courtiers by ten, twenty, a hundred to one!

Blood for supper, my pretty one, dost thou understand?", "summary": "Rosine confronts a frightened girl in the mob, warning her of danger and the blood for supper.", "passage": "It takes but a sprinkling of blood to render the populace fierce as wolves, while, like wolves, they encourage and infuriate one another. Soon a drum beats in some neighbouring square, the clatter of dragoons, the measured tramp of infantry, perhaps the roll of a six-pounder gives timely warning, and the crowd either melts like a snow-wreath or makes a futile resistance, that leaves a dozen of its least guilty members dead in the gutter, and a poor little child shot accidentally through the window, killed amongst its playthings on a nursery floor. There is nothing so unmanageable, so impulsive, so desperate, and yet so cowardly, as a mob. It has held its own, barefooted and half-armed, against the flower of regular troops, and it has been turned by a solitary sentry, scared by the pennon of a single lance. But the French are essentially a military nation, and a French mob is therefore so far formidable, that it usually contains a proportion of men, who, accustomed to act in concert, understand the necessity of mutual dependence and cohesion. On a bright morning in April, 1789, knots of people, belonging to the lowest of the lower classes, dotted the streets 1\nof Paris, obviously with some fixed intention, and under the guidance of certain leading spirits, who disposed them in different localities, systematically, and as it seemed, with a definite plan of operations. The material, though rough, was formidable, and less unwieldy than might have been expected. There were workmen and mechanics in large numbers, many of whom brought with them such of their tools as could be used for offensive weapons in a hand-tohand conflict, The butcher shouldered his cleaver, the carpenter his axe, the very tailor carried a pair of shears; and in one instance a little cobbler, more than half drunk, brandished an awl! Here and there some ruffian, whose only trade seemed blood, was armed with a worn-out musket, or a rusty pike; but these were evidently heads of their own little companies, and so to speak, sub-officers of the movement. While amongst them all, passing where they would, flitted Mother Carey's chickens, those birds of ill-omen, the\n\nParis fishwomen, welcomed on every side with shouts and cheers, and jests more pointed than decorous, which they returned in a spirit of ribaldry that made the ears of modesty tingle, and its blood run cold! Strapping furies, most of them were! powerful of lungs and limb, deep-bosomed, tanned and freckled, with brawny arms, fitter to strangle an enemy than girdle a lover, and voices husky from shouting, exposure, and drink. Some, indeed, of the younger portion who had pretensions to beauty, decked themselves out in satin dresses invariably black and of the costliest fabric; while all were so far feminine as to wear ornaments of some kind, and to keep their hair neatly arranged, the most ragged and the least sober amongst them priding herself on a pair of gold ear-rings, and a row of glossy braids, carefully pressed and flattened down. \"How now, chicken?\" exclaimed the busiest of them, a\nROSINE. hoarse, broad-shouldered virago, leering in the face of a shrinking girl, dressed in black, cowering under the arm of a tall robust man to whom she clung. \"What art thou doing here, little one, trussed up in a crowd like this? Go home, I tell thee, go home, and look after the soup. We mean no child's-play to-day. If thou art hungry thou shalt have blood for supper! Blood for supper, my pretty one, dost thou understand?\" \"Oh, Pierre! she frightens me,\" whispered the girl, pressing closer to her protector, and receiving this appetising invitation with pale cheeks and dark eyes full of terror. To Rosine the past had indeed been an eventful winter; one of change, excitement, grief, happiness, hardships, and consolations that only rendered her the more beautiful in the seal of thought and sentiment they set on her innocent face. Pierre, working like a horse, with a horse's strength and courage, earned such high wages from his first coming to Paris, as speedily provided a lodging good enough for his promised wife."}, {"chunk": 54, "character": "Rosine", "dialogue": "I am afraid.

Then came a necessary period of mourning, curtailed indeed by the exigencies of the situation, for, as Pierre urged, sensibly enough, it seemed now more than ever necessary to provide the girl with a protector and a home. Father Ignatius, too, put in a word, as did Léonie, notwithstanding her many vocations, and, perhaps, with secret reasons of her own. Rosine listened to advice, like a good girl, and did as she was told. Their marriage had been fixed to take place on the morrow, and in the meantime Pierre took her out for a walk in the fine spring weather, with that pleasant sense of holidaymaking nowhere so intense and so enjoyable as in France. It seemed annoying to be hemmed in a narrow street by\nthe crowd when they wanted to reach gardens and fields. Nevertheless, it was an enlivening scene, exciting, amusing, and, but for the language of the fishwomen, it would have been agreeable enough. Clinging to her protector, Rosine was further shielded by the portly figure of the lady who last addressed her, and who looked down into her face with a kind of pitying admiration, not devoid of amusement. \"You puzzle me, child,\" she said, after a protracted and unceremonious stare. \"I don't know what to make of eyes and delicate face. and delicate face.

Do you see that pole, little one, over the barber's shop? There will be a red cap hanging there directly. It is the signal; she won't be long after that.”\n\nNow curiosity, though the speciality of neither sex, is doubtless one of the few weaknesses to which women yield without a struggle. Rosine would have given a great deal to be safe at home. She feared the crowd, the confusion, the noise; mistrusted the position, and, above all, dreaded this awful woman at her side; but she could not resist the temptation of\nROSINE. waiting for the Wolverine, of watching her whom she had only known hitherto in the privacy of domestic life, exercising those functions of which she had heard her speak so proudly, swaying the mob with a word, raising, repressing, and directing the storm. \"Pierre,\" she whispered, \"I should like to stay here a little longer. I want to see what Léonie will do when she comes before all these people; must she make them a speech? I wonder how she will be dressed?\" and Pierre, confident in his own strength, feeling besides, that to-day, of all days, the lightest wish of his bride must be law, seemed content to remain where he was. In less than half-an-hour the crowd, that had been gathering volume from every adjoining street and inlet, surged and swayed in one of those waves that denote a new impulse, a fresh excitement. But for Pierre's strong arm it would have lifted Rosine off her feet. \"Look!\" exclaimed the fishwoman, with a push of her huge elbow. \"Did I not tell you so? Tremble, tyrants! That is the cap of liberty!\" An unsavoury woollen cap, crimson rather than scarlet, now dangled from the barber's pole."}, {"chunk": 62, "character": "Rosine", "dialogue": "\"Dame! but I thought it was all over when I brought thee home.

By the exertion of certain devoted royalists, such as the Marquis de Favras, a few scattered troops were called in from the frontier to strengthen the slender garrisons of Paris and Versailles. Thus it fell out, that the regiment of Flanders, after a brush with the rioters in the capital, was ordered to change its quarters, for the immediate protection of the King. If, to the eye of discipline, they straggle somewhat loosely from their ranks, French soldiers are, of all others, the merriest on the march. These formed no exception to the rule. They sang, they smoked, they jested, they shared mouldy biscuit from their havresacks and sour wine from their canteens; but the morsel was nibbled with a joke, the mouthful sipped with a laugh. They seemed boys out of school rather than bearded men whose trade it was to look on death; and in their midst plodded Pierre Legros, his hands tied, his eyes fixed on the ground, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, marking nothing, like one whose doom has gone forth, and whose spirit is already hovering on the border of another world. CHAPTER XVII. MOTHER REDCAP. WHEN Rosine recovered consciousness, she found herself in the dark, stretched on a couch, thirsty and exhausted, very sore, very stiff, but otherwise not much the worse for the ordeal she had passed through. Her senses, returning gradually, as to one who wakes from a profound sleep, told her that she was not yet, as she at first believed, an inmate of the tomb. Death could never smell so strong of fish, and it seemed impossible to suppose that the other world, whether paradise or purgatory, was an abode the least like this! A handkerchief steeped in some cooling liquid, compressed her brows, the laces of her dress had been loosened, and a pillow from which the straw protruded was placed under her head. Experiencing a drowsy sense of rest after labour, ease after pain, she felt comfortable rather than otherwise, and indisposed even for the exertion of trying to recall the past. It was enough to hold some vague remembrance of a crowd swimming before her eyes, of a sea roaring in her ears, of a sentence spoken by Pierre that her failing senses forbade her to take in, and a hoarse, hateful voice, dominating all other noises, that seemed to mock and jeer at her distress. In her weariness she would have sunk to sleep, but that the same harsh tones, holding forth in an apartment below, roused her to wakefulness, memory, and the use of all her faculties, sharpened by a keen sense of fear. ROSINE. The smell of fish was presently accounted for, by the wet flap of some flabby substance repeated at intervals on a slab, which served to point and set off, as it were, the dealer's discourse with customers and friends. Rosine took in the situation at a flash. She was in the fishwomen's quarter, at the very centre of the insurrection—an inmate, a prisoner, perhaps a victim in Mère Boufflon's house. She had scarcely time to realise her position when a heavy foot was heard on the stairs, the door opened, and a large figure loomed through the obscurity, treading softly, with an air of ludicrous precaution, like an elephant trying the ground over which it has to pass. \"Dost thou feel better, my pretty one?\" asked the voice \n\nRosine so dreaded, while Mère Boufflon opened a shutter to throw some light on her patient. \"Dame! but I thought it was all over when I brought thee home.

Why, the very street urchins, the little patriots of the gutter, only know me as \n\nMother Redcap. Shall I tell you how I earned the name?

A ball struck\nMOTHER REDCAP. 147 me on the head-here; you can feel the scar, touch it, little one, don't be afraid; but Mère Boufflon wasn't likely to stop for such a fleabite as that. I let the blood cake on and plaster the wound, till friends and foes believed I was fighting in a man's nightcap for luck. 'Aim at the woman in the red cap!' cried the soldiers. \"Follow the woman in the red cap!' answered our people; and Mother Redcap I am called in the quarter to this day. Am I proud of it? No. These are follies. Wait a little, we have seen only child'splay yet. In the meantime, art thou not in pain, my dove? art thou not sore and bruised? Call me mother, then, that \n\nI may soothe and cherish thee, and keep thee here till thou art healed, lively as a sea-trout, and sound as a roach!\" Coarse, foul as she seemed, smelling of garlic, fish, and brandy, there was yet a tenderness in the woman's manner that emboldened Rosine to ask the question nearest her heart. \"And Pierre ?\" she murmured. \"My-my companion, who took care of me. What became of Pierre ?\" Hold ! I have it. Thou\n\nOur Count-the people's shall see thee to-morrow, “Bah! Let him go to all the devils, your Pierre!

Thou shalt chose from the very pick of the patriots. shalt marry Citizen Montarbas. Count. That is an idea! He when the colour has come back to thy cheeks. Thou art pale to-day and tired, no doubt. Look here; I will leave thee to rest now, and they may burn the fishmarket down ere I let them wake thee, till thou hast had thy sleep out. What! I have brought up children of my own. If I believed she could hear, I would thank the Virgin that not one of them is alive to see me now!”\n\nWhen the door had shut on her huge bloated form, Rosine L 2\nROSINE. leaped from the couch in an access of unreasoning terror that prompted her, like the instinct of a wild animal, to some mere physical struggle for escape. She looked from the window, it was on a second floor, and twenty feet from the ground. She examined the door, it was thick, strong, and locked on the outside. Then she lay down again, and reviewed the situation. Obviously nothing could be accomplished by force. She must use her wits, she must trust to chance, above all, she must gain time. After baffling the Count so effectually, it was maddening to think that she might become his prey at last. She wondered whether he remembered her still. Impossible! He must have abandoned the pursuit long ago. This dreadful old woman was only talking at random. Well, happen what might, she was resolved he should not find her here. No; if worst came to worst, as he entered the door, she would leap from the window and take her chance. What had she done to deserve this cruel persecution?"}, {"chunk": 66, "character": "ROSINE", "dialogue": "I understand. The aristocrat broke her heart.

We had better have prayed to Santerre, and your brother Coupe-tête, and the Jacobins in their club! See how it finished! There lived a Marquis in the next street. The dead wall of his hotel kept light and air from our humble little home. We might not draw water for our household till his stables had\nMOTHER REDCAP. 153 been supplied. That was not enough! He was a man of middle age. He had a wife and children of his own. mistress, too, in the suburbs. What do I know? Perhaps a score of intrigues all over the town. And he saw my pretty Margot going to the mass! He went there too, regularly, morning after morning. To the mass, Madame, do you understand? Our friends the Sansculottes are bad enough, but they are honest devils. Jet black and smelling frankly of sulphur. They never went to the mass! No! I learned the whole story afterwards, when it was too late. You have been a young girl, Madame, and so have I, though it seems impossible now. Need I tell you how these things accomplish themselves in spite of mother, neighbours, the \n\nVirgin, and all the saints? The man watches and the woman waits. A look accepted and returned; a blush—a smile-a flower, or a knot of ribbon begged, refused, accorded. It is all over then, and there is nothing more to be said. My girl had a fan she seemed to prize highly, declaring she bought it, with her own earnings, in the market. I ought to have known better. She had never deceived me before, and I should have seen she was telling a lie, because she turned so red! Poor Margot! She was pale enough when I kissed her dead lips, and bade her goodbye for ever. If it's true they will never let me get to her over there if it's all a fable, what matter? Everything must come to an end! \"Will you laugh at Mother Redcap now? Do you wonder that I am so fierce, and so merry too, when I hear churchbells ringing backwards, and the rattle of drums, behind a storm of file-firing that wastes itself against the barricade. Ah! that beats all the brandy in the Fishmarket! That makes the blood mount to my head, and I can forget Margot though she was the last of my children, though I laid her and her dead baby in the same grave with my own hands!\" ROSINE. There was something of pity on the Wolverine's clear, handsome face, but more of scorn. \"I understand,\" said she. \"The aristocrat broke her heart. And your Marquis, what became of him?” \"Died peaceably in his bed!\" replied the other. \"Priest, notary, doctor, all regular as clockwork. And the chisel never broke that scored lies on his tombstone! Had he only lived a little longer, only till now! I would have cut his throat with my fishknife, and lapped a mouthful of his blood! Enough! I have told my tale. I am out of breath -give me some brandy-just a little taste. Excuse me, Madame, I feel better now. With your permission, I am wholly at your service, and ready to attend to business!\" The Wolverine shuddered. She felt like a tamer of wild beasts after some crisis, during which the quiver of a nerve, the falter of an eyelash, might have changed the balance of power, and destroyed in a second the dominion of intellect over brute force. But these were the tools with which she had to work, and she must make the best of them. Hers was no unskilful touch, and the very sharpness that rendered them so dangerous to a bungler, was the quality she most prized."}, {"chunk": 77, "character": "Rosine", "dialogue": "But I am so afraid of that old woman below! Mother Redcap will never let me go away like this.", "summary": "Rosine expresses fear of Mother Redcap, and the Wolverine reassures her as they move through the shop.", "passage": "She was shrewd enough to trust the Wolverine's jealousy for her escape, and while she crouched trembling on the floor, racked her brain to devise\nhow best she could obtain access to Her Majesty when she had traversed the three and a half leagues that intervened between Paris and Versailles. She never doubted but that she would be a free agent if she could only get clear of Mother Redcap's shop and the odious neighbourhood of the Fishmarket. There would be nothing then to prevent her reaching the palace before daybreak, and for her loyal purpose any time in the morning would be soon enough. Therefore did her heart sink cruelly when Léonie, holding her affectionately by the arm, desired her to have no fear, as she herself would be answerable for the safety of Pierre's betrothed, and would lodge her through the night. \"But I am so afraid of that old woman below!\" whispered \n\nRosine. \"Mother Redcap will never let me go away like this.\" \"Mother Redcap has drunk brandy enough to agree to anything,\" answered the Wolverine, hurrying her captive downstairs, and passing with her through the shop, where indeed the old fishwoman's snores attested the depth of her slumbers. She started up, however, before they reached the street, displaying an activity no less unwelcome than unexpected, and placed her great body in the doorway, while, with an obstinacy provokingly affectionate, she absolutely forbade their departure. Folding Rosine in an alcoholic embrace, she forced them both to sit down; then poured out glasses of brandy, and insisted that each should at least touch the liquour with her lips, pledging them heartily herself, and waking up under the renewed stimulant, to an energy that was almost sober, compared with her late insensibility. She seemed to have some glimmerings of a wedding to be celebrated, and a drinking-bout arranged, but was hazy and confused as to the\nROSINE. identity of the bride, declaring more than once, that she was going to be married herself. Waiting till these last flashes of intelligence should go out like a candle, Rosine lost heart, and her companion patience, at the entrance of some half-dozen fishwomen, dropping in to spend the evening in a friendly way, and sipping, each of them, at the comfortable little dram, so readily offered and accepted, as if they were in no hurry to take their leave. All seemed to know the Wolverine, greeting her with inconvenient and overpowering enthusiasm. Rosine did not fail to observe that Léonie's hold over these furies was of a very fragile nature. She could guide them with a thread, but it must be in the way they chose to go themselves, and the Wolverine, whose courage had passed into a proverb when leading them by hundreds, did not dare now to thwart a mere handful of them in their drink. They accepted the girl at once as the friend of their friend, smothering her with unsavoury caresses, and pressing, almost forcing on her, the brandy of which the fumes already made her sick. She never forgot that night. It seemed to her that purgatory, when she came to it, would be far preferable to such a hell on earth. Ribaldry, blasphemy, horrible songs, combining the grossest indecency, the most daring impiety, with a fiendish kind of wit, threats to intimidate the aristocracy, and even the middle classes, libels on all that was best and noblest and purest in France, curses for the Church, ridicule of the King, and vows of vengeance that made her blood run cold, against the Queen! It was long past midnight ere the odious din sank into drunken stupor, and Rosine, with her protectress, escaped into the cool moonlight of the streets. Mother Redcap had relapsed into complete insensibility, and though two strapping fishwomen swore they would\nTHE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS.\" 179 escort their favourite home, the change from a heated atmosphere to the outward air, acted so irresistibly on the brandy they had swallowed, that each subsided on her own stall as she passed through the market, to sleep there tranquilly enough till morning. \"Are you not tired to death, little one?\""}, {"chunk": 78, "character": "Rosine", "dialogue": "Not in my legs, but in my head; yet still more, I think, in my heart. And you?", "summary": "Rosine, Léonie, and the Wolverine discuss their plans to enter a church while reflecting on revolutionary hardships.", "passage": "asked Léonie, who, while she accepted them as necessary evils of her position, regarded these revolutionary orgies with intense loathing and abhorrence. \"We have but to cross the square, traverse one street, and we shall be at home.\" \"Not in my legs,\" answered Rosine, wearily, \"but in my head; yet still more, I think, in my heart. And you?\" \"For me, I am never tired,\" answered the Wolverine; and she spoke truth. That frame of steel, those nerves of iron could defy even such an ordeal of the feelings and senses as she had passed through since sunset and retain their strength and elasticity undefeated still. The pair were passing under the church of Our Lady of \n\nSorrows. Rosine, looking hopelessly upward at the stone fretwork of its shafts and pinnacles, beautiful and delicate in the moonlight, as if wrought in ivory or lace, accepted, like a revelation from heaven, the idea that crossed her mind. \"It is open all night,\" she said, pointing to the quiet solemn porch; \"I have gone through much to frighten and distress me, it will do me good to run in and say my prayers to the \n\nVirgin. Will you come with me, Léonie, or-or wait outside ?\" She was pious and faithful, this dark-eyed peasant-girl, and her church enjoins proselytism at all times, under all circumstances, yet would she have felt sadly disappointed to find her friend as good a Catholic as herself. The Wolverine shrugged her shoulders. \"The Virgin and I do not visit,\" she said, with a mocking smile; \"but you can present my compliments to her if you\n\nN 2\nROSINE. like. Do not look distressed little one. If \n\nIf your superstitions amuse you, go and practise them; but be quick about it. We are close on daybreak, and the morning air strikes chill when one has been up all night.\" Rosine, dipping her fingers and crossing herself, as she entered the building, was pleased to find she was not its only occupant. A score of women at least were scattered here and there amongst the branching pillars and lofty arches of its majestic aisles, kneeling humbly, muttering inaudibly, and, notwithstanding the interruption of many wandering thoughts and worldly interests, we will hope, praying sincerely. A thrill of joy came over her, when she remembered that\n\nFather Ignatius officiated in this very church. Surely he could extricate her from her difficulties. She was bred a village maiden, and he had been her parish priest. She believed in him as a Mussulman believes in his prophet, a \n\nNegro in his fetiche, or an English gentleman in his solicitor! If she prayed to the Virgin at all, it was that she might come across Father Ignatius without delay. A lamp was glimmering feebly under the low arches that formed a recess containing the tomb of a constable of France: a dark figure passed between her and the light. Our Lady be praised! it was his whom she sought! In a moment her hand was on the sleeve of his cassock, while her voice murmured in his ear- 66 \n\nHelp, help, my father! I am in the last extremity of despair!\" He bent his head to listen, with the calm commiserating air of one to whom no phase of human sin and suffering is unknown. \"My daughter,\" he said, \" despair cannot enter here. The good Catholic leaves her sorrows at the church door. If you have sinned, make atonement with confession; if you are\n\nMK \n\nVincent Brooks\nsuffering, accept your chastisement with prayer. Look around you, every one of these penitents is in the same plight as yours.\" \"But, my father, I implored the Virgin that I might find you, and she has granted my petition. You alone can help me!

Here you cannot be overheard, and may unburden your mind safe and secret as in the confessional.\" Then out it all came-the story of her capture, her imprisonment, her feigned sleep; the manner in which she had learned the conspiracy of the fishwomen, and their bloodthirsty designs against the Queen; impressing on him at the same time that her movements were watched by the least scrupulous of the revolutionists, then waiting her return at the church door, urging him to further her escape and put her on the road to Versailles without a moment's delay. He pulled a small ink-horn, a pen and a scrap of paper from under his cassock, and wrote a few lines by the light of the dim and dying lamp to one of the Queen's waiting-women, apparently so unimportant as not to compromise the bearer: a simple request that she might be admitted in the palace to take patterns for some dresses ordered from Paris à la\nROSINE. Carmagnole, and approved of by the citizens as the latest novelty in costume. \"Tell the officer on duty you had it direct from Father \n\nIgnatius,\" said he, placing the note in Rosine's hand, “and he will pass you up the private staircase. My daughter, you are bound on a sacred errand, and heaven will guide your steps. Now come with me.\" He led her through a low door, hideously suggestive of the nun's fate who must expiate broken vows by lingering penance, walled up for ever in a living tomb, down a winding stair, along a crypt wherein a cunning transparency reproduced the awful scene of Friday night on Calvary; and pushing aside a rusty iron grating, took her up some mossgrown steps into a convent garden, where already the little birds were praising God for morning, in faint melodious twitters among the leaves. With a whispered benediction, he let her through the narrow wicket, and Rosine found herself in a street that she knew was at least a quarter of a mile from the porch by which she had entered the church. Though submitting willingly enough to the restrictions of a virtuous and well-brought up girlhood, she had never yet experienced that coercion by main force which makes the real bitterness of captivity, had never realised how dear was liberty till she thus regained it at a moment when so much depended on her exertions. \"You will tell Pierre I am safe,\" were the last words she whispered to Father Ignatius, as the wicket closed, and his quiet nod of assent re-assured her more than a hundred protestations. She knew she could depend on the good priest, and danced, rather than walked along the pavement, with that feeling of exhilaration, which is but re-action after nervous depression, which is accepted for an omen of victory, and which so often turns out to be the forerunner of humiliation and defeat. \"Versailles,\" she said, to herself, \"is scarcely four good\nleagues off, after all. I thank the Virgin for my peasantbreeding, my active legs and feet. I can reach it in four hours at most. Courage! I will die rather than give in!\" And the Wolverine waiting at the porch of Our Lady of Sorrows, in whose mission of holy love and mercy she seemed to have no part, shivered with cold and weariness, glancing in wistful longing, yet stubborn, self-willed scorn at the lofty cross already reddened by the first beams of a morning sky, wondering vaguely, sadly, bitterly, if peace might be found anywhere, and if this or that was the Truth!"}, {"chunk": 81, "character": "Rosine", "dialogue": "Pierre!

Before, however, she could appeal to the officer in command of the detachment, or even a sergeant, who hastened forward to examine this unexpected prize, a cloud of dust rose from the midst of the column, there came a shout, an oath, a scuffling of feet, and Pierre, handcuffed as he was, shook himself free, in a mighty effort, from the men told off to guard him, one of whom he tripped up, while with a push he sent the other reeling to the ground, and ran forward to rescue the woman he loved, tearing at his manacles with a strength that seemed capable of rending into fragments the very iron round his wrists. \"Pierre!\" exclaimed Rosine, stretching out her arms, like a child when it sees its nurse. \"Oh, Pierre! I have been so frightened, and I am so tired! But I am content now since I have got thee back!\" Then her head drooped, and she fainted. But for Antoine's arm, which had never quitted her waist, she must have fallen on the stones. The scene would have formed a quaint little picture in that dusty, ill-paved road, beneath its double avenue of trees. Brown faces and white teeth, blue coats, red lappets, pipeclayed cross-belts, and gleaming firelocks gathered round that pale prostrate girl, resting her head, like a broken lily, on Antoine's martial young breast; a war-worn sergeant stooping over her to offer an oval tin canteen, and a handcuffed giant, looking down with the stupefied air of a man just waking from profound sleep; on either side the flat,\nROSINE. smiling fields of sunny France, and above the quiveri poplars that changed their lights and shadows at the faint breath, as they fluttered, grey and gleaming, against t summer sky. \"Steady, men!\" exclaimed the sergeant, straighteni himself bolt upright with a rattle of his firelock, \"Here the captain!

The soldiers looked in each others' faces, murmuring \"Well said! But this is a girl of courage. One can trust her under fire. She stands firm to her colours. I would give a day's pay to marry her myself.\" The captain whispered with his sergeant. It was his duty to be cautious, and mistrustful of his better feelings, more especially of his natural prejudice in favour of a pretty face. Pierre had been taken, not red-handed, indeed, nor even red-capped, but under such circumstances as made it extremely probable that he had assumed a leading part amongst the rioters. His fine stature, his personal strength, the ease with which he had broken from his escort, and his dumb obstinacy in the guardroom, seemed all so many counts in the indictment against him, as a revolutionist and a Sansculotte. When they joined head-quarters, thought the Captain, a courtmartial must decide; but in the meantime, if this girl were really the prisoner's promised wife she would be conversant with all the secrets of their party, and had better share his confinement. 66 \n\nMademoiselle,\" said he, politely enough, \"I cannot let you go all this must be reported to the Colonel. In the meantime my men shall not molest you, and if you like alongside the prisoner.\" you shall march \n\nShe thanked him with a grateful look from her dark eyes, that nearly made him change his mind and take care of her himself, but the instincts of the soldier prevailed, and he told off four men from his company as a special guard for the prisoners. Amongst them was the old soldier whose comrade had first detected the hiding-place of Rosine. He was, perhaps, the only man present whose heart remained unsoftened by the girl's beauty and distress. If he had no pity to spare for her, however, his commiseration for Pierre,\nROSINE. whose strength and stature had already won his good-w increased mightily, while he learned how this stalwart sp men of manhood was about to become the prey of a natu enemy. When the sergeant asked, as a matter of form, whether prisoners should be manacled together, and his officer repli somewhat hastily, in the negative, this confirmed wom hater could not forbear exclaiming, \"Right, my capta \n\nLet him be free while he may! If he has not the g fortune to be shot he will be handcuffed to her all the of his life!\" CHAPTER XXII. A CAT MAY LOOK AT A KING. ROSINE's strength seemed to come back in the very happiness of proximity to her lover. The soldiers, with rough kindness, had forced on both a morsel or two of bread and a few sips of wine. Thus refreshed, they marched into Versailles with renewed bodily energy, and consequently in a more hopeful state of mind, relating by turns the sufferings and adventures that had befallen each.

Nevertheless, when a sentry's challenge, and the order \"Guard turn out,\" at the palace-gates welcomed the arrival of her captors, she observed with dismay that the Flemish horses of state were harnessed; the gaudy, glittering coaches stood in readiness; a handful of lancers had mounted for escort duty; a band played under the windows; footmen with pink silk stockings and gold-laced coats thronged the entrance; pages, in court dress, hurried to and fro; a scarlet cloth was rolled out on the doorsteps, and everything denoted the bustle of a royal departure.

It told own tale. There was no need of dusty shoes, travel-w dress, nor drooping figure to attest anxiety, suffering, a fatigue. \"I will charge myself with this affair,\" said\n\nCaptain de Girard, I relieve you of your prisoner. As y see, I am field officer of the day.\" 66 Rosine was waiting her opportunity. It had come at la \"Monsieur,\" she said, drawing the paper from her boso \"Here is a letter for you, from Father Ignatius.\" He started, and his face became very grave and thought while he read it. \"Captain de Girard,\" said he, \"keep yo\ndetachment under arms till further orders; double your sentries, and place a subaltern's guard at each of the gates; then bid the Colonel of D'Aiguillon's Lancers saddle, and be ready to turn out at a moment's notice. Tell the officer in command of the escort to dismount his men—and, Mademoiselle, be kind enough to come with me.\" While the young Captain hurried off to fulfil these instructions, Rosine followed the Marquis into the palace, through a side door, up a narrow staircase, along a corridor, lined with portraits of French royalties, and found herself ushered, with a quaking heart, into the private apartments of the King. She heard a step in the adjoining room, a cough, the opening of a door, and, for one moment, almost wished she had never come on so alarming an errand.

Bah! they w sweep the Sansculottes into the Seine. Do your duty, Marc if you please. There is nothing more to be said.\" The King looked from one to the other in consider perturbation. He thought it time to interpose. \"My wife,\" he exclaimed, \"my dear wife, be persua to stay at home. For the sake of your children, for the s of your husband.

The shrieks, the strugg the suffocation, the poor women and children trodden un foot, crushed and mangled, like grapes in a winepress. Madame, as you hope for heaven, do not go into Pa to-day!\" On the Queen's armour of courage and resolution, not far removed from obstinacy, the consideration of personal risk insisted on by the Marquis made not the slightest impression; but her husband's affectionate entreaties penetrated its joints, and Rosine's appeal went to her heart. Though she would have looked on fair fighting as calmly as the boldest of her ancestors, she could not bear to think that the innocent might suffer with the guilty, or that women and children should be sacrificed on her behalf. \"I will do as your\n\nMajesty pleases,\" she said, turning to the King with an air of displeasure, that gave De Favras to understand he was out of favour, as having offered advice contrary to her inclinations, for her own safety. \"If you wish me to remain with you, I can put off my visit to Paris, without inconvenience; and the Marquis, who seems chief in authority here, may dismiss my people at once.\" De Favras bowed low, with an expression of intense relief, and her heart smote her that she could even have looked unkindly at so faithful a servant. Ere he left the room she recalled him with a movement of her proud head. \"You may kiss my hand, Marquis,\" she said, graciously. \"I believe you value my little finger above your own life and the lives of all your race.\" A tear fell on the white hand as he bent over it, and the officer of the day went from her presence, vowing, as he had often vowed before, that now and ever, his whole existence should be consecrated to his Queen."}, {"chunk": 88, "character": "ROSINE", "dialogue": "Can we vex the heart we love?

As the wine went round they spoke of the royal family, especially of Marie Antoinette, in terms of such boundless devotion that their captain thought it a fitting opportunity to quit the table, and repairing to the royal apartments, entreat their Majesties, if only for a few minutes, to gratify his brother officers with their presence, and receive in person that ovation of which the acclamations reached them where they sat. The King loved nothing better than to see people happy, and to the daughter of Maria Theresa, with the traditions of her line, and her own deep earnest German sympathies, such a request seemed impossible to refuse. Following her husband, and carrying the dauphin in her arms, she came with her stately step into the banqueting-room, to meet such a reception as never greeted queen or woman before or since; no, not even in those bright days when the beautiful young arch-duchess crossed the frontier of France to become a bride. Glasses clinked, voices shouted, hats were flourished and flung to the roof; swords were drawn, and pointed to the skies; men laughed, wept, embraced; and ladies, trembling, sobbing, leaning over the boxes, used their handkerchiefs, alternately to wave their welcome, and to dry their tears. It was an intoxication, a whirlwind, a paroxysm of delirium that caught like wildfire, that was as difficult to guide or check, that created as much confusion in as short a time, and that died out, alas! rapidly and inexplicably as it spread. While she crossed the threshold their band struck up a favourite air of the day, called \"Peut-on affliger ce qu'on aime?\" and when the burst, with which this allusion was received, had somewhat subsided, the Marquis de Vaucourt,\nROSINE. now recovered from his wounds, fixed his eyes on Her Majesty, and sang the following lines in his mellow young voice, with a meaning and expression of which none present could miss the force nor the application :— \"Can we vex the heart we love?

No-no! \"When we vex the heart we love- \n\nPang all other pangs above! \"Tis because of Love's excess- \n\nLoving more, not loving less! Yes--yes! Yes-yes! And now the excitement reached its height. Guests, spectators, men and women, the very musicians, joined in chorus. Some officers of the National Guard in the boxes turned inwards the red and blue of their tri-coloured cockades, so as to show nothing but white. It was the badge of the Bourbons, and everything available was converted into a white cockade on the spot. Ladies tore their handkerchiefs, their lappets, the trimmings of their dress, and made them up into the required shape. Officers scaled the boxes and received these decorations on the points of their swords. A moment ago the lives of all present were at the disposal of the Queen, now they asked no better than to die for the white cockade! Her Majesty's feelings overcame her, and the firmness that could face insult, outrage, the last extremity of personal danger, so far gave way, under these overpowering demonstrations of attachment, that she was forced to retire with her handkerchief to her eyes."}, {"chunk": 105, "character": "ROSINE", "dialogue": "Look!

Not the quiver of an eyelash betrayed fear of their naked steel. \"I warn you,\" he resumed, \"I implore you.\" \"Strike, comrade!\" exclaimed the farther ruffian; and the nearer buried his weapon in the good man's body at a thrust. His eyes rolled; his jaw dropped; blood spouted over his cassock, and he staggered where he stood; but he made shift to hold the cross up in his murderer's face.

Pierre went back to the guardroom; Rosine, who had stolen out to bid him farewell, returned to her station near the Queen. It had been a hideous night-watch. Dawn was breaking at last, but failed to bring those rays of hope and comfort which it seems so natural to associate with the approach of R 2\nROSINE. day.

How gladly would she give her life for theirs, and, when worst came to worst die boldly and with honour, doomed indeed and defeated, but guiltless and undisgraced. In the meantime she had provided for the future of her humble friends. There was money and money's worth enough in the packet to secure them a competency for life. She laid express commands in her letter, on the person to whom it was addressed, that neither Pierre nor Rosine should be permitted to return to France till the troubles were over, and Liberty had ceased to walk abroad with a red cap on her head and a knife streaming with blood in her right hand.

A cottager, working in his garden, and nearly gored to death by a hunted stag, she supported on her own knee, bandaged with her own hands, and pensioned for life at her own expense. The officer of the day, moving a cabinet by her desire, in the young Queen's apartments, bruised his temples inadvertently, with such violence as to draw blood. The whole Court was shocked to learn that the first lady in France had condescended to wait on the sufferer, and herself administer relief; but the people out-ofdoors hailed such royal condescension with acclamations of enthusiasm and delight. She was no \"accursed Austrian \" then; but \"their pride, their darling, their favourite child, their good young Queen, beautiful and beloved!\" She had been married some few years before there seemed any promise of an heir to the throne; nevertheless, the fishwomen of Paris, who at first took her under their special patronage, used to vow that Nature intended her to be a mother, she seemed so fond of children, for she would notice even dirty little vagabonds playing in the street. It fell out that on one occasion her horses were pulled up with their noses over the very head of a blue-eyed urchin, running from gutter to gutter, either ignorant of his danger or stupefied by its approach. The Queen, for it was soon after the death of Louis XV., believed for one moment the child was killed, and in her satisfaction at its escape, took it into the carriage, and was about to carry it off, when an old woman rushed out of a neighbouring house, full of apologies, protestations, and alarm. Her Majesty vowed that Providence had given her this boy because she had none of her own. 66 'Where is his mother?\" she asked. ROSINE. \"Alas! Madame, she died last winter!\" was the answer. \"What did she die of?\" \"Hunger, your Majesty.\" The Queen burst into tears, and the people cheered. \"Then I charge myself with his bringing-up,\" said Marie Antoinette, and took her prize off to Versailles-the sturdy little rustic protesting vehemently against his abduction with rebellious kicks and cries. He soon became reconciled to his lot, and the Queen grew very fond of her little \"Jacques,\" as she called him. He was educated and reared in her household, nor did he leave the palace till she had children of her own old enough to fill his place, when he was dismissed with such a gratuity as should afford him a comfortable provision for life. That he spent it all in a few months, plunging into the vices and dissipations of Paris, seemed nobody's fault but his own. A profligate, even when ruined, is not always discontented, but invariably ungrateful. Jacques Armand was both. Gifted by nature with a striking person, and that fiery facility of language which passes for eloquence, even in France, where it is so common, he took a lead in the secret societies and revolutionary clubs at that time smouldering in hidden fire beneath the surface of society, and coined his mouthings into francs, after the fashion of such paid demagogues who mislead the honest folks that feed them, by miscalling themselves patriots. Sounding syllables, audacious threats, inflated metaphors, serve for weapons, and are flourished boldly enough; while to their dupes are left the pike, the gun, and the barricade. Men who talk big of dying for their country, and are lavish of other lives, will generally be found sufficiently careful of their own. It was to conclude an oration, invoking murder, anarchy, rebellion, license, and confusion, under the sacred name of \n\nLiberty, that Armand exclaimed:-\"The time has come to\nCOUPE-TÊTE. 31 read the Powers of Europe a lesson, and fling them down in defiance the head of a king!"}]}

Glancing towards Léonie, notwithstanding his own preoccupation, he was struck by her discomposure. She, too, smiled, and at Rosine, but beneath her smile lurked the cruel expectant glare of the Wolverine waiting for its victim. He was ready of perception, versed in matters of intrigue, and not deficient in self-esteem. His busy brain jumped to conclusions at a moment. \"Can it be,\" he thought, \"that this woman cares for me already? She did not hate Rosine five minutes ago as she hates her now. Yes, she kisses her on both cheeks as they take leave, and I see in her eyes that she would like to tear the girl with her teeth. How handsome she is too, and graceful! How like the Queen as she steps across the room. Hold! I have an idea: if it is as I think, and I can only play my hand with skill and boldness, I shall win on every card in the game!\" When her visitors were gone, and he emerged from his hiding-place, the Count spared none of the arts in which he was so proficient to make a favourable impression on his hostess. He laughed, he trifled, he flattered, he would not enter on serious conversation, but went away, as she thought, far too soon, with a laughing request, in which there was yet less of jest than earnest, that she would soon afford him an excuse to come and see her again.

But now cheers were heard in an adjoining street, swelling to a roar of welcome as they were taken up, louder and louder, by nearer voices; presently a lane opened in the crowd, and a triumphal car, neither more nor less than a\n\nVincent Brooks Day &\nMOTHER CAREY'S CHICKENS. 129 hackney coach with its roof torn off, drawn by brutes on two legs instead of four, made its appearance. On it stood \n\nLéonie dressed in white, with a garland of red flowers round her head, bending occasionally to whisper in the ear of some one, as yet invisible, who seemed to be seated at her side. \"See!\" cried the big fishwoman, quivering with exultation, \"there she is at last. The Wolverine herself. Look at her, little one. Long live the Wolverine! the queen of\n\nLiberty-the only queen we mean to have.” \n\nThe car was brought to a halt within twenty paces of where they stood, and Léonie descended amidst the acclamations of the mob. They crowded round her, they dashed down flowers at her feet, they pressed forward to shake her hands, some of the most enthusiastic, and these were generally men, kissed the folds of her dress. \"That is the sort we want,\" affirmed Rosine's neighbour, nearly spent with shouting, \"a girl of heart, and headpiece, and courage; not a trembling little mouse like you! She will breed men, that one. Bah! what are men? If she will only consent to lead us now, this afternoon-me, and five hundred of my sisters-I tell you we will tear the Austrian out of Versailles with our nails, and bring her into Paris dead or alive.\" Rosine shuddered and looked on. Another shout of welcome, somewhat dashed with derision, even scorn, a smothered oath from her lover, who seldom swore, and a figure rose in the car to address the rabble, while Pierre exclaimed angrily- \"Impossible! Down with the aristocrat! No honest can take part with those who suffer themselves to be led by Count Arnold of Montarbas.”\nCHAPTER XV. \"SILENCE, fool!\" roared the virago, looking with some approval, nevertheless, on Pierre's sunburnt face, and stalwart proportions. \"There are no counts with us. That is Citizen Montarbas, a decent fellow enough, my friend, and one who sticks at nothing. Listen! he has got to speak-this one; he will tell you something you never heard before.\" In effect, Montarbas, rising in the car and waving his hand to entreat the silence which it is only fair to say was readily accorded, proceeded to address his audience with the cool and graceful effrontery that never deserted him. It was the man's nature to stand equally unmoved in presence of the adversary he hated, the woman he loved, the sovereign he betrayed, or the dregs of the populace that he deceived and despised. He had got as far as \"Friends, Frenchmen, republicans, brother-patriots! And you, my sisters, the pride and ornament of Paris, goddesses of liberty and love! \"-a commencement exceedingly well received, when he disappeared below the surface suddenly, in an instant, with the ludicrous rapidity of a jack-in-the-box; while a volley of musketry, reverberating through the lanes and alleys of this crowded quarter, denoted that the contest had begun in earnest, and that real fighting was going on in the adjoining streets. Poor Rosine, thoroughly frightened at last, shook like a leaf; but Mère Boufflon's eyes kindled, and the colour deepened in her rubicund cheeks. \"Do you hear it?\" she vociferated; \"that is something like music! That makes the ears tingle, and smells of gunpowder a mile off!"}]}

The two women, with true female sympathy for the rescuer and rescued, readily adopted Pierre's suggestion that they should hide \n\nCoupe-tête for the night, and start him at daybreak on his return to Paris. Pierre was easily persuaded to remain, as usual, and share their frugal supper. Sitting round the fire, when the platters were emptied, conversation naturally turned on the events of the day, and the enmity of the Count. \"He will score it down on his tablets in letters of blood,” said the grandmother, with something of that assumption in her tone which seems the consolation of those who have no claim to superiority but in their misfortunes. \"I know the race of Montarbas, well. They may forget, but be sure they will never forgive. Small chance of your taking in another acre of forest, now, Maître Pierre. The corvée will be exacted from me, too; and the honey-tax, and the dues on the hens. We shall have no soup on the table, and soon no bread to put in our mouths. Well, well; it seems hard on you young people.

There's a clock in the kitchen, a ham in the chimney, and a pair of clean sheets on the bed. Mademoiselle has but to say the word.

Pierre turned pale. \"I understand,\" he muttered; \"though the balle-mariée at fifty yards might make a difference! They could only take one's life. But thenbut then-what would become of Rosine ?\" His strong frame shivered, and resting them on the table, he leaned his face down on his crossed arms. The girl came round, and laid her hand on his shoulder. \"Pierre,\" she whispered, \"I did half promise, and now I wish I had said no. Why must I be a continual sorrow to those that that love me?

VERSAILLES. THERE is a keen frost and a foot of snow on the ground, at Versailles, as in the forest of Rambouillet. The price of bread has risen; firewood grows scarcer every day; squalid women, pale and haggard, gesticulate in the streets; while rough-looking, able-bodied fellows, hungry, discontented, and unemployed, congregate about the wineshops, trying to forget their privations in brutal ribaldry, and coarse, ferocious jests. Out of doors, cold, famine, and despair; within the line of sentries, and throughout the courts, galleries, and saloons of the palace, pomp, luxury and etiquette reign supreme. The nobleman has his yearly rental on his back; his carriages, horses, and hotel in Paris, would cost more than the fee-simple of his estate, were they paid for, which they are not; and he must carry a pocketful of gold besides, to risk at the royal tables, in accordance with the evil custom of the time. All this expenditure can only be met by holding a sinecure from the king, affording a nominal salary of large amount, wrung from the overtaxed nation, and hopelessly in arrear. He cannot pay his tradesmen, they cannot pay their workpeople, these are in debt to the baker, who owes for the very meal he adulterates, and so the plague spreads, till general bankruptcy becomes general disruption. Already glib speakers, in clubs and committee-rooms, are suggesting the abolition of army, priesthood, royalty itself,\non the practical score of expense; soon hurried beyond their own control, and coerced by the pressure from below, they will advocate desperate measures, and men will go down into the streets with pikes in their hands. In the meantime \n\nLouis is fitting a lock on one of his own cabinets, and, it must be admitted, fitting it admirably. The Queen holds her daily levée, and nobody can spare a moment for any subject but one-viz., who have, and who have not, the right to present themselves without an invitation. Habit is indeed second nature. Frivolity will dance in a churchyard, and fashion, grimacing at Court, trips lightly over a volcano on the eve of eruption, with an ill-timed jest and a vapid smile. Count Montarbas hurries through the crowd that throngs the Queen's ante-chamber, thoughtful and pre-occupied, returning shorter answers than usual to the greetings of his acquaintance. True to his character, now that he is at \n\nVersailles, he wishes himself back at Rambouillet, though he quitted that retreat in the forest under strong feelings of irritation and disgust. His vanity has been wounded, his pride outraged, his feudal authority set at nought; worse still, he has made himself ridiculous-has been baffled by an insignificant girl of nineteen, brought up in the provinces ; a mere wood-cutter-a tenant of his own! It is incredibleimpossible! What would they say could they know the truth, these gilded lords and courtiers, these dainty profligates, among whom he has hitherto been considered a leader in wit, debauchery and intrigue? Why they would lash him to death with jests, epigrams, sarcasms. He would have to abdicate his sovereignty, and could show his face no more in good society."}, {"chunk": 102, "character": "Coupe-tête", "dialogue": "Walk on with us for a quarter of a league.

There were tradesmen from their counters, and thieves from their haunts, sharpers out at elbows, servants out of place, labourers out of work; here and there might be seen young men in decent attire, with a bearing that denoted education and refinement, having no excuse for their presence but a restless craving for excitement, engendered by lives of profligacy and selfindulgence. Though they moved in column, with some imitation of military regularity, there could, of course, be no attempt at real discipline, none of that prompt obedience to orders, for which the first essential is silence in the ranks. They swore, they chattered, they sang, they bandied fierce jokes, hideous threats, and much personal invective, of which the coarseness was spiced with keen and caustic wit. They broached startling theories, to argue them with no little ingenuity, and discussed the science of government in a spirit that was calculated to set every man's hand incontinently at his neighbour's throat. But of all ingredients to be found in such an assemblage, the most unexpected was surely a priest-a priest of holy church, attired in the sober habit of his order, and pacing gravely on, in the centre of these insurrectionists, with as calm a bearing, as stately a step, as if he were under the roof of a cathedral about to celebrate high mass before the altar. Coupe-tête recognised him at a glance, and pressed to his side, it is but justice to admit, with the view of shielding him from insult, and indeed outrage, as far as lay in his power. But there is a spell in the quiet confidence of true courage that acts on such assemblages of degraded humanity, no less\nROSINE. mysteriously than on the beasts of the field. Father \n\nIgnatius moved amongst the ruffians, by whom he was surrounded, like a captain leading his grenadiers rather than a prisoner guarded by his escort. He saluted Coupe-tête with a courteous inclination of the head, and was the first to allude to their parting some months ago in the forest of \n\nRambouillet. \"We have met again, Monsieur,\" said he, \"and, as I anticipated, opposed to each other in the great battle. You have the advantage at present. So much the more reason for gathering every man available to the losing side.\" Coupe-tête looked cautiously round, and whispered in the priest's ear- \"Walk on with us for a quarter of a league. Take the first bypath to the right, and hurry home. I have still influence enough to screen your flight. If you are wise, escape from Paris without delay. My friends here are making stock for the soup, and I tell you they mean putting holy church into the pot first of all! ” \n\nThe other smiled. \"And is that your notion of duty ? \" said he. \"Verily, if the soldiers of the revolution are not more true to their colours than you would have me believe, we on our side need fear little for the result.\" \"Folly!\" replied Coupe-tête; \"I advise you for your good. What are you going to do?\" \"I am going to attend on my respectable friends here through the whole expedition,\" was the calm reply. \"Look at them, Monsieur, they are of your own enlisting; the filth of Paris, the very rubbish and refuse of the streets! But there is nothing to be ashamed of. None of these are more naked under their rags than the courtier in his silks, or the garde-du-corps in his uniform.

It is quite simple-life or death!\" \"It is quite simple!\" repeated the other. \"I choose death! Well met, Count Arnold,\" he continued, addressing\n\nMontarbas, who now hurried up to consult with Coupe-tête. “I know not that we need be surprised to see each other here in a mob of rioters at the very gates of Versailles. Without doubt, we have the same motive. I call on you to help me with your influence and authority in persuading these misguided men to return home without bloodshed, entrusting to the National Assembly and the Constitution. the security of that liberty which is sure to be destroyed by force.\" He raised his voice so as to address the bystanders, who accepted such unpalatable counsels with immediate outcries. for his blood. \"Silence, fool!\" exclaimed Montarbas, provoked from his usual equanimity by the man's self-sacrificing audacity; for he, too, wished to save him if he could. \"Coupe-tête,\" he continued, turning round, \"why have you brought this priest here? Send him back with a guard into Paris!\" But Coupe-tête, for whom the favour of the mob was the very bread he ate, had disappeared; and already scowling brows and loud imprecations warned Montarbas that his own forbearance to a cassock was viewed with suspicion, as a symptom of insincerity, a leaning towards that reaction, the\nROSINE. fear of which drove the revolution deeper and deeper into an abyss of fire, from which anarchy and confusion were to reappear forged and moulded anew in the form of an iron despotism, all-powerful for evil, utterly hopeless and helpless for good. \"Down with the priest!\" they vociferated. \"Down with the cassock! Down with Montarbas, if he will take his part! They are aristocrats; they are in league to betray the nation. Treachery! treachery! Down with them both!\" It was a critical moment, and would have shaken the nerves of most men; yet Montarbas retained his coolness, his presence of mind, and that decision of character, that promptitude of action, right or wrong, which entitles men to command. . \"I can save you now, Monsieur,\" he whispered, \"if you will hold your tongue!\" \"Speak out, Count!\" answered the other, smiling scornfully; \"I will do my duty, whether or not you flinch from yours!\" 66 Montarbas shrugged his shoulders. \"The man is an enthusiast, a fanatic,\" said he, beckoning to Santerre, who came striding through the crowd. \"I cannot stay here to argue till sunrise. Take him to the rear and have him guarded-gagged if you like, and with his hands tied, but do not shed his blood. We might want him in an hour or two, if the aristocrats yonder are disposed to come to terms.\" Santerre shook his head. \"Who is Citizen Montarbas,\" growled this leader of ruffians, \"that I should take his orders? A noble! an aristocrat! What! a peer of France. He is not a man of the people. He is not one of us! Wait a bit, my little Count! Santerre has his eye on you. Perhaps it will take you all your time to look out for yourself!\" And here is the difficulty with which such leaders have to\ncontend. There is a downward impetus in its progress, that those who set a revolution in motion are powerless to arrest. So long as the agitator can make fresh promises, originate fresh changes, and incite to fresh outrage, so long is he adored by an unreasoning and enthusiastic crowd, who ask no better than to cheer themselves hoarse round their idol, swearing they will follow him to the death."}]}

CHAPTER XI. FOUL PLAY. NEVERTHELESS a faro-table was prepared all the same. Judging from the interior of Versailles, a man would hardly have believed that the country could be bankrupt, the nobility ruined, and the throne about to fall. High officers of his Majesty's household attended, splendid, gay, and debonair, as in the time of Louis the Great. Ladies minced and smiled, rustling and sparkling in satins and lace and precious stones. The very pages who waited on the company, the very lackeys who called their names, shone in scarlet and gold. A handful of sentries, belonging to the Maison du roi, dotted galleries and staircases within; a scanty picket of the Swiss Guard piled arms outside. This was the whole preparation for defence, these were all the precautions taken for the safety of royalty, and not four leagues off the fiercest population of any city in Europe only waited for a signal to rise in rebellion against their king. \"Is he imbecile, this good man?\" thought Montarbas, scanning with supercilious eye the line of veterans who turned out to salute a prince of the blood. \"Has he not even the instinct of self-preservation, common to the lowest natures, that he leaves himself defenceless at such a moment as this. Here are barely five hundred men within call of a bugle, and Santerre need but lift a finger to sack the palace\nROSINE. with ten thousand. It may come sooner than any of us think.

His rank, of which he told his new friends he was only desirous to divest himself, entitled him to appear in the Queen's circle under any circumstances of disgrace short of actual banishment from Court. Besides on these \"play nights,\" as they were called, well-dressed persons were admitted in the royal apartments by mere introduction of an official, and might stake their money freely on the cards of prince or princess lord or lady, though etiquette forbade a commoner from sitting down at the table itself. There had been found, moreover, considerable difficulty of late in providing players wealthy and reckless enough to hold a faro-bank. Some of the company, notably Count d'Artois and Mr. Fitzgerald, put down stakes so heavy that few private individuals possessed means to cover them. As the Irish gentleman characteristically observed, \"A rich man couldn't afford to lose, nor a poor man to win!\" and on one occasion, much to the king's disgust, professional gamblers were brought expressly from Paris to conduct the proceedings under his own royal roof. Montarbas, then, felt sure of admittance and even welcome if he only came provided with sufficient funds; so, sweeping together the wreck of his own fortunes, he made up his mind to risk all on the chance of winning so large a stake as should effectually further his views of self-aggrandisement in the impending crisis. Without money he could do nothing amongst the revolutionists, though, with gold pieces in his pockets, they would be willing to overlook the gold lace on\nFOUL PLAY. 93 his coat, freely offering the red hand of liberty, fraternity, and equality, to be filled at his expense. He passed the Queen with a low, deferential bow, but Marie Antoinette had not served an apprenticeship to royalty at Schönbrunn to forget her trade at Versailles, and managed not to see him, with an appearance of perfect unconsciousness and good-humour. Only a courtier could have detected the omission; even a courtier might have believed it wholly unintentional. Montarbas knew better, and added one more item to the score that he vowed should some day be paid in full. When he approached the table there was more confusion and a louder clatter of tongues than is considered decorous in a king's palace. Players were gathered in plenty round the green cloth, and several packs of cards lay ready to cut and deal, but the place of enterprise at one end remained vacant, and none of the company seemed rich enough or bold enough to accept, with its profits, the enormous risks of the bank. Even Count d'Artois, usually the most adventurous of gamesters, hesitated and held back, though pressed to accept the alternative by the Queen. \"Madame,\" said he, \"fortune never favours me in your \n\nMajesty's presence. She seems ashamed of her preference under the eye of a greater lady than herself.\" “And well she may be,\" answered the Queen, laughing. \"For weeks you have presumed on her smiles and abused her favours. She is a goddess, Monsieur; but she is also a woman. You have worn out her patience, and she forsakes you at last.\" \"I have trusted her too far, and she has played me false,” he replied, gaily. \"Your Majesty is right; she is a goddess, but she is also a woman.'

What a contrast to her childhood, her youth, her early history; yet did it seem now a perfectly natural consequence that she should be the companion, the friend, the confidant of her beloved Sovereign. It is strange how soon humanity accommodates itself to changes that would have once been accounted simple impossibilities. The incredible in anticipation becomes almost commonplace when we look back, and it is not too much to say that no man was ever yet raised to a pinnacle he esteemed one inch too high for his merits, or placed in so unexpected a position, but that he felt he had realised something of the same kind before.

Léonie, hoping and caring for nothing but that she might live or die at his side, it little mattered which, looked at the peaceful moon, and wondered vaguely how all this was to end; Pierre pipeclayed his belts, whistled softly the while, and ran his finger approvingly over the point and edges of his pike; Rosine prayed in silence to the\n\nVirgin, listening for every sound; and Marie Antoinette slept.

Alas! what do I say? Even at this moment, though I love you dearly, I must bid you farewell. May our blessed Lady and all the saints in heaven protect you! My dear, you have been a true and faithful servant to me.\" The girl could not speak. She was on her knees holding the Queen's dress to her lips, and looking up to the proud, kind face through her tears, with as much of longing, loving worship, as she could have offered the holiest of those very saints whom her mistress invoked on her behalf. There rang a jar of firelocks outside, creating a stir and bustle in the passage. The carriages were at the door, the \n\nKing was ready, and the royal family must no longer delay their journey to Paris, to the Tuileries, to the Temple, to their doom. The Queen wore round her neck a gold chain with a locket containing her children's hair. She took it off and put it in Rosine's hand, while she bent over her and pressed a kiss on the girl's bonny brow. \"Wear it, my dear,\" she whispered, \"for my sake-to remind you of Marie Antoinette!\" Rosine, looking up, observed how the links had chafed that delicate skin, tracing round the pure white throat a thin circle of red. ROSINE. Then she bowed her head in her hands and wept her heart out, for something told the girl that here, on this side of paradise, she would never see her fair and gracious Queen again. THE END.

He was not easily astonished; but, to use his own words, \"you might have knocked him down with a feather!\" when, surrounded by an escort of the French guards, an exempt took him prisoner in due form, showing the order for his arrest signed by the King's hand. His first impulse was to resist, but ten file of musketeers and a sergeant were too heavy odds, even for an Irishman, and he yielded his sword to the official politely enough, begging it might be returned as soon as this inconvenient mistake was cleared up. \"Mistake!\" replied the exempt, sternly. \"Pardon, Monsieur! we do not make mistakes in such matters. You must come with me.\" \"But, I tell ye it's impossible, my good friend!\" urged the prisoner; \"they couldn't want me for anything but debt, and his Majesty wouldn't interfere in such a miserable trifle as a tailor's bill, God bless him! You must leave me at liberty for another hour, at least I have an affair of honour on hand.\" \"If it were an affair of gallantry, Monsieur, I am sorry I could not oblige you,\" returned the exempt, polite, but firm; and disregarding his prisoner's entreaties that the whole force would accompany him to the place of meeting, sur-\nround it to prevent interruption, see the fight out, as he expressed it, in peace and comfort, and conduct him wherever he pleased afterwards, he marched the Irishman off, without further ceremony, delivered him over to Governor de Launay, and took a proper receipt for him at that fatal gate, where have entered never to emerge again. so many\n\nThus it fell out that the Marquis de Vaucourt, pacing his apartment in a fever of anxiety and impatience, cursed his valet, his coffee, the morning, the mud, the weather, all seconds for indifference, and all Irishmen for unpunctuality, with exceeding volubility and disgust. Having waited as long as he dared-for no temptation on earth could have made him late for a duel-De Vaucourt was forced to set out at last, in a state of considerable irritation, comforted only by a vague hope that Fitzgerald might have mistaken his instructions, and would meet him at the Bois. Dismissing his coach, with orders to return home, he walked briskly forward, in the direction of the three firs, as much to make up for lost time as to circulate his blood, chilled by the cold damp air, looking eagerly about him in every direction for the arrival of his friend. He could distinguish nothing at ten paces' distance, because of a thick mist that crept and curled about the stems of the trees, condensing itself on their branches into a heavy drip, far more dispiriting and comfortless than a fall of rain. It was one of those miserable mornings on which inanimate objects assume unreal shapes and proportions, like the phantoms that pass vaguely through a dream. \"He must have lost himself in this cursed fog!\" thought\n\nDe Vaucourt, arriving at the three firs, in solitary discomfiture. \"No wonder—a man can hardly see the length of his sword! Hold! I am wrong. Bravo! there he is.\" But instead of Fitzgerald, it was the figure of his adversary looming gigantic in the thick atmosphere, pacing\nROSINE. moodily to and fro, cloaked, armed, and solitary, like himself. As they uncovered, with that courtesy which one gentleman necessarily extends to another when he proposes to put him to death, each thought he observed on his adversary's face an expression of wonder and disappointment.

Some of the National Guard, who had hitherto been only visitors in the banqueting-hall, were now pressed to sit down and join the givers of the entertainment as guests. These proselytes outdid the body-guard itself in professions of loyalty and enthusiasm. They were honest citizens enough, abhorring bloodshed, hardship, long marches, short rations, all the inconveniences of actual warfare, and had never carried a round of ball cartridge in their lives. It is needless to say that their bearing was fiercer, their conversation more warlike than that of the veterans with whom they were so proud to associate. It seemed they only wanted opportunity to prove themselves the bravest troops in Europe, the best drilled, the best disciplined, and the steadiest under fire. Young de Vaucourt found himself receiving lessons in the art of war from a stout and shining captain, whom he recognised, after awhile, as the tradesman who supplied him with coffee, and to whom his intendant had lately informed him he owed rather a heavy account. He was, perhaps, none the less tolerant a listener. The worthy grocer having conceived no small admiration for his noble customer, less because of his high rank and lavish expenditure, than his well-known prowess with the sword, did not fail to oblige him with many personal details concerning his own parades, inspections, guard-mountings, and military duties in the good city of Paris. \"It is not all rose-colour, Marquis,\" said he, draining his beaker, with the air of one who has earned the right to a carouse by a long day's march-\" under such a brigadier as ours. He is none of your cotton nightcaps, though indeed he sells them, and very good ones too, in the Rue des Mousquetaires. But to see him behind the counter, and before his brigade—why,\n\nMonsieur, you could not believe it was the same man. When\nROSINE. he puts on his uniform-our uniform, Marquis (it is a serviceable, soldierlike uniform, is it not?) Crac! he becomes a lion, a hero! It is the same with me! Do you not think,\n\nMonsieur, that a brave man grows doubly brave when he finds himself surrounded by comrades all as like each other as black beans in a bushel? You, too, are a soldier, Marquis (here's your health), and you know how a soldier feels.” \n\nDe Vaucourt smothered a laugh in his wineglass. your men, Captain,\" said he, \"are they supplied with muskets? Are they used to handle their arms?\" \"And \"Every Frenchman is born a soldier,\" was the reply. \"For the rest, Marquis, our firelocks have been lately issued, and-and-to speak the truth, we have practised with empty barrels as yet. What of that? We can learn to load them, and to take aim, and in time, no doubt, to \n\nI should hope, fire them off! The Romans were the finest soldiers in the world, Monsieur, except the French; and Rome, you know, was not built in a day!\" \"The Romans knew how to entrench themselves,\" observed De Vaucourt, carelessly. \"Every third man carried a mattock or a palisade. Do you teach your people to throw up a breastwork with the first materials that come to their hand?\" In spite of their late-assumed loyalty, the Marquis thought it not impossible, he might find himself face to face with these unskilled and zealous volunteers. He would take this opportunity of finding out how much they did and did not know. \"A breastwork! What is that?\" replied the other: \"Monsieur, the breastwork of a National Guardsman is his own courage, and the bold heart that beats beneath his crossbelts. We are soldiers of France, Marquis; you and I. Bah! what means the whistle of a ball or two more or less to a soldier of France?

We have not forgotten it was the body-guard that brought us off at \n\nFontenoy!\" CHAPTER XXIV. THE TRICOLOR. AT Fontenoy! Yes, they identified themselves with the glory and the military history of France. These tradesmen of Paris, awkward and uneasy in stiff, tight uniforms, jostling each other in their formations like a flock of sheep, handling a musket with obvious fear of its recoil; assumed to themselves a share in the past triumphs of heroes who could hold their own with Marlborough's grenadiers, and check the picked cavalry of Prince Eugéne; who advanced into action with a hand of fiddles, curled, gloved, scented, and cravatted as if for a ball, and left their dead in hundreds wherever a battery was to be taken, or an outwork of the enemy carried by storm. Could there be one single sentiment in common between a Black Musketeer of Louis the Great, with his debts, his dandyism, his refined prejudices, his intrigues, his duels, his dainty scorn of death, and a respectable grocer, comfortable, thrifty, industrious, sorting goods, posting a ledger, and coming in regularly to his meals? Only this, that each was a Frenchman, and, as a Frenchman, set his country above everything on earth, except her military glory, which he loved even better than France. With six months' campaigning, and a few volleys fired in earnest, these citizens were hereafter to make the finest soldiers in Europe, but at present they were no match for a mere rabble, for a mob of ruffians commanded by Santerre, the scum and sweepings of the streets. THE TRICOLOR. 209 Red, white, and blue were the colours of the good city of Paris. Her national guards elected to wear them in a cockade, and thus originated the famous Tricolor, the flag that, torn to shreds by shot and shell, has floated triumphant in every part of the world where danger is to be encountered and honour won. As the cross to Crusaders, the crescent to Saracens, as our own unconquered Union Jack to sturdy Britons, is the Tricolor to the warlike sons of France. Where it waves there will they make their rush, loose in formation, firing as they advance, but pressing eagerly to the front. How many hearts have shed their life-blood to further it twenty paces in the charge, to preserve its honour unsullied in the retreat; how many eyes swimming in death, and watching it to the last, have taken its image with them into another world; how many noble spirits, swelling with pride and patriotism, have trooped gloriously into Paris under the remnants of their victorious flag!"}, {"chunk": 107, "character": "De Vaucourt", "dialogue": "It is no longer an affair of outposts, You and I will be well in it directly, Pierre.

Coupe-tête was doubtless a man of resource rather than a man of action; but, to use his own expression, there rose something in him that was stronger than himself. Here at his elbow stood the aristocrat who had ordered a couple of gamekeepers to beat him to death; yonder, the bold and honest peasant who rescued him. In another moment the oppressor would have added a fresh outrage to the list of his crimes, and the friend in need would be a dead man! As the Count's finger pressed the trigger, Coupe-tête pushed the ruffian next him, suddenly, against the marksman's arm. His aim deviated the eighth of an inch, and the debt of gratitude was paid in full. But \"the bullet found its billet\" nevertheless. It\ncrashed through the skull of the foremost Sansculotte, who sprang into the air with a yell, and fell headlong on his face, at the very feet of Pierre Legros. \"Assassin!\" exclaimed Santerre from behind, persuading himself, in his jealousy of Montarbas, that this was part of a deep-laid plot against the Revolution and the liberties of the nation. \"It is no longer an affair of outposts,\" observed de Vaucourt, coolly. \"You and I will be well in it directly, Pierre. That means we shall be engaged along the whole line!\" This random shot was indeed the spark that kindled the conflagration. Those in front, who were observant enough to know it came from the rear, excited, bewildered, and suspecting treachery, rushed forward with the courage of despair. The majority of the rabble became infuriated, as usual, at the sight of blood, so that partly from fear, partly from ferocity, and partly from the pressure of those behind, the two champions of the body-guard soon found themselves waging desperate conflict hand-to-hand. A stalwart butcher came on, with his cleaver whirling round De Vaucourt's head; the practised wrist of the Marquis scarcely seemed to turn, and the butcher went down like an ox in his own shambles, while the smooth and gliding rapier passed out of his chest almost as quickly as it ran in. An urchin from the gutters in the streets crept under a line of levelled weapons, that he might twine round Pierre's ankles, and bury the knife he held between his teeth in the guardsman's stomach; but the kick of a heavy boot sent him flying back amongst his comrades, with a shattered blade and a fractured skull; while the Marquis, disposing of another enemy by his lightning thrust, observed two more rioters go down, right and left, to the push of his companion's pike, driven home by that stout and irresistible arm. ROSINE. \"We want a girl with a broom,\" said he, \"to sweep away all this litter we are making on the stairs!\" But Pierre thought of Rosine, and answered only by setting teeth and muscles to run another Sansculotte through the body with all his might. The steps were encumbered with corpses, the boards slippery with blood; but fighting in so far resembles feasting, that the appetite for it increases with indulgence, and such hideous orgies become faster and more furious as the crimson liquor flows. The Sansculottes came raging on like wolves: and, like wolves, seemed to gain confidence from the very volume and confusion of their attack. De Vaucourt's blade flashing in and out of pike, and crowbar, and musket-barrel, answered nobly to the arm that guided it with consummate strength and skill, but the gallant limb was broken by a crashing blow just above the wrist, and with the lowering of his guard, the Marquis received half-a-score of thrusts in his undefended body. \"Make a barricade of me, Pierre,\" he gasped, as he went down; \"but turn my face to all this rabble, because you know I am a peer of France!\" He was quite dead before his lowborn comrade, bestriding him like a colossus, had dealt a dozen strokes to keep the enemy out of distance. Pierre fought with the fury of a wild cat."}]}

But they wounded her to the quick with slanders worse than these.

It was the nature of Montarbas to assume the lead in all enterprises with which he was concerned, and to strike out a path for himself in matters both of action and intrigue. His fertile brain had conceived a plot for further blackening the character of the Queen, thus to avenge the injury she had inflicted on his vanity, while with the same blow he advanced his new cause by weakening her influence as a prop to the throne. Let it only be proved to the people, in their very faces, that she was a bad woman, and even the King's unalterable affection could do little towards lifting her out of the dirt. But to carry his plan through he required the assistance of Léonie, and she gave it him freely, as she had given her heart long ago. They were together in the Hotel \n\nMontarbas. She felt no scruple now in visiting him at all hours and under all circumstances. She was even proud of her brother's remonstrances and the censure of her friends. She gloried in shame and sorrow for Count Arnold's sake, and he indulged her plentifully with both.

I must not be so selfish as to hide your beauty from all admirers. You will have more than ever to-night. I have provided you such a dress!\" She shot a quick, anxious look in his face. It was suggestive of her uncertain tenure that so unusual a gallantry inferred some return on her part, the nature of which she already anticipated with anxiety and misgiving.

He had been engaged in such controversies too often not to know exactly when and where to keep silence. Like a skilful angler, he let his fish have plenty of line to exhaust, and run itself out.

He could observe no reliable signs of serene weather. The tail of the storm was yet to come, and that sailors tell us is often the strongest and fiercest of the gale. So he contented himself with muttering below his breath, \"Don't believe me if you had rather not!

Such scenes were being enacted in every quarter of Paris at which it was thought advisable to check the regular troops; and Montarbas, flying from one barricade to another, made his dispositions, with military skill and ingenuity, worthy of a better cause. The Wolverine, too, played her desperate part with the fierceness and energy that won her nickname. Dressed, as usual, in white, wearing a blood-red scarf round her waist, a knot of blood-red ribbons at her bosom, and carrying a blood-red flag in her hand, she passed proudly through the fishmarket. Its denizens turned out in swarms, shouting, cheering, gesticulating, calling on her only to give the word and they would follow where she led. Mother Redcap brought up more than two hundred, their arms bare, their black hair streaming over their shoulders,\nTHE TRICOLOR. 215 their eyes blazing with excitement and brandy, demanding, for herself and her Amazons, the post of honour in front. Ruffians more than half-drunk, some in women's clothes, swelled the force, but these formed no welcome addition to their ranks, for the Ladies of the Market, as they called themselves, scouted the notion of masculine assistance, exulting in the exclusiveness of their own picked column, their female forlorn hope. When a sufficient number had assembled, the Wolverine halted to address her followers. In a moment over that riotous crowd came a deep silence, ominous, oppressive, like the hush that precedes a thunderstorm. Her clear, thrilling tones seemed to cleave it as the lightning cleaves the cloud. \"To the Hotel de Ville!\" she said, and the explosion that followed echoed half way to Versailles. Shout after shout, yell after yell, caught up, repeated, passed, from street to street, till it shook every rafter in the capital, and caused many a martial tradesman, struggling into his uniform, to ask himself the unpleasant question whether it would not be taken off him before nightfall by other hands than his own! The sluice was open now, and the torrent unrestrained. At the Hotel de Ville a detachment of the National Guard went over bodily, tricolour and all, to join the populace. A' rush was made for the armoury, and those who had come without weapons took whatever was at hand; the lance once couched for Duguesclin quivered in the grasp of a scavenger, the sword that kept the head of a Montmorency glittered in the hand of a Sansculotte.

She turned on the Wolverine a frightened glance of recognition, but her eyes were swimming, and her face was whiter than the cambric on her neck. \"Help me, Pierre!\" she murmured. \"I am suffocated! I am dying!\" The simple, child- \"I am tall and\n\nHe braced himself for a supreme effort. like appeal pierced him to the heart. strong,\" he said, bending his body backward, for he could not turn to look; \"clasp thine hands tight round my neck: \n\nI will carry thee out of this on my shoulders. Courage! Rosine. It is our only chance!\" But Rosine had fainted, slipping noiselessly to the ground, and the Wolverine stood in her place. She sprang to his invitation eagerly, nimbly, with the force of one who leaps for life. She clasped him tight under the chin, so that he could not see those strong white hands twined in an iron grip, and he breasted the crowd gallantly with his burden, cleaving it as a ship cleaves the waters, slow, steady, and persistent, because of the precious freight. Once, she turned her head, in remorse, to look for Rosine. She might as well have looked in the ship's wake for one who had fallen overboard and was drowned. So they reached the end of the alley, the corner of the street, the open square beyond, where even Pierre was fain to halt, and be relieved of his voluntary load. She was on her feet in an instant, and confronted him gaily with a smile. \"I thank you,\" she said, \"for your politeness. You have done me a great service, Monsieur, and I wish you goodday!\" \"Holy Virgin!\" he exclaimed. \"Where is Rosine ?\" \"Fifty paces off in the crowd,\" was her reply. \"She had fainted when I saw her last. Can you not fight your way back, and bring her out ?\" He made no answer. His eyes were set in a hard, fixed stare; his jaw dropped, and a cold, grey hue crept over his face, as it had been the face of a corpse. CHAPTER XVI.

It is Rosine!", "summary": "Léonie reacts to the arrival of Rosine, expressing surprise and relief.", "passage": "This angel of yours, Mother, is a fallen one, no doubt.\" \"She is very different from you and me,\" answered Mère \n\nBoufflon; \"that is what makes me think she comes from heaven. Ah! poor thing, how she trembled when the firing began. I was standing close by her side, then we were separated in the panic, though I tried hard to keep her sheltered by my great carcase. She seemed such a weak thing to be tossed about in a crowd like that. I struggled back to her though, by main force, and there I found her, lying on the pavement, white and bruised, like-like a lily, Madame, crushed under a garden-roller. So I carried her here in my arms, for her bachelor had deserted her a great strong coward. And the first word she uttered, when she came to herself, was Pierre.\" \"Pierre!\" echoed Léonie. \"The saints be praised. It is Rosine!\" \"You know her, do you? Yes, it must be so. She looks as if her name was Rosine.\" Léonie made no answer, so many thoughts came crowding on her busy brain. Her first feeling, venting itself from habit in a thanksgiving to those heavenly powers whom she had long since abjured, was one of relief and gratification, to learn that an innocent girl, rival though she were, had not been sacrificed to her own nimble treachery, in seizing the readiest opportunity of escape. But this healthier sentiment\nROSINE. was absorbed in the jealousy of a woman who loves, when she reflected that Rosine, deprived of her natural protector and imprisoned here in Mother Redcap's house, avowedly that she might fall into the power of Montarbas, had better have died a hundred deaths than reappeared at such a time. The instinct everybody tries to stifle, that never sleeps, and never deceives, warned her how slight was the thread by which she held this man, whom, in spite of common sense, experience, and a resolute character, she could not help loving so dearly. It would break, she feared, with the slightest pull, and a smile from a fairer, nay, a newer face, might at any moment demolish the whole fabric she had been at such pains to rear on so fragile a foundation. He must have forgotten Rosine, surely, but for this strange mischance. Now, his old caprice would resume all the power such wandering fancies exert over characters like his. He was quite capable of forsaking the woman whose happiness depended on his favour, and transferring to another those shallow affections, for which she, the Wolverine, proud and ambitious as she was, would sacrifice pride and ambition without a regret. How could she love such a man? Why did she love him better for his inconstancy and his want of heart? They are mighty powers, both Eros and Anteros, the blushing golden-haired Cupid, and his naughty little black brother. There is a love that elevates, and a love that debases; it is hard to say which is the stronger of the two. \"And you expect Montarbas this evening,\" said Léonie, racking her brain to devise some means of keeping him apart from Rosine, but speaking the while in that calm decided voice, to which she owed much of her influence over less selfcontained natures. \"Every minute,\" answered Mother Redcap, walking to\nthe shop door. \"Effectually-there he is, and Coupe-tête on his arm, coming up the street now.\" Woman's wit is seldom found wanting, and there are certain congenial matters, such as dress, hysterics, and a motherly care for children, in which one woman's sympathy never fails another woman at her need. Léonie ran to a mirror in the back shop, that had reflected the weatherbeaten faces and flashing looks of many a visitor out of the fishmarket, and turned from it with a little cry of vexation and disgust. \"Did \"I cannot meet him like this!\" she exclaimed. you ever set eyes on such a figure? Couldn't I run upstairs, Mother, and put my hair to rights? I look as if I had been birds'-nesting. I declare I'm not fit to be seen.\""}, {"chunk": 108, "character": "Léonie", "dialogue": "Treason!

His brain\nVincent Brooks Day & Son Lith \n\nP. 248.\n\nreeled, his knees gave way, the blows he delivered spent themselves in air, a sea of faces swam before his eyes, and amongst them he had a dim perception of Count Arnold charging up the steps with a fresh reinforcement, and the Wolverine peering over his shoulder in her pale and lurid beauty, like a star of ill-omen shining through the stormrack in a gale. Then his senses failed, he fell against the door at his back; it opened suddenly, and his own dear wife, with a few strong hands of the Swiss Guard, dragged him into safety from within. Those moments had indeed been precious, nor were they bought too dear, though peer and peasant paid for them, one by one, in drops of blood to ransom their Queen, at least for the present, from insult, outrage, perhaps immediate death. While the one was stiffening where he lay, and the other fainting from his wounds, the royal family retired into the farthest wing of the palace, and a strong division of the national guard marching into the courtyard, dominated, to a certain extent, the rioters, with whom they might, or might not, take part. It had been a crisis at which, as sometimes happens in history, destiny hung on the single arm of a brave man. But for the strength of that arm, and the stout heart behind it, scenes of horror must have been enacted before the sun was high, of which the bare idea makes the blood run cold. Count Arnold was the last man to lose his opportunity for want of courage to dare, or energy to strike. When he missed his shot he did not pause to reload, but retired through the assailants, to collect a few of the best armed; and, followed by the Wolverine who could not bear to let him out of sight, returned for a final rush that should carry all before it; and, in making him master of the position, place, as he hoped, the government of the nation in his\nROSINE. hands. He was half-way up the steps, when the door opened for an instant to receive Pierre's falling form, and in that instant he caught sight of Rosine. Even at such a time, it may be that her beautiful face added a fresh incitement to his ardour. He sprang eagerly to the front, waving his sword, and shouting \"Forward! citizens, forward! The body-guard are defeated, and there is nothing to stop us now!\" But other eyes, sharpened by jealousy, had not failed to detect and recognise the well-known features. All the blood in Léonie's body turned to gall, while she marked the man she worshipped thus hurrying into the jaws of death to reach her rival. For one moment she hated him most of the two, and in her agony sprang the mine that blew her to destruction. \"Treason!\" she shrieked. \"Treason to the revolution! to the nation! Montarbas leads you into an ambush. Do not follow him. Listen, the troops are below. Our retreat is cut off! Run for your lives!\" She addressed a willing audience; confused, excited, bewildered by the tramp of soldiers in the court below now occupied by the National Guard; more than suspecting Montarbas from his antecedents, from his clemency to Father \n\nIgnatius and the fatal shot he fired during the attack, they were only too glad to retire in whole skins out of this dangerous staircase already crowded with their dead.

Are they all alike, these aristocrats! There is no safety in trusting one of them. But come along, my lass, and we will see what can be done.\" What could be done? The downward course of events was so headlong that even such advanced revolutionists as Mère Boufflon and Léonie seemed to be losing their influence hour by hour. The latter was utterly unstrung and helpless, tottering as she walked, and only saved from falling by the hold she kept on her companion's powerful arm. Her head hung down, she never lifted her eyes from the ground, and she muttered in short, spasmodic sentences as she crept along- \"It is my fault. I did it, and I loved him. That was why. And now he will hate me. He will never speak to me again-and-he will die-he will die-he will die!\". Once she broke out in a shrieking, choking laugh that made the old fishwoman's stout heart turn cold. Mère Boufflon was no great pedestrian; the night-march from Paris had told severely on her bulky frame, but of the two women she seemed much the less exhausted, when they stopped amongst a group of Sansculottes, resting their muskets on the ground, and forming, with some attempt at military regularity, three sides of a hollow square. In the centre sat Santerre using a drum for a writing-table, and at his side stood two or three of his fiercest followers, affecting to hold a court-martial, of which the sentence was already decided, and the forms, even to themselves, seemed a wild and hideous jest. Opposite the drum stood Montarbas, bare-headed, erect, and smiling, guarded by two blood-stained ruffians, and having his arms secured in a sword-belt, buckled tight over the elbows round his body. The constraint of such a position did not prevent his bending to the Wolverine in a low and ceremonious bow, accompanied by a smile of supreme contempt. \"Citizen Montarbas,\" began Santerre. \"Pardon, Monsieur,\" interrupted the prisoner. \"Your want of breeding excuses your want of knowledge. You are a Citizen, like your ragged friends here. I am Count\n\nArnold of Montarbas, at your service, and a peer of France.\" The ruffian positively foamed with rage. \"You boast you are an aristocrat! he burst out. \"You confess your treason. You admit you have no defence. It is enough; what prevents my shooting you down with this pistol, where you stand ?\" \"The presence of my ragged friends here,\" answered the other, looking calmly around. \"Their fidelity, their sense of justice, perhaps also the rusty muskets they handle with such an amusing awkwardness. When one begins shooting down the chiefs of a revolution without trial, there is no saying whose turn may come next.\" The brewer felt the force of this argument. \"You shall not say you have had no trial,\" he retorted, \"and in effect, there is the evidence to condemn you. Stand forth, Léonie \n\nArmand, and repeat at leisure the charge of treason you made against this aristocrat.\" She sprang forward and stretched out her arms to the prisoner, gasping, choking, like one in a fit, but the words would not out, though she put both hands to her throat, rolling her head from side to side in a paroxysm of despair. \"It is needless,\" returned Montarbas. \"There is no occasion for all this pleading. Can you not see, citizen \n\nSanterre, that you distress the lady? Let us make an end. ROSINE. I am tired of your revolution-it wearies, it annoys me. If I were Lafayette up there, I would load with grape, sweep away all that rubbish, and have done with it!\". Santerre seemed struck dumb by his audacity, the very men who guarded him turned round to stare, and Mother Redcap simply refused to believe her ears. Only Léonie found her voice now at this supreme moment; and, falling on her knees before the brewer, seized his hand to press it against her bosom. \"I did not mean it!\" she sobbed. \"I was jealous, Citizen -mad!"}]}

Notwithstanding the expostulations of his officers, Louis had forbidden resistance till it was too late. The mob were suffered to stream into the very court of the palace, without sustaining a single shot. Soon they arrived at the foot of that private staircase which led to the Royal Apartments, and here, with, or without authority, stood two of the bodyguard, resolved that not a Sansculotte of them all should pass, but over their corpses, into the presence of their Queen. They represented in their different types the pith and flower of the nation. De Vaucourt, handsome, lithe and agile as a panther, the best swordsman in Europe, with the blood of twenty knightly ancestors coursing through his veins; and Pierre Legros, tall and strong as an oak-tree, fierce and faithful as an English mastiff, wielding his pike in a grasp that owed its vigour and tenacity to a long line of rustic forefathers, taught to wrest their triumphs from the lap of nature by endurance of body and sheer force of arm. They stood together at the top of the stairs, and exchanged a glance of mutual understanding, each recognising in the other that true courage which is not without a leavening of good-humour, and has almost a comic element of its own. Said the peasant to the Marquis: \"\"Tis the very job for you and me, Monseigneur. And yet your people were fighting Saracens when mine were killing pigs!\" Answered the noble of thirty-two quarterings: \"You would have made a better account of the Saracens than I should of the pigs.\" Pierre laughed a short grim laugh. \"This rabble are worse than either,\" said he; \"let us give them the treatment of both!\" The head of their column came up the steps, four abreast, the staircase admitting of no wider front. It halted, therefore, and wavered before it reached within push of pike, for each of the champions standing there to oppose it was more than a match for any two ruffians who led the assault. \"Go on!\" exclaimed those in rear. \"See then, Citizens, there are but a pair of these aristocrats to exterminate. Down with the body-guard! Spit them like larks! Crush them like rats! Forward, Citizens, and trample them under your feet!\" But those in front did not seem to see it. Their adversaries were bidden to surrender, were threatened with massacre, were hooted, reviled, insulted, and still none of the Sansculottes found courage to try conclusions with Pierre or the \n\nMarquis hand to hand. These looked at each other, smiled, and descended a step or two simultaneously, as if moved by the same impulse. The rioters gave back, creating an infinity of confusion, and something like a panic in the rear. The want of a leader was too apparent, and Montarbas came hurrying through the column, accompanied by Couptête, whom he had appointed his aide-de-camp; not entirely to the satisfaction of the latter, for, when blows were going, this orator preferred the part of a looker-on. \"Incredible!\" exclaimed the Count, in his clear, mocking\nROSINE. voice, while he pressed forward through the crowd. \"Who will dare to tell me that two hundred Frenchmen can be held at bay by two-and one of these probably a Swiss !\" His old antagonist recognised the voice. De Vaucourt had not forgotten the shameful treachery that defeated him, nor the cruelty that left him on the wet ground to die, and burned to clear off all scores, sword in hand. \"Well met, Count Arnold de Montarbas!\" said he, removing his hat with a bow. \"You have been long expected, and everything is prepared for your reception.\" The irony was lost on those who heard, but the words themselves were not forgotten, and helped hereafter to work out a revenge that even their speaker would hardly have desired. In the meantime, though pikes were levelled, axes brandished, and daggers drawn, a clear space of three or four yards still separated the unequally-matched combatants. \"This is ridiculous! A farce!

The crowd laughed and pped their hands. \"Long live \n\nMère Boufflon!\" they ced \"And long live Marie Antoinette!\" But oh! the contempt on that pale high-bred face! The warning to dismiss her children had not been lost on the Queen's maternal ear, and while advancing to look down upon her people, she believed she came out to face her death. Standing against the ironwork of the balcony, she scanned that sea of up-turned faces no less undauntedly than her princely ancestors were used to scan the foes for whom they set lance in rest; but with feelings how different to those of the mailed champion, panting only to win honour from an adversary honourable as himself! No. She stood there alone; to accept ingratitude where she had conferred benefits, to sustain outrage where she had a right to homage; and the only armour she wore was her own courage, the only allies she could count on were her own self-sacrifice and sense of right. How proud she looked, how beautiful, and oh, how sad! With head erect, shoulders thrown back, and drawn to her fullest stature, it seemed as if here, at the last extremity, she would bate not one inch of her native majesty, would narrow not by one hair's breadth the royal mark she offered, for a rebel's insult or an assassin's shot! And this was the face that thousands had thronged to welcome over their frontier, when the name of Marie Antoinette meant all that was brightest, and fairest, and happiest in France; when an unkind look would have been treason, a harsh word sacrilege against the Queen-this face so faded with sorrow, so seamed with care, so worn and carved\nand hollowed by the chafing spirit within, that accepted stubbornly a fate it was powerless to dominate, too brave to flinch, too noble to complain. ueenly, even now-in its er hopelessness, that by no\n\nYet was it pure, and fair, and patience, its resignation, in tlu means affected its expression of stern endurance, and in its quiet, dogged, Austrian courage-calm, scornful, almost stolid under the deadening pressure of despair. As her people looked up at her standing there, majestic and unmoved, to bear the brunt of the storm without quailing whatever it might bring; so firm, so undaunted, yet so helpless and forlorn; the reddest of republicans felt his heart moved by the touching contrast; more than one brawny hand shifted its weapon to wipe away a tear, and the very furies of the fishmarket began to sob outright. \"Trust thyself to us, Madame!\" shouted Mother Redcap, in her stentorian voice. \"Thou wilt be nowhere so safe as at \n\nParis in the midst of us. And bring the children too. We love children, I and my sisters. What! We are wives, some of us, and mothers nearly every one!\" The peopled laughed, and applauded. The Queen bowed; the cheering was redoubled, and Marie Antoinette retired from the balcony, in such a burst of admiration as might have done honour to the most popular Sovereign who ever graced a throne. Mother Redcap, much pleased with herself, and loving the sound of her own voice, would have taken this opportunity to make a little speech, but that she felt a hand on her elbow, and turning round, was startled to confront Léonie, looking more like a corpse out of its grave than a Frenchwoman clothed in living flesh and blood. The Wolverine, always pale, was now perfectly white, her lips bloodless, her eyes dull, her whole appearance denoting the extreme of mental anguish and mortal fear.
