There was a blur, too, before his eyes, and he hardly knew what was going on around him. That is, he was soon aware that two pairs of strong arms went around him, one after the other, and that he was enthusiastically welcomed by a couple of bronzed and bearded men in rusty uniforms which might never have been as brilliant as was his own. Then he was led into a tent, and only those two men were with him. It was a grand time for \n\nLee, and all the reporting he had performed for General Washington or anybody else was as nothing compared to the account which he had to give of himself and his doings during the many long months since the Bowie brothers had looked each other in the face. It was a long, long talk, and it was a late hour in the night when the major and the captain, for such they were, went away to their rest and their soldier duties so that their newly found, or rather rediscovered, brother could lie down upon his French blanket and go to sleep. He did so with a curious idea floating around in his mind that it would be almost beyond belief, next morning, to wake up with-\nout any help from the British drum-taps and not have to go out and feed and curry the horses of the king's cavalry. As for them, they had been his companions so long that even while his eyes were closing he drowsily raised his head and listened to hear if there were possibly any disturbance among them. He slept soundly and long, but it was no drum-beat that awakened him. It was the roar of a heavy gun, for Washington now knew what was to be the next movement of Lord Cornwallis, and he had ordered a forward movement which was intended to encourage his lordship in retiring within his inner line of entrenchments. CHAPTER XVIII  \n\nIr was a dark night, and it appeared to be especially gloomy over the wide, unoccupied space between the British lines and the camps of the American army before Yorktown. Among these there were camp-fires burning, and there were lanterns moving here and there. One of these lanterns passed by the huts and tents of the Maryland line at about half-past seven o'clock, and it found Lee Bowie standing in front of a tent, leaning upon his beautiful new musket. He was not there on duty, however, and it was not the mere light of the lantern which gave him such a start. \"General Washington himself!\" he exclaimed. “He is going somewhere. I wish I knew where he is going.\" The general was not alone, for several officers and an escort of riflemen were with him, and none of these said a word to Lee when he shouldered his musket and fell into the hindmost rank as if he belonged there. All were on foot, and Lee's curiosity grew stronger 213\nand stronger as they marched on in silence away beyond the spot where he had escaped so remarkably from Captain Cary's scouting party. Then he saw the general himself take the lantern and hold it up for a moment, looking at something. \"Hullo!\" said Lee. \"They are digging like mad! They are throwing up a breastwork. It looks like a long one.\" So it did, for as the general turned and walked slowly onward, pausing now and then to speak to the men and their officers, Lee discovered that these new works were to extend along the entire front, about two miles, for the siege of Yorktown had begun in earnest and the French and American soldier laborers were constructing the first (6 parallel\" of the approaches."}

There were some who had families and refused to leave them. There were old and feeble folk and women and children, and all who were sick were compelled to keep to their unprotected beds while they waited to learn what the hands of the enemy would do for the helpless capital of the old Virginia Dominion. Governor Jefferson himself was now on horseback, dashing hither and thither at a rate which before night about killed the good animal which carried him. He succeeded in doing to the last inch whatever there was to be done, and there had been one point in his favor. For some inscrutable reason, General Arnold had made a blunder the previous day. Instead of pushing on up the river and saving every possible mile of distance before going ashore, he had landed, as Tom Evans reported, at \n\nWestover, twenty-five miles below his destination. This was on the 3d of January, and he had been able to advance only a dozen miles or so before night. He went into camp with his whole force, and, although he set out bright and early on the morning of the 4th, anything like 2\na surprise was now out of the question. The vigorous \n\nVirginia governor, standing there in the road, had but been waiting for precisely the news which Tom Evans brought him, and such things as State papers and records were already far away at Charlottesville or elsewhere. Toward night the governor took a fresh horse in place of the one he had used up, and galloped off to join his family at Tuckahoe, and to send it yet farther into the interior. The last man to whom he spoke, when he mounted his horse to go, was only a boy, after all. \"Lee Bowie,\" said the author of the Declaration,\" you are a brave fellow. I mean to be over there at Manchester, on the other side of the James, at about ten o'clock to-morrow. Get across as soon as you have learned all you can, but you may not be able to do that the first day. Wait!\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Lee. \"I'll wait and watch till \n\nI've something that's worth while, but if you don't see me again pretty soon, you may just know they've made an end of me- 99 \"Or made a prisoner of you,\" interrupted the governor, \"and that's almost as bad, sometimes. Watch and lie still! Good-by!\" He struck in his spurs at that moment and his horse sprang swiftly away. \"Spy? Spy?\" exclaimed Lee Bowie, looking after\nNO ARMY \n\n11 him. \"No, I ain't even so much as a scout. I'm only a fellow that stayed behind in Richmond because he wanted to see the British march in. I'd like to watch 'em, though, along a rifle-barrel, resting across a fence for a good aim.\" CHAPTER II  \n\n(6 THE poor fellows are worn out! I was afraid of this. Oh, how sorry I am! I wish I could do something for them. They have endured heroically.\" A tall, noble-looking man, in the buff-and-blue uniform of the Continental army, stood near a window with an open letter in his hand. He raised the letter and appeared to be reading it over slowly from end to end. Then he turned and gazed thoughtfully out of the window. It was a cold and dreary midwinter landscape. There was more snow to be seen than in the neighborhood of Richmond, but the scenery was as desolate and the trees were as leafless."}

It was somewhat in the nature of a flag of truce, and it proposed a kind of plunderer's bargain. Arnold offered to spare the town all injury if his vessels of all sorts might be permitted to come up the river unhindered, to take on board cargoes of the abundant tobacco which the marauders had found in the warehouses in and about Richmond. The offer was, of course, to be indignantly rejected. While no confidence whatever could be given to any such promise, the proposal itself informed the governor of Arnold's military weakness, and that he did not intend to attempt a permanent occupation. At the same time, he had no means of inflicting harm upon a few small craft which had already reached the Richmond wharves. The flag of truce, with its buccaneering bargain, was still on its way when Lee Bowie quietly sauntered away from Mrs. Betty Randolph's gate with a mental deter-\nmination to be guided by the old woman's caustic admonitions. While the greater part of the population had prudently decided to keep indoors, a considerable number, mostly boys of various sizes, were out for a look at the British. Neither officers nor soldiers were paying them any attention, for they were not plunder, nor was there any apparent military danger in them. It would not, however, have required a very sharp pair of eyes to have detected a difference between the manner and bearing of Lee Bowie and the others, as he went around from place to place and took swift notes of every horse and gun and soldier. There was an alertness, a keen flash of the eye, a compression of the lips, and an air of being on important business which was not at all in accord with Mrs. Randolph's instructions. Nobody had as yet spoken to him, but every inch of him betrayed the fact that he was a young patriot wishing that he had a gun with which to shoot this entire invasion of Virginia by Great Britain. 3\nCHAPTER III  \n\n\"THERE! The villains are setting the buildings on fire. They are breaking into the houses. They are plundering everywhere. It's time for me to go back to Mrs. \n\nRandolph's. I can't do any more just now.\" It was only too true. Arnold's embassy had gone and had returned, and the reply he had received had stirred up all the vindictive spirit within him. It had also appeared to tell him that the governor must have more forces at hand or shortly to arrive. It might be, therefore, that his expedition was in danger of speedy interruption, and that it would be well for him to do his remaining work quickly. It was about the middle of the afternoon and Lee Bowie had almost reached his place of intended refuge, when he suddenly felt a strong hand on his shoulder and heard a loud, angry voice commanding: \"Bring the young wolf to me. I'll see what there is in him.\" 26\nIn a moment more he was standing in front of a man of not more than medium stature, broad shouldered, strongly built, with an aquiline nose and fiercely piercing eyes. His face seemed to express a superabundance of fiery energy, pride, courage. He was just the man to have done all the daring deeds, with perhaps one sad exception of insanity, which had made up the brilliant but erratic record of General Benedict Arnold. \"Now, you young rascal, who are you? This youngster here says you are not a Richmond boy. You came from the South. Out with it!\" Hard held by a soldier who stood near the general was a little chap of not more than ten who at this moment broke in with: \"No, thir. He ith one of our men. He came with 'patches to the gov'nor. I'd like to thee him thoot you dead!\""}

Hardly had they entered the room, however, and as if it were his first duty, under the circumstances, Arnold delivered to General Philips a not very large packet of papers, remarking: \"This contains the correspondence I mentioned, and some other things of varied importance. Everything about the post is in complete readiness for your own further orders.\" \"General Arnold,\" he responded with a somewhat peculiar dignity of manner, \"please go on giving your own orders for the present. I will take these papers to my room now, for I wish to compare them with others that \n\nI already have. I will see you again at the dinner-table.\" \"Certainly, general,\" exclaimed Arnold. \"I will show you your room.\" Out they went together, unattended by others, and in three minutes more Arnold returned alone, to say to the company, which now made the \"business room\" almost crowded and also noisy with all sorts of conversation: \"Gentlemen, I am compelled to repeat, after our distinguished commander, that I will see you all again at the dinner-table. That will suit you, undoubtedly, and \n\nI have also his additional instructions.\" Without another word, he stepped quickly out of the room, and they were left to their own devices, or rather to the hospitable care of his staff and of a fast-arriving swarm of the officers of the Portsmouth force. General Philips was now alone in the chamber which had been provided for him, and he was hastily examining the packet of correspondence. He was apparently under the pressure of some strong anxiety, the cause of which he did not explain aloud. General Arnold was also alone, in another room, and he was standing with his back against the mantel of its fireplace, but he was not examining anything; that is, not anything in writing or that would have been visible to anybody else. 66 \n\nIt has come!\" he said, in a low, husky tone. \"I am superseded. This is one more fruit of the jealousy that \n\nI have seen from the beginning. It is perfectly clear to me. After all I have done, they do not consider me one of themselves. They can not really distrust me, for my very life is at stake. I am the only officer in the king's forces who can not permit himself to be taken prisoner. An original Tory might be a safe prisoner of war, but I would not. And now, why am I deprived of an independent command and of an opportunity to distinguish myself and prove my loyalty? He left his place at the mantel and began to stride rapidly up and down the room. It was evident that some- \n\n---\nBURNING UP \n\n101 thing or other had stung him deeply, but it ought not to have been the mere arrival of General Philips. No rightminded military man should have felt hurt at finding himself outranked by his superior officer. Neither could the\n\nBritish army authorities be expected to regulate their appointments to duty with reference to any one man's personal ambition. Possibly, therefore, Arnold's present fit of dissatisfaction was affording a kind of pinhole through which might be seen one of the weaknesses which had led him into his awkward position. \"Superseded!\" he again exclaimed. \"Just as I had completed my plans. Oh, what could I not have done with these reenforcements! And now Philips will get the credit of whatever successes are to follow. Well, at all events, I have blistered the Virginians, and that is something. As soon as I can, I must and will have a force at my own disposal. What I mean to do is to strike New England harder than I have the Old Dominion. I want to burn out that nest of rebel privateers at New London. That would be a blow at the rebellion that it would stagger under. Then I'd like to push on up the river and burn New Haven."}
