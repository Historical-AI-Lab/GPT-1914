Not a moment is left the child for a farewell talk with her father, between watching Ch-one and the excitement arising from the discovery of the witch's disappearance. For when the tide had bared the place of her stake to reveal, not the stark body of the miserable witch, but the idle, water-curled thongs washed about the stake, almost a panic seized the villagers, and increased manifold the dark forebodings of Ka-kee regarding his son. \"Ch-one would die,\" he thought; \"the power of the witch had been beyond their reckoning; she had, by the might of her demon, broken her bonds and become invisible; no doubt she had taken wings and had hovered over them, brooding evil while they slept!\" Not one of all the village, save the poor witch Shahehe, connected Kotch-kul-ah's absence with that of the slave woman. The children were off for all day, and until they returned it would not be known that neither Kotchkul-ah nor the canoe was with them. Excitement thus centred in the disappearance of the witch. As the day advances and the wind proves favorable, the men become anxious to get on their way by the afternoon tide; but before it can be thought safe to launch a boat great fires must be made on the beach, and around them the people must dance with incantations, and cast into the devouring flames offerings of various kinds. This done, all is hurry and rush to get on the tide at its flood. The packs of furs and bundles of dried salmon, blankets, and extra clothing of native-dressed leather are stowed in the bottom of the large canoe. Twelve fine specimens of the Chilkat tribe take their places, with paddles in hand, ready for their leader's signal, while the \n\nA Valk. boat is held from the willing waves by the arms of stalwart friends, who, at the signal, will push her off. The leader-and in this case he is also helmsman-is Kah-sha, who stands erect in his place, with a keen eye surveying the preparations and directing a little rearrangement of hastily placed baggage, making it more compact and at the same time trimming the little craft more perfectly. Two square sheets and the poles for their support are also placed where their raising will be the work of a moment when they pass out of the shelter of the bay into the breeze which is sweeping down the channel. These last arrangements are all but completed, when Kah-sha's attention is suddenly arrested by the appearance of Yealh-neddy, knife in hand, running toward the boat from the direction of Sha-hehe's place of torture. The knife is replaced in its sheath at his belt as he runs, and snatching a bundle from his mother, who has stood silently awaiting him, he dashes into the water, tosses his luggage into the canoe, and with a light spring takes a place near Kah-sha himself. The whole thing has occurred in a moment, and not one of the traders but is taken by surprise. \"I have cut the thongs from Sha-hehe,\" he calls out loudly, above the noise of the water and the expressions of astonishment. \"Cover her and heal her, old woman, against the time I come again. I shall want her then.\" Even before the last words are uttered the signal has been given and the boat is off, the rhythmic paddles moving as by perfect mechanism to the measure of their boatsong. Very soon the sails are hoisted and are caught by the fresh north wind, bearing the little bark rapidly from the sight of those on the shore, who sing them farewell and good fortune.

The meeting between herself and her mother is wordless and without demonstration of feeling of any sort. She learns that a canoe has but a few hours ago arrived from Sitka to trade for oil, and that they wish to return by the first tide to-morrow if the wind is fair. Arrangements are soon made by which Kotch-kul-ah is to accompany them. As the evening draws on Kotch-kui-ah sits, lonely and apart, in the great house, almost too numb to fear anything or to realize her distresses, except that just whichever way she turns there is darkness and suffering and a\nhopeless dragging of life. Her baby has fallen asleep in her arms. She has him, but what shall she do with him? That is as dark as all the rest. Sitting thus in the gloom she does not notice the slow, silent approach of a woman—a woman younger than herself-does not notice until the woman has come very near and sits looking with shy and kindly eyes up into her own, so heavy and sad. She has not even noticed the eyes until touched gently by the woman's small, smooth hand. Younger, and she is smaller than Kotch-kul-ah. Her dress is a print of delicate pattern and of the nicest workmanship. Everything about her betokens a gentle and refined spirit. The face is not so handsome as Kotchkul-ah's own, but it is round and smooth and has a healthy color. It has, withal, an expression of truth and strength and simple sincerity, such as wins you as soon as the trusting eyes have looked into yours; and then, when the mouth has smiled, you know that you could not distrust the indwelling soul of that woman, with the world's evidence against it. Kotch-kul-ah sits and gazes at her until she has felt all this, and feels not so sure that somewhere there may not be a little light. Then-- \"You are Tashekah?\" \"Ah!\" with a shy dropping of the eyes. \"Why did you come here?\" Without a word the little brown hands take from under her blanket a small basket of fresh, white herring eggsan early spring delicacy-and a curiously-carved bone dish of the pure, white oulacharr oil, and set them before Kotch-kul-ah. \"You have eaten nothing; you cannot have a strong heart,\" she says. \"What is that to-any one?\" the weary Kotch-kul-ah\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nasks, her heart touched enough to make her lips ungracious. An instant's silence, with a pained, questioning look in the child-like face, then: \"You are cold,\" the gentle voice says. \"Wait: I have tea that my father got at Fort Simpson. I will bring you some; it will do you good,\" and she has gone. Kotch-kul-ah lays her sleeping babe down against the wall beside her, and covering her face on her knees, sits so until aroused again by the same peculiar touch. There is Tashekah low at her side, with a bowl of steaming, fragrant tea. \"Drink it, dear!\" Taking the bowl into her own hands, Kotch-kul-ah drinks it eagerly. Then, handing back the cup, she says: \"It is good; it is like you!\" With a look of gladness Tashekah is about to go, when Kotch-kul-ah catches at her dress. \"Wait! Give me your hand!\" And taking one from a number of silver bracelets on her own arm she fastens it on the slender wrist of Tashekah. \"You will never see me again, but you will think of me many times; and I-I will not forget you. Be happy! Tashekah looks in tender wonder, while Kotch-kul-ah, with a passionate gesture, covers her head and creeps closer to her baby. Then, taking up her bowl, the childwoman goes silently back to her little corner in the house of Ka-kee, where soon she is wrapped in dreams of peace; nor knows when, a few hours later, the storm-tossed Kotch-kul-ah sets sail with the trading people for Sitka.

With even more frantic and horrible gyrations than those he had used over the dying chief, but occupying much less time, his incantation is ended and the swooncollapse has succeeded. Where all has been tempest and uproar the silence of the dead now reigns, but it is a silence tense with expectancy. The spirit of the sorcerer returns. Amid the shiverings of his body the voice comes in those far-away, sepulchral tones which always inspire the people with awe and terror. \"I have found the demon-there!\" And springing to his feet, his long, bony finger is thrust out toward a middle-aged woman near the door. His body bends rigidly toward her; his eyes seem to cauterize her every nerve of motion; a deathly pallor overspreads her face; her eyes are distended in horror; but she neither moves nor speaks. \"Take her!\" he cries. \"That demon will not burnonly drowning can destroy her power.\" It is not now a difficult matter to make way through the crowd. Strong men have seized the woman and drag her out of the doorway. The tide is far out. A heavy stake is soon driven securely into the hard beach, a little more than half-way out, where the returning tide, wave by wave, will rise far above the head of the victim. The unfortunate witch has been found harboring the evil spirit that caused the disaster. And here she is lashed to her stake as Shahehe was to hers. Having made the witch thus secure to her fate, the slow, sure coming of which will prove her torture, the excitement of the outsiders abates to such an extent that, weary as all the feasters are, they gladly seek refuge from the storm within the sheltering homes of the village. As one dead still lies little Ch-one, save that now and then a short sigh escapes his white lips. Grimly his father sits watching the child, while the mother, sobbing, crouches over the precious body. Now she puts back his damp hair and covers his brow with kisses, calling over all the pet names she ever gave him. Tashekah in tender sympathy drops silent tears over the sleeping babe in her lap, and dozes from utter exhaustion. Wise and kindly Kah-sha remains, and a few other friends; while the multitude have gone to their homes or\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nAlready rolled themselves up in their blankets here. the air is resonant with the signs of heavy sleep. The little horn dishes of tallow with their twisted wicks have long ago burned out, but Kah-sha has found material to replenish one, and it burns near the sorrowing group. \"I would make his blood run, Ka-kee,\" Kah-sha says, while fingering gently but intelligently the child's head. \"That was a heavy blow. The head bone pushes in. The blood is thick and will spoil in there-better set it moving.\" \"See, Kah-sha,\" Ka-kee answers in an unusual voice, extending his weak and trembling hand. \"Is that ready to do such work? If the wind falls before morning he will live.\" \"I can do it,\" says Kah-sha, not noticing the last remark. \"See my hand!\" And as he speaks he holds out his firm and well-shaped hand, with a small, sharp knife in its grasp. \"Do it, then, if you like,\" groans the father; and with a skilful turn of the instrument the deed is done. A little gentle friction over the surface, a chafing of the hands and feet, and, drop by drop, the slow blood begins to flow from the newly opened wound. A little more, and a small stream of the bright fluid is discharged. Circulation is further stimulated, and wet cloths are bound about the child's head. His breathing grows more natural, and the color begins to return to the lips. Sleep overpowers the weary watchers, heavy with sorrow. The tallow lamp burns out. The village sleeps."}

IIO \n\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nCHAPTER X. PURPOSES NOT CROSSED. CLEAR 'LEAR and beautiful dawns the morning, but the village of Yhin-da-stachy sleeps long. The tide has well run out again before any one of those who were to have started this morning for Fort Simpson has awakened; and when at last they do arouse, it is with a heaviness of sense that urges no haste. There is a rubbing of eyes, a stretching of limbs, a turning over on the back, a drawing up of the knees, a folding of the arms under the head, and a delicious sense of rest with time for rest. The patient children have long ago finished their sleep, and taking what they wanted of the ever-ready dried salmon, have without ado betaken themselves to the field, wild with joy over the ripening of the first berries. It is long before Kotch-kul-ah's absence is even noticed, and when it does become known there is only a lazy conclusion that she has gone roaming with the children, and no further thought is given her. Ch-one has aroused once or twice, speaking a word or two in an intelligible way, taking water in little, slow sips, then dropping off again into what seems almost too still a thing for sleep. His mother has carried him home in her own arms, leaving Tashekah to follow with the baby. Once more Ch-one has aroused with his new friend's name on his lips and an appeal in his dull eyes. Tashekah leaves the baby asleep, swinging in his leather ham-\nIII mock; and as she bends over the little sufferer and takes his hand in her own a look of pleased satisfaction comes into his face, and the little hand flutters feebly; then the tired eyes half-close again, and he seems to know nothing more-only, when Tashekah, over-weary, withdraws her hand to move about, the little one shows signs of unrest. \"Leave him not, Tashekah!\" the mother, Sa-allie, pleads, thinking of more than the present; \"he loves you, and you give him rest.” \"I love the child-man, too,\" Tashekah answers; \"but my father goes south to-day, you know, and my brother will take me to my grandmother to-morrow.\" \"Then Ch-one must die! See how he rests when you are near him, and the quiet heals his hurt. If you go away, his spirit and his blood will make fire enough to take his life. You do not want him to die?\" \"Oh, no, no! He loves me. He must not die! Surely the great medicine-spirit will help him. I will do what I can; but my father may want me to go and my brother may not like to have me stay.\" \"We will see to that. Your father is wise and good; he will know what is best, and he will not deny us this help,\" is Sa-allie's confident reply. Ka-kee lies curled up on the floor near his little son, still anxious, still depressed. He has heard the conversation between Tashekah and his wife, and resolves to see Kah-sha at once, though his own heart seems to have died. He cares for nothing now; but Ch-one needs the girl; she must stay for his sake."}

It is Kunz; a good deal shaken up, but he soon gets upon his feet and shares the anxiety of the now aroused village in regard to the fate of his companion. It was \n\nChan-ka, nephew of Yealh-neddy, that was with him; and Yealh-neddy at this moment is lying within his wife's house, heavy with drunken sleep, a result of last night's feast, for which he had provided several boxes of hoots-anoo of his own manufacture.

There is no death so held in terror by the Kling-gets as that by drowning-doomed as they believe such a soul is to eternal wandering in cold and pain, ever and vainly seeking rest. The shrieks and the groans of the women are heard high above the thundering of the waters, which are dashing and breaking on the shore. Some of the men have gone to look at the boat. As they turn over its ruined, broken hull they find the sailsticks wedged into it and the sail curiously wrapped and caught between them. Stop! There is something within. Can it be one of the logs? With haste they disentangle it, and-their shout is only unheard by the mourners because of their own shriller noises! But they are silenced when the men have taken up the body and start across to one of the dwellings. It is indeed Chan-ka! And now great is the regret that \n\nKa-kee is not at home. The medicine-man has gone to \n\nChilkoot, and there is nothing for it but to do, without the medicine-spirit, what they can to restore the breath of the drowned boy. Such women as Usha-shawet are speedily at work, and before Kin-da-shon and his party have refreshed themselves with food and made dry their clothing by the hospitable village fires, the boy is breathing and conscious, causing great talk and rejoicing among the people. Kunz has restored himself to his household, of which, in his father's absence, he has felt himself the guardian and provider. Sa-allie has gone herself and brought Kin-da-shon to their own fire, setting before him the hearty breakfast which she had kept warm for Kunz. 1\nWhile he sits eating it she holds his clothing and dries it about the leaping flames.

The eyes, however, are unnaturally large and bright, with a world of woe and appeal in them. For a long time he sits in perfect silence, looking on with expression so wise and grave that at length his mother, with a silent gesture, calls Kin-da-shon's attention. \"He is always just like that,\" she says, in muffled tones. \"Does he walk?\" Kin-da-shon asks. \"No: see!\" And Sa-allie draws out the little shrivelled legs, crooked from long doubling under him. \"He has never stood on them since that dreadful night.

Not many hours have passed before it is asserted and believed that during the night the witch was seen to rise up out of the water and fly over to the dead-houses, from which she presently emerged, hovered over the house of the dead chief's widow, and, by demoniacal power, brought to her arms from the room below the helpless Kotch-kul-ah, whereupon she caused the canoe to rise,\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\npass under, and convey them as on wings over the dark waters, where they eventually disappeared, as a raven, to the opposite distant shore. Nothing is done toward sending out parties in search until next morning. Then the country between the villages is pretty thoroughly scoured, and the villages themselves soon set agog by the new excitement. Kasko thus finds himself in the company of the search party going to Chilkoot. Having crossed the portage, the party divides, one half going by land, the other by water—the former making an examination of every deadhouse on the route. To insure their own safety they carry a stout rope of sinew, which is to be made fast about the waist of the man who ventures in to examine the boxes of bones and ashes, the other end being held with a strong grasp by the remainder of the party, who stand ready to drag him back if any haunting spirit should prove too powerful for him. Those who go by water, with the same precaution visit the caves along the shore where the unburned bodies of medicine-men have been laid from time to time through many generations. As these are places peculiarly attractive to spirits of many kinds, every one who is obliged to approach or pass them resorts to means which, it is hoped, will divert the attention of such demons as are disposed to attack the intruders, and appease their anger also. So as the canoe glides near the sacred and unholy places, eagle's down is blown about through the air on every side by the men, chanting at the same time strange words of invocation. As they proceed bits of tobacco and other delicacies are tossed into the water."}

Having witnessed this transaction also, Kin-da-shon turns and, retracing his way through the village, resumes his journey. KIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nCHAPTER XIV. USHA-SHAWET, KOTCH-KUL-AH, AND KIN-DA-SHON. IN N escaping from Yhin-da-stachy Kotch-kul-ah was guided by the experience and natural sagacity of her companion. For many years Usha had been accustomed to moving about the country as a trusted slave, getting in supplies of berries and such herbs and barks as were constantly in requisition for medicinal purposes, for tanning and for coloring the grasses also and the bark-lining needed for basket-making. Knowing the country so well, and being versed in the art of living under such conditions as attended independent out-door life, she was well able to direct their course to a place of hiding which would be both secure and comfortable, at least for a time. Crossing the wide channel at once, they followed the shore north for some distance, until, striking a small sandbank, which even the high tides did not always cover and which now lay quite exposed, they disembarked. Making a small pack for Kotch-kul-ah, including only her own blanket and the paddles, with a small bundle of dried fish, Usha gathered what remained of their baggage into a large and compact bundle and hid it in the heavy undergrowth on the shore. Then taking up the canoe, overturned on her head and shoulders, herself scarcely visible as she moved along, she led the way over the hard, smooth sand. After a long tramp they came to a softly flowing mountain stream which had no visible outlet-its waters sinking into the gravelly\nshore and disappearing altogether far above the bed of the river. Hiding the canoe in the bushes and finding a comfortable retreat for themselves, they rested and ate their fish. After such refreshment Usha went back for her pack, and with it safely returned to Kotch-kul-ah and led the way up along the course of the stream, till, about half-way to the mountain's top, they came to a lovely little lake, where the spotted trout were leaping in the sunlight like truant beams of stronger growth. Here, on the lake's sweetly wooded shore, these homeless women found rest and peace and strength as full as the natural world can give it. To this spot Usha brought the canoe, and during their summer's tarrying much improved it by sewing up its cracks with twine of bark, lining and stuffing them with fine moss and melted gum. They repaired the booth of hemlock boughs which Usha had made and used long before, and within they made them fresh beds of the same fragrant material. For Kotch-kul-ah it was precisely the sort of life needed for the counteracting of such pestilential poisons as her two-years' confinement had engendered. When, after three months, Usha brought her out again to seek a winter dwelling-place among the sheltering rocks of the eastern shore, it would have been hard to recognize the high class of the girl by her complexion. All the angles of face and figure had disappeared, charming curves of girlish beauty had taken their place. The contracted chest and stooping shoulders were transformed; the step was elastic and free as a deer's; the eyes were full and bright and the complexion dark and ruddy."}

The sky was black-not a star was visible; the air itself seemed peopled with creatures of the dark. 'Twas such a night as causes one involuntarily to drag the foot and put out the hand, to shut the eyes on what we cannot see, that the inner sight may the more keenly perceive what lies about us. A little to one side, and back of the big house, Shahehe's stake had been fixed. By reason of the excitement attendant on the sacrifice of the slaves, and afterward the gathering of the mourners to cry dry the river through which they would have their chief pass dry-shod, the\nyoung witch had been left almost unnoticed, and, for a time, unnoticing. The weird chant, the wild wailing of the women, had entered into her benumbed, unreasoning mind; its chorus of indescribable sound seemed to rise from source unfathomable and to echo through eternity the cries of an endless wandering. Her stupor became heavier. Nature was kinder than her children; and while the poor body bled from their torture, she closed its windows and its doors for a time and took the spirit roving. There were bright green fields before her now; flowers of unearthly brightness bloomed all about her; waters fell in sweetest freshness and their music mingled with the song of birds. She danced along with the lightness of a sunbeam, and glanced through vapors of fragrance. Was this life-or was this death? Suddenly a shadow of intense blackness crossed her beautiful sky. The bird's song became a croak, the flowers were changed to toads, the zephyrs with which she played became the flapping of a raven's wing. Now the evil bird was at her side, it pecked the flesh from her hands and feet; now it lighted on her shoulder with its horrid, croaking laugh; and now-it wears the face of \n\nYealh-neddy! In a moment more he has buried his beak in her brain. She struggles, but her hands and her feet are bound with burning bands—she cannot move. In breathless agony she awakes! The night closes in awful thickness about her. The human cries mingle with the unearthly, melancholy, and prolonged yelps of a hundred Kling-get dogs and the hooting of the owls. She cannot at first distinguish or separate the soundsthey come to her like pulsations of the darkness. Her own miseries are as yet undefined. She does not\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nknow that the thongs are working into her flesh, that the atmosphere's humidity has bathed her still rigid body until the gathered moisture, all stained with blood from her wounds, is trickling to the earth from her bare limbs.

A word-a voice has had power to wake the nerves, to send life back into the brain channels which had been for a time deserted. She shudders with unspeakable horror as she recognizes the tones of Yealh-neddy. 66 So, so, my fair one, you are courting the raven tonight? He is a black lover for the rice-blossom.

From top to bottom they are carved with images representing the histories and traditions of their families; and in attitudes of peace or war may be seen the wolf, eagle, bear, petrel, whale, the frog, and many other birds and beasts. The whole crew is exhausted; and on reaching a cove more nearly in their course than Tongaas they run ashore, to find a little rest and refreshment. All efforts to build\na fire are fruitless-everything is water-soaked, and the driving rain extinguishes each long-coaxed flame. With a piece of dried salmon the weary men take to their wet blankets and lie down on the beach to sleep. After two hours, the storm still continuing, travel is resumed this time with the determination of reaching \n\nFort Simpson if possible. Getting out of cover of the island, they find a favoring wind, before which both sails are set, their corners dipping into the sea as they cut through the high-running waves. The masts bend and creak, but the sailors laugh. \"Beat steamboat-beat teamboat!\" the Tsimpseans cry. About the middle of the afternoon the joyful shout of \"Fort Simpson!\" comes from those who know it best, and in a very short time all have found warmth and welcome within its sheltering homes. Dry clothing and cooked food are among the comforts that all are prepared to appreciate. “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers,\" has been one of the well-learned lessons among these Christian Tsimpseans, and the weary, weather-beaten Chilkats are not forgotten by their fellow-travellers, who have now entered the secure haven of their own households. Yealh-neddy, Kah-sha, and Kin-da-shon have been taken to the comfortable house of Samuel, the man through whom the speaking has been done on the way from Fort Wrangel. Their white companion has found as warm a welcome with their missionary, while the other Chilkats have met equal kindness in other families. After their physical comforts have received attention, Samuel calls about him his wife and children, and, in the presence of their guests, takes down from a high shelf his\nKIN-DA-SHON'S WIFE: \n\nlittle family Bible. Seating himself near the lighted candle and opening the book, he looks up into the face of \n\nKah-sha, saying: \"Friend, it is the word of our God. We read it that he may speak to us, and then we speak to him.\" Yealh-neddy is called to give these words as best he can with his poor Chinook, and in reply Kah-sha answers in Kling-get: \"I thank you much if you will give me even a little of his word-my soul is more in need than my body has been this day; my heart is more cold, more hungry, more sick, more blind than my body can ever be. O friend, if you have medicine for sick souls, give me some before I die! I have seen you talking to your great Spirit—you have found one who makes you not afraid. I want to find him. I have all darkness; I want light. I hear you say one word many times, in gladness and in fear-Jesus'—what is that? Is it light? Is it love? Above all the boiling sea of men and devils, does it mean light and peace and help for crying souls? Tell me what you know!\" Leaning, with outstretched arm, toward the simpleminded man who has found Jesus precious to his soul, Kah-sha is trembling in his eagerness and weakness. Little as Samuel is able to gather of meaning from the words themselves, it is yet enough to give point to the excited, pleading manner of the man whose wan face speaks of speedy change. \"Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners,\"\n\nSamuel answers him, taking the trembling hand in his own. \"Jesus is the Son of God—and God so loved the world that he gave his only Son to save it.\" \"And can he save it?\" Kah-sha asks, his understanding quickened by soul-hunger. \"Can he save me?"}
