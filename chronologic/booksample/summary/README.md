summary
=======

This is at present just a stub for a module that will create summarization questions.

The method we use is to find paragraphs where the topic sentence is a good summary of the rest. Then we frame a question that presents the rest of the paragraph as material to be summarized, with the topic sentence as a ground-truth answer guaranteed to be in period style.
