questions.json has questions and ground-truth answers

questions.txt may be more human-readable and easier to edit

If you want to add a new question file, you could either create it in the ad-hoc .txt format I was using or create a .json file; either is fine. I have a utility to convert. I found the .txt format easier to write in because it required fewer {} [] , characters I could get wrong.

If you're actually adding directly to existing files, best to add to the json because my old questions.txt is no longer up to date.

lab_notebook.md contains records of fine-tuning jobs, etc
