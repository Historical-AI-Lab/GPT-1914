We have not forgotten it was the body-guard that brought us off at \n\nFontenoy!\" CHAPTER XXIV. THE TRICOLOR. AT Fontenoy! Yes, they identified themselves with the glory and the military history of France. These tradesmen of Paris, awkward and uneasy in stiff, tight uniforms, jostling each other in their formations like a flock of sheep, handling a musket with obvious fear of its recoil; assumed to themselves a share in the past triumphs of heroes who could hold their own with Marlborough's grenadiers, and check the picked cavalry of Prince Eugéne; who advanced into action with a hand of fiddles, curled, gloved, scented, and cravatted as if for a ball, and left their dead in hundreds wherever a battery was to be taken, or an outwork of the enemy carried by storm. Could there be one single sentiment in common between a Black Musketeer of Louis the Great, with his debts, his dandyism, his refined prejudices, his intrigues, his duels, his dainty scorn of death, and a respectable grocer, comfortable, thrifty, industrious, sorting goods, posting a ledger, and coming in regularly to his meals? Only this, that each was a Frenchman, and, as a Frenchman, set his country above everything on earth, except her military glory, which he loved even better than France. With six months' campaigning, and a few volleys fired in earnest, these citizens were hereafter to make the finest soldiers in Europe, but at present they were no match for a mere rabble, for a mob of ruffians commanded by Santerre, the scum and sweepings of the streets. THE TRICOLOR. 209 Red, white, and blue were the colours of the good city of Paris. Her national guards elected to wear them in a cockade, and thus originated the famous Tricolor, the flag that, torn to shreds by shot and shell, has floated triumphant in every part of the world where danger is to be encountered and honour won. As the cross to Crusaders, the crescent to Saracens, as our own unconquered Union Jack to sturdy Britons, is the Tricolor to the warlike sons of France. Where it waves there will they make their rush, loose in formation, firing as they advance, but pressing eagerly to the front. How many hearts have shed their life-blood to further it twenty paces in the charge, to preserve its honour unsullied in the retreat; how many eyes swimming in death, and watching it to the last, have taken its image with them into another world; how many noble spirits, swelling with pride and patriotism, have trooped gloriously into Paris under the remnants of their victorious flag!"}

Send him back with a guard into Paris!\" But Coupe-tête, for whom the favour of the mob was the very bread he ate, had disappeared; and already scowling brows and loud imprecations warned Montarbas that his own forbearance to a cassock was viewed with suspicion, as a symptom of insincerity, a leaning towards that reaction, the\nROSINE. fear of which drove the revolution deeper and deeper into an abyss of fire, from which anarchy and confusion were to reappear forged and moulded anew in the form of an iron despotism, all-powerful for evil, utterly hopeless and helpless for good. \"Down with the priest!\" they vociferated. \"Down with the cassock! Down with Montarbas, if he will take his part! They are aristocrats; they are in league to betray the nation. Treachery! treachery! Down with them both!\" It was a critical moment, and would have shaken the nerves of most men; yet Montarbas retained his coolness, his presence of mind, and that decision of character, that promptitude of action, right or wrong, which entitles men to command. . \"I can save you now, Monsieur,\" he whispered, \"if you will hold your tongue!\" \"Speak out, Count!\" answered the other, smiling scornfully; \"I will do my duty, whether or not you flinch from yours!\" 66 Montarbas shrugged his shoulders. \"The man is an enthusiast, a fanatic,\" said he, beckoning to Santerre, who came striding through the crowd. \"I cannot stay here to argue till sunrise. Take him to the rear and have him guarded-gagged if you like, and with his hands tied, but do not shed his blood. We might want him in an hour or two, if the aristocrats yonder are disposed to come to terms.\" Santerre shook his head. \"Who is Citizen Montarbas,\" growled this leader of ruffians, \"that I should take his orders? A noble! an aristocrat! What! a peer of France. He is not a man of the people. He is not one of us! Wait a bit, my little Count! Santerre has his eye on you. Perhaps it will take you all your time to look out for yourself!\" And here is the difficulty with which such leaders have to\ncontend. There is a downward impetus in its progress, that those who set a revolution in motion are powerless to arrest. So long as the agitator can make fresh promises, originate fresh changes, and incite to fresh outrage, so long is he adored by an unreasoning and enthusiastic crowd, who ask no better than to cheer themselves hoarse round their idol, swearing they will follow him to the death."}

ROSINE. What a contrast to her childhood, her youth, her early history; yet did it seem now a perfectly natural consequence that she should be the companion, the friend, the confidant of her beloved Sovereign. It is strange how soon humanity accommodates itself to changes that would have once been accounted simple impossibilities. The incredible in anticipation becomes almost commonplace when we look back, and it is not too much to say that no man was ever yet raised to a pinnacle he esteemed one inch too high for his merits, or placed in so unexpected a position, but that he felt he had realised something of the same kind before. It takes a culprit scarcely ten minutes to recover the effects of a sentence of death. Mother Redcap with her apron wrapped about her head, nodded placidly over a bivouac fire; Santerre ordered rations of brandy for his ruffians with the composure of a publican serving at his bar; Coupe-tête, though not without misgivings of to-morrow, while congratulating himself there had been no attack to-night, made thoughtful arrangements for his supper and his bed; Count Arnold wrote orders on a drumhead with unclouded brain and unfaltering hand. Léonie, hoping and caring for nothing but that she might live or die at his side, it little mattered which, looked at the peaceful moon, and wondered vaguely how all this was to end; Pierre pipeclayed his belts, whistled softly the while, and ran his finger approvingly over the point and edges of his pike; Rosine prayed in silence to the\n\nVirgin, listening for every sound; and Marie Antoinette slept. Half-sitting, half-reclining, propped against the sofacushions, she seemed rather insensible from moral and physical exhaustion, than sunk in healthy repose.

How solemn the hollow, faded eyes, with their drooping lids, weighed down, as it were, under the burden of shed and unshed tears, expressing, even in sleep, their hopeless yearning for relief, for rest-never to open on this weary world again! How touching those broad patches of grey in the rich brown hair, marks of the destroyer who had passed like a flame over her fairest years, withering the promise of youth, and blasting the glory of womanhood into a scorched and dreary waste! It was a fair and noble head even now, dainty, graceful, womanly; a head for a lover to caress, for a crown to encircle, for a multitude to adore; not a head to be polluted by the touch of the executioner, and rolled in the sawdust of the guillotine.

He had trudged through the snow to pay his accustomed visit, dressed even more carefully than usual-for it was his maxim to be abrupt with a duchess, but ceremonious with a dairymaid and had found the hearth fireless, the house untenanted. It was some time before he could realise the trick thus played on him, before he could believe it possible that his own people should have dared to decline his favours, and repudiate his authority. Only after research and inquiry did he become convinced of the fact that Pierre Legros had decamped with his promised bride, to some hiding-place beyond the reach of feudal superiority and its hateful privileges. It is difficult enough for the red man to destroy his trail as he leaves it behind him in the wilderness, covering the foot prints with leaves and grass, traversing to and fro, winding in and out to baffle his enemy; but in a civilised country money and influence can wrest information from the very bird of the air; and a fugitive may no more hope to elude pursuit than a hunted deer with a pack of bloodhounds on her track. In a few days Count Arnold had ascertained that Rosine's destination was Paris. In a few more he was himself at the Hotel Montarbas, within a musket-shot of the Tuileries; and but for the exigencies of rank, which obliged him to wait on their majesties at the earliest opportunity, he would have been at this moment seeking his prey through the alleys and suburbs of the capital, rather than exchanging compliments with a mob of lords and ladies in the ante-room of the Queen's apartments at Versailles.

While he bounded to her assistance with long elastic leaps, he noticed a sweet face, rosy red with exercise, a pair of dark eyes sparkling with excitement, slim feet, straight ankles, and under a scarlet cloak, flapping riotously in the gale, the shapely supple figure that belongs to a well-built girl of nineteen. \"Pardon, mademoiselle! Permit me to offer my assistance; there-take my hand in yours; don't be afraid of hurting me, I can bear a good deal of squeezing without crying out. Excuse me if I embrace you too tightly: from such a situation one is only extricated by main force. Now that you stand again on solid ground, I venture to present myself—the Count Montarbas, at your service. I live within ten minutes' walk: if mademoiselle has far to go, need I say that my house and its master are wholly at her disposal?\" They were standing together on a firm wind-swept space beneath a tree. While he stamped and shook the snow from his boots and shooting-dress, she had leisure to examine her new acquaintance furtively, from under her eyelashes, observing, without looking, as only a woman can. Yes, he was handsome, there could be no question. Slight, graceful, well-proportioned, with an air of confident, careless goodnature that possessed a certain charm. More experienced perceptions would have read profligate in every line of that delicate high-bred face, but she only saw a refined beauty, too feminine perhaps for her taste, and the polish of a society she never hoped and scarcely wished to enter. Altogether she retained her presence of mind very creditably for a \"girl of the people,\" just pulled out of the snow by a peer of France! B 2\nROSINE. \"I thank you, monsieur,\" she said, drawing herself up, keeping him, as it were, at arm's length. \"I, too, have very little farther to go, and I would not, for all the world, that you should walk a step out of your way on my account. Again I thank you, Monsieur le Comte, a thousand times, and-and-I wish you good evening, monsieur; they will be anxious about me at home.\" \"You are in a hurry, mademoiselle,\" he answered lightly, \"so am I; we will walk fast, but we will walk together. I cannot suffer you to be alone with all these wolves. Look at their tracks. Are you not afraid, or have you, with the face of a Hebe, the heart of a grenadier ?”\n\nShe did not know what a Hebe meant, but his gaiety was catching, and she replied with a laugh, checked even as it rose: \"There are wolves of many kinds, monsieur, in these forests. Some go about on two legs and in sheeps' clothing -these, I am told, are the hungriest and most dangerous.\" \"Meaning me!\" he exclaimed. \"Ah, mademoiselle! what a good chance for the wolf to wear fleecy hosiery in such cold as this! But see! he takes off his sheepskin to shelter you. Have you not a kind word for him now ?\" While he spoke, he stripped off a loose upper jacket lined with fur, and wrapped it round her shoulders, as another blast drove its snow-cloud over their heads. She could not but be grateful for the attention; nor, indeed, could she fail to remark the neat, well-chosen dress and symmetrical figure that he thus exposed to the storm. \"It is too much, monsieur,\" she murmured; \"too much kindness, too much honour. Do you know who I am?\" \"Red Riding-hood, I believe,\" he replied. \"Will you not take me to the cottage and present me to the grandmother? Even if I am a wolf, as you seem to think, I couldn't eat a grandmother!\" THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. 5 She laughed out now, and the laugh, with her dimples and white teeth, was pleasant to see as well as hear. \"But we are \"You shouldn't eat mine,\" she answered. not afraid of wolves in our little cottage. We have a sheep-dog that takes them by the throat.\" \"And his name?"}

We cannot make our circle too large, nor the links too strong; they may have to bear a heavier strain than you suppose.

A dull grey hue crept over his face, as a mist from the water creeps over some Flemish landscape, and his countenance, never very animated, assumed that expression of powerlessness and apathy which with a sick man is considered the forerunner of death. He sat for some minutes in silence, then roused himself with an effort like one who wakes from a dream. \"Be it so, Madame,\" said he. \"Give what directions you will, and please yourself. Who knows how long I may be able to indulge you? It shall never be said that one of my last acts of authority was to thwart the dearest and the fairest and the best of wives in a matter like this!\" She had been the Queen a moment ago.

We are not to be separated, you and I, in life or death. But courage, Monsieur. Why do I speak of falling and dying? We need but a little prudence, firmness, and policy to conquer and to live. The nobles are true as yet, the good tradespeople have everything to lose by our discomfiture; and, for the lower classes-see, spring is coming on; with warmer weather will vanish cold and starvation, our bitterest enemies in the palace, as theirs in the hovel. Wise measures, my husband, dictated by foresight-not fear—and, above all, a strong hand at the helm, will guide us safely through the storm.” \"But for the boy,\" he mused, \"I would abdicate, and have done with it.
