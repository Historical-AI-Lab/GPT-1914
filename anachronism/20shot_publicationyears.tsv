It is, therefore, entirely misleading to think that we really perceive that which is offered to our senses. We perceive of it just as much as we are prepared to perceive, and our preparation depends upon our general conceptions which control our modes of motor behaviour. We perceive just what we are seeking. Ever so many adults move in the midst of nature and do not see anything of the differences of the flowers or of the birds, and their interest is not in the least stirred up by the physical and chemical phenomena which surround them. Their education and their life work has not trained them in reacting on those differences, and that upon which they are not reacting does not exist for them.	Thus, perception is not merely a passive reception of data; it is an active process shaped by our preconceptions, our knowledge, and our attentiveness. The mind, rather than being a blank slate upon which the world imprints itself, is more akin to a lens, filtering and interpreting sensory information through the framework of previous experiences and cultural conditioning. This selective attention implies that much of what surrounds us in the world is virtually invisible unless we have been conditioned to look for it. For instance, a botanist walks through a forest and notices subtle differences in foliage, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, or the signs of a disease on a plant—details that are completely lost on someone without that training. Similarly, an artist might perceive variations in color and shadow that others might overlook. This demonstrates that our perceptions are not simply about receiving light through our eyes, but about what our brains are prepared to handle. Education, interest, and professional focus all play crucial roles in determining what we notice and what escapes our attention. It is through this lens that we construct our reality, constantly interpreting	1909	2005.6683
"So, at last, we see "" The Twentieth Century pressing the English Rose between the pages of History."" The lesson is needed: whether even "" Max, "" who shows he can teach it, can make the nation learn, time alone can show. If the nation can be roused, if it is again to be strong, not only in war, but in the time of peace, when the fate of war is decided, perhaps the cartoon of "" Darby and Joan at Dover Castle "" might do it. Else when the next struggle for the existence of the Empire comes, perhaps "" Max's "" revised version of "" St. George and the Dragon "" may come true, and the Dragon make a mouthful of the Knight "" The Second Childhood of John Bull"" contains the caricaturist's most ambitious work, and it is throughout instinct with humour and informed by a clear insight into the truth of the state of things. It is presented in a worthy setting, in a handsome folio volume, which enables the cartoons, reproduced in colour, to be given without reduction from the original size. LEWIS MELVILLE. The New Order. II."	"The Times are Changed. The world has turned over many times since the days of old when John Bull might have sat comfortably by his fireside, undisturbed by the rumblings beyond his own borders. The new era demands vigilance and readiness, traits which the Empire must embody if it is to maintain its position on the global stage. The New Order calls for a reawakening, a transformation from the complacent Darby and Joan model to one of keen perception and proactive engagement. The cartoons of ""Max"" serve not merely as critiques but as rallying cries, urging the nation to shed its lethargic cloak and don the armor of foresight and innovation. The need for change is palpable, pressing against the confines of tradition and comfort. As the Empire faces challenges both from within and without, the response cannot be passive. It must be a dynamic thrust towards modernization and strength, lest the dragon of complacency devours the knight of progress.

What area of cross section of steel will bring the neutral axis of the section in the plane of the under side of the floor ? What would then be the intensity of tension in the steel when the maximum compression reaches 600 lbs. per square inch ? 16. A reinforced concrete beam of T section has the cross piece 24 inches wide and 5 inches deep, the remainder being 10 inches wide by 18 inches deep. The reinforcement consists of two 2 inch round bars placed with their centres 3 inches from the lower face of the beam. Find the intensity of tension in the steel and moment of resistance of the section when the extreme compressive stress in the concrete reaches 600 lbs. per square inch. 17.	To solve this problem, we need to analyze the cross-sectional properties of the T-section reinforced concrete beam and apply principles from reinforced concrete design, particularly focusing on the balance of stresses and strains in the concrete and steel to maintain equilibrium and compatibility. **Step 1: Calculate the properties of the cross-section** - Width of the flange (b_f) = 24 inches - Thickness of the flange (t_f) = 5 inches - Width of the web (b_w) = 10 inches - Total height of beam (h) = 18 inches - Effective depth (d) = h - 3 inches (distance from the top to the centroid of steel) = 18 - 3 = 15 inches - Area of steel (A_s) = 2 * π * (2/2)^2 = 2 * 3.1416 * 1^2 = 6.2832 square inches **Step 2: Calculate the neutral axis (NA) position** For a T-beam, the NA can lie in	1908	1998.0632
Theorem (1). — The moment of inertia of any plane area about any axis in its plane exceeds that about a parallel line through its centre of gravity (or centroid) by an amount equal to the product of the area and the square of the distance of the centroid from the axis. Otherwise, if I is the moment of inertia of an area A about any axis in the plane of the figure, and IG is the moment of inertia about a parallel axis through the centroid, and / is the distance between the two axes — I = I + A (1) or, dividing each term by A — & = k? f P (2)  112 [CH. V. STRENGTH OF MATERIALS. where k is the radius of gyration about any axis distant / from the centroid and kg that about a parallel axis through the centroid.	Corollary (1). — From the theorem, it is evident that the radius of gyration about any axis can be determined if the radius of gyration about a parallel axis through the centroid and the distance between the axes are known. This provides a practical method for calculating the moment of inertia for complex shapes, as it allows for the decomposition of the shape into simpler parts whose centroids and radii of gyration are easier to determine. Proof of Theorem (1). — Consider a plane area A, and let \( I \) be its moment of inertia about an arbitrary axis in the plane of the area. Let \( I_G \) be the moment of inertia about a parallel axis through the centroid of the area, and let \( d \) represent the perpendicular distance between the two axes. By the parallel axis theorem, the moment of inertia \( I \) about the arbitrary axis can be expressed as: \[ I = I_G + Ad^2 \] where \( A \) is the area of the shape, and \( d \) is the distance from the centroid to the	1908	1975.8492
"""It now develops, according to charges sent here from Cincinnati, that Mr. Maxwell is the retained attorney of the Adams Express Company and the Southern Express Company, and has appeared as counsel for the American Express Company. ""In view of the fact that any action by the government which tends to force the magazines out of the mails drives them of necessity to use the express companies for transportation purposes, the manifest impropriety of appointing an express company attorney upon this commission must impress itself upon every one. ""The scandal, however, is greater than this. It is now generally recognised that the government has played directly into the hands of the express companies in refusing to establish a parcels post and to exercise the right of monopoly conferred upon it to transport all mail matter. It has also been recognised that  175 the influence of the express companies has prevented the establishment of a parcels post."	The appointment of Mr. Maxwell, therefore, seems to many as not merely an oversight but as a deliberate move to ensure that the interests of the express companies continue to be well-represented at the highest levels of decision-making. Critics argue that this not only undermines the integrity of the commission but also perpetuates the monopolistic practices that have long been criticized in the express transport industry. Furthermore, the situation raises significant concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest, as Mr. Maxwell's dual roles could compromise his ability to impartially execute his duties on the commission. This intertwining of corporate and government interests is seen by many as a threat to the democratic process, where public officials should serve the public good rather than corporate benefactors. In response to these allegations, several civic groups and independent lawmakers have called for a thorough investigation into the appointment processes for such commissions. They demand transparency and rigorous checks to prevent similar occurrences in the future, emphasizing the need for representatives who are free from corporate ties and who can impartially advocate for the public's needs. This controversy highlights the ongoing struggle between corporate influence and	1911	1991.6437

""No, "" said Alonzo, ""I never see anybody like you neither — so pretty nor so soft nor so just right every way."""	"Alma blushed, her cheeks turning a shade pinker, her eyes dropping to the floor before they met his again, filled with a mixture of surprise and affection. ""You really think so, 'Lonzo?

"Wearing a fez, one may pass unheeded in the court. An Englishman who loves this land and its people led me to Eyoub one perfect July day. Women were feeding the pigeons, believing this a potent act that would bring news from distant friends. Pilgrims passed in, resting upon their staves and murmuring. ""Allah, Allah, "" as they passed within the gate. In a corner of the outer court is a door painted in green and gold, guarded by a crimson curtain. Here women alone may enter, and as they pass within they leave their shoes in charge of a turbaned man. Next to this is a turbeh, or tomb of a saint, open to view, but always guarded by a priest."	The priest, a grave figure in flowing robes, sits against the vivid tiles that line the walls, his prayer beads slipping quietly through his fingers as he watches. Those who come to pay their respects enter with a respectful hush, their voices lowered to whispers as they approach the tomb. The air is thick with the scent of incense, and small candles flicker in niches, casting a soft, reverent light across the intricately carved stone of the tomb itself. Beyond this sacred place, the complex of Eyoub stretches out, encompassing gardens and smaller chapels, each with their own guardians and rituals. The sound of water from a nearby fountain blends with the distant calls of the muezzin, creating a tapestry of sound that seems to encapsulate the spirit of the place. Here, the bustle of Istanbul feels worlds away, and time itself seems to slow, bending to the rhythm of prayer and the slow, measured pace of those who come seeking solace and connection with the divine.

William determined not only to establish his defence by the method of de vastation, but to establish it at once, winter though it was, and systematically all the arable land between the Yorkshire Wolds and the Pennines, from the left bank of the Ouse up to the Tees, from the Tees up to the Tyne, he utterly wasted. The whole population of Durham fled to the islands off the coast, save such as were cut down in their flight, and they were thousands. He burnt every steading and destroyed every implement his hand could reach. The chiefs submitted, the greatest of them was permitted a marriage into the Conqueror's family, and while his men raided Northumberland the King himself returned from the Tees, not following the road of the plains by which he had come, but showing himself and his power, in spite of the desperate weather, up in the Yorkshire dales, which are the foothills of the Peninnes. This last was a desperate venture in which the army was almost destroyed by the climate, and William himself once lost.	Yet, the sheer audacity of it cemented his control, imposing a fearful respect among those who survived to tell the tale. As he emerged from the dales, the stark reality of his scorched earth policy became evident. The land was bereft of life, a barren expanse that once teemed with the bustle of English yeomen and their families. The silence was profound, broken only by the harsh winter wind that carried the faint echoes of despair. The strategy, brutal though it was, had its desired effect. Resistance waned rapidly in the face of such overwhelming force and ruthlessness. The northern lords, witnessing the futility of opposition and the dire consequences of defiance, bent the knee one by one. William's hold over the north was secured, not just by military might, but by inducing an almost palpable fear that whispered of the futility of rebellion against his rule. This period, though stark, was also one of significant administrative organization. William took measures to fortify his position further by building castles at strategic locations, installing loyal Norman barons to oversee them	1912	1957.0408
In such cases the high illumination mentioned by Mr. Goodenongh would be very much appreciated. 233 MR. J. S. Dow (communicated). — A distinct advantage of indirect lighting systems is doubtless the ease with which light can penetrate into remote corners. On the other hand, it appears just possible that this very quality might not be the most suitable for illuminating compositors' frames, and for tables on which type is examined. In such cases, one might suppose, light coming from a small source and therefore casting fairly sharp shadows, would be preferable in distinguishing and picking out from the frame small type. But light coming from a very extensive area would naturally be better for getting into crannies and illuminating complicated machinery. Another matter that deserves attention is the direct reflection from the type. This is found to be particularly troublesome if the lamps are not judiciously placed.	234 MR. R. H. THOMPSON (communicated). — In continuation of Mr. Dow's observations, it is essential to consider the quality of light in relation to the specific tasks undertaken within a workspace. While soft, diffused lighting from a broad source minimizes shadows and reduces eye strain in general settings, tasks requiring acute visual precision, such as typesetting or detailed mechanical work, may benefit from more directed lighting. This allows for better contrast and clarity, which are crucial in spotting minor discrepancies or fine details. Furthermore, the placement and angle of lighting sources can dramatically affect the efficiency with which light is utilized. Improper arrangement can lead to significant glare, which not only hampers visibility but also leads to increased fatigue over prolonged periods. Therefore, adjustable and well-positioned task lighting should be considered alongside ambient lighting to optimize both comfort and functionality in industrial and office settings. 235 MR. A. F. GILMORE (communicated). — Another aspect that merits discussion is the color temperature of the lighting used. Different color temperatures can influence mood and perceived brightness, which in	1912	2000.9897
The word “tort” includes acts of trespass, trover, false imprisonment, assault and battery, slander, deceit, etc. Under that law it has been held that a complaint alleging that a contractor was prevented by owner from performing work under his contract and asking damages resulting from the loss of profits which he expected to make was an action in tort, which did not survive the death of the owner It has been held that if by reason of a tort the estate of the deceased person has derived pecuniary profits, that the representative could be compelled to account to the party injured.’ 13. Assignee of Contractor or owner.	The rights and liabilities of an assignee in cases of tort are significantly different from those in contract. While contractual rights and obligations can generally be assigned, tortious claims and liabilities are inherently personal to the parties involved and thus are typically not assignable. This is rooted in the principle that tort actions are based on the breach of duties owed to specific individuals rather than on the breach of obligations under a contract.  However, there are exceptions to this general rule. For instance, if the tort involves property damage, the right to claim compensation for such damage may be transferred along with the property itself. Similarly, in cases where a tort results in a financial loss that reduces the value of an asset, the right to sue for that loss may be assigned along with the asset. In the context of a contractor or owner, if the contractor has assigned his contractual rights to another party, that assignee steps into the shoes of the contractor and may have the right to complete the work under the contract. However, the assignee would not automatically inherit any tort claims the contractor might have against the owner unless those claims are	1913	1987.7291

This approach not only enhances the visual comfort for visitors but also preserves the ambiance of the space, ensuring that the lighting does not overpower the intrinsic character of the library environment. Additionally, the use of LED technology in these fixtures contributes to energy efficiency without sacrificing the quality of light. It is imperative that the lighting not only serves the functional purpose of visibility but also contributes to the conservation of resources, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals. For areas within the library that require more focused light, such as cataloging desks or computer stations, task lighting solutions are implemented. These are adjustable and provide a higher intensity of light directly where needed, ensuring that all activities, whether reading physical books or working on digital interfaces, are adequately supported by the appropriate lighting levels	1912	2005.8636
The teacher must never forget that the words or figures which he writes on the blackboard may be the intended help to the memory of merely one third of his class; there may be another third which would profit more if they heard the sounds from the human voice, and the remainder would retain them much better if they had a chance to speak or write them. The laboratory shows that these latter gain the advantage even if the writing is not visible, but perhaps done with a piece of wood on the desk. The natural tendency of every teacher to put emphasis on the special scheme for which he is born must be a severe injustice to a large fraction. CHAPTER XVII  All remembering, we said, is a reproduction of earlier impressions, with the consciousness of the reference to the past. Most of our mental reproductions lack this temporal reference.	They appear in the flow of thought as mere images or concepts without a clear tie to when they first entered our cognition. This is particularly evident in cases of learning where information is assimilated without a vivid or specific memory of the moment of learning. This type of memory, often referred to as implicit memory, contrasts sharply with explicit memory where the recall is of a specific event, complete with the contextual details of the 'when' and 'where.' For the educator, this distinction is crucial. It suggests that teaching methods need to be diversified to cater to these varying types of memory retention. Some students may thrive on clear, chronological recounting of events, which enhances their explicit memory. Others might benefit from repetitive practice which strengthens implicit memory pathways, allowing them to perform tasks without conscious thought about the steps involved. Furthermore, the act of remembering is influenced not just by the initial encoding of information, but also by the retrieval conditions. Contextual cues, emotional states, and the similarity between learning and recall environments can all significantly impact the ability to retrieve stored information. This implies that learning environments should be rich in	1909	2007.5757
"It is preferable to employ the conception of "" relative efficiency, "" the ratio of the above quantity to the volume of the airship. The "" relative efficiency"" is a pure number, in the above case i nearly. Vertical ""empennage"" or fin. — The condition as regards stability in the horizontal plane is even worse. In the first place, an airship never has the form of a solid of revolution ; under the gas pressure and other forces the section is usually pear shaped, the horizontal diameter being reduced in length and raised. 380 The lateral force and reversing couple are proportionately increased, tn the second place there is no static restoring moment. The fin efficiency necessary should thus exceed 1 of the volume. Actually it is never so large. For la Belgique III it is for the Parseval ships I of the volume."	For the Zeppelin class, the efficiency is somewhat higher, but still not optimal. This highlights a critical aspect of airship design that often gets overlooked: the balance between structural integrity and aerodynamic efficiency. The challenge lies in designing a fin that not only provides adequate stability but also integrates seamlessly with the overall aerodynamics of the vessel. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the vertical fin is also influenced by its positioning relative to the center of gravity and the overall length of the airship. A fin placed too far forward or too back can lead to increased drag or decreased stability, respectively. The optimal placement is typically a calculated compromise based on the specific flight dynamics of each airship model. In practice, the design of the vertical empennage must also consider the dynamic forces experienced during maneuvers and environmental interactions such as wind gusts or thermal effects. These factors can induce additional pitch and yaw movements that the fin must counteract to maintain course stability. Thus, while the static design calculations provide a baseline, real-world performance often requires adjustments and iterative refinements. This iterative process is crucial for achieving a design that	1912	2006.4396
There we have variations which are characteristic for life. Children, as well as adults, have this tendency to  153   move in their ideas either to coordinated, or to superordi nated, or to subordinated, ideas. But this general tendency must prepare the children in very different ways for particular studies, and, as we may add at once, for particular callings in life. The one type of association will lead the mind from the special case to the general ideas, the other type will rather lead from the general to the special. Even among the great thinkers we find such fundamental differences. There are inductive and deductive minds, there are born observers, and born speculators, and born inventory, and born experimenters, and born philosophers; and all these great differences show themselves in miniature copies in every classroom.	The teacher who is aware of these distinctions can adapt his methods to the varied tendencies of his pupils, thereby enhancing their natural inclinations and strengths. It becomes crucial, then, for educators to not only recognize these differences but to cultivate an environment where each type of thinker can thrive and contribute uniquely. This understanding also aids in guiding students towards career paths that align with their innate skills and modes of thinking, thereby increasing the likelihood of professional satisfaction and success in their future endeavors. For instance, children who show a natural propensity for inductive reasoning may excel in scientific fields where they can hypothesize and test theories based on observed phenomena. Conversely, those with a knack for deductive reasoning might find themselves more comfortable in disciplines such as mathematics or computer science, where principles are applied to solve specific problems. Similarly, students who are natural-born experimenters might be encouraged to pursue engineering or applied sciences, where hands-on work and innovation are prevalent. Thus, the role of education should be dual: to expand the student's base of knowledge, and equally, to refine and direct their inherent cognitive styles towards areas where they	1909	1992.5736
How organise if possible, in each, in all, at any rate here and there among ourselves to begin with, some such common understanding as to the methods as are needed to make observations at all, and to compare and generalise them ? As regards the description of Cities there are vast materials in literature; travellers and geographers, archaeologists and historians, artists and art critics, are all available to us. From Herodotus to Gibbon, from Pausanias to Schliemann and Arthur Evans, or from John Ray to Ruskin, indeed to the latest writers, there is no lack of help towards visualising cities, whether past or present, nor even of entering into their life, be this buried or no.	Yet, despite this abundance of sources, the true challenge lies in synthesizing these diverse accounts into a coherent whole that not only represents the physical aspects of cities but also captures the essence of their cultural and social dynamics. To organize and facilitate such an endeavor, a systematic approach is essential. Firstly, a collaborative network of scholars and experts from various disciplines should be established. This network would function as a forum for exchanging ideas, methodologies, and findings, thereby fostering interdisciplinary research and understanding. Secondly, it is imperative to develop a standardized method for documenting and analyzing urban spaces. This would involve creating a common framework that includes guidelines for data collection, criteria for selecting significant features of cities, and techniques for interpreting historical and contemporary narratives. Such a framework should be flexible enough to accommodate the unique characteristics of different cities while maintaining consistency in the way information is gathered and presented. Furthermore, the use of modern technology can greatly enhance our ability to study and compare cities. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), for instance, can be employed to map and analyze spatial data, while digital archives can facilitate the preservation and accessibility of historical	1908	2007.2389
It is not solitary, but social; and so we can never have it without sharing it with others. iv. It is the result of God's will for us, and not of our will for ourselves; and so we can only find it by giving our lives up, in submission and obedience, to the control of God. For this is peace, — to lose the lonely note Of self in love's celestial ordered strain: And this is joy, — to find one's self again In Him whose harmonies forever float Through all the spheres of song, below, above, — For God is music, even as God is love. This is the divine doctrine of happiness as Christ taught it by His life and with His lips.	It is a happiness that does not derive from external circumstances, nor from the fleeting pleasures of the world, but from a deep and abiding connection with the divine. This joy, once it is rooted in the soul, is not easily shaken by the trials and tribulations of life. Rather, it offers a steadfast serenity that endures through all seasons of existence. The teachings of Christ emphasize the importance of love, compassion, and humility. By embodying these virtues, we align ourselves with God's will, and in doing so, we open ourselves to the true joy that comes from divine union. This joy transcends mere emotional states; it is a profound realization of our place in a larger, sacred order. Thus, the path to genuine happiness is found not in self-seeking, but in self-giving. It is not in asserting our own desires, but in surrendering to a higher purpose. In this surrender, we do not lose ourselves, but rather, we discover our true selves in relation to the Creator. This discovery brings with it a peace that surpasses all understanding—a peace	1908	1879.5236
But this story, as well as that of the rise and world wide growth of Christian Science, must be reserved for a future paper, as in the present outline sketch it is only possible to deal briefly with the life of the founder of Christian Science. On the Fourth of July, 1876, the Christian Science Association was formed, and three years later, in 1879, the Church of Christ Scientist was incorporated under a charter from the state, and Boston soon became its home and the chief working centre of the new movement. If after the publication of Science and Health the author looked forward to a peaceful and harmonious spread of the philosophy which she profoundly believed was destined to result in a revolutionary religious renaissance, she was doomed to disappointment, for probably at no time in her life did the storm of mental inharmony and opposition rage with greater force in her immediate atmosphere than during the years directly preceding and following the publication of Science and Health.	The challenges she faced were manifold. Critics from both religious and medical establishments vehemently opposed her teachings, which they viewed as radical and unorthodox. Newspapers published scathing articles, and some communities barred her from speaking. Despite these adversities, her conviction remained unshaken, and she continued to write, teach, and expand her ideas. Mary Baker Eddy's resilience was evident through her persistent efforts to establish a solid foundation for Christian Science. She organized the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in 1881, where she taught the principles of Christian Science to hundreds of students. Her role as a teacher and a leader crystallized during this period, and she devoted herself to refining the doctrines of Christian Science, emphasizing the role of mind in the healing process and the unreality of material existence. As she advanced her teachings, Mary Baker Eddy also worked on revising and expanding her seminal work, Science and Health. Each edition reflected deeper insights and clearer articulation of her spiritual understanding. This book, along with her relentless dedication, played a crucial role in garnering followers who experienced healing and	1911	1974.2001
The public must be warned against trusting the representations of such persons, and may rest assured that their claims receive no support whatever from the Council of the Illuminating Engineering Society. 276 A State Committee on the Hygienic Aspects of Lighting. On pp. 284, 285 readers will find the text of several very important questions asked in the House of Commons by Mr. A. Lynch, M.P.. on May 16th. The first of these related to the prevalence of miners' mystagmus which recent investigations by Dr. Llewellyn, Dr. Court, thelateDr. Thompson of Cardiff, and others ascribe to the inadequate lighting from miners' lamps.	The second question concerned the governmental regulation of lighting in factories and workshops, particularly with regard to the protection of workers' eyesight. Mr. Lynch emphasized the need for improved standards, citing recent studies showing a high incidence of eye strain and related disorders among industrial workers due to poor lighting conditions. In his third question, Mr. Lynch asked about the steps being taken to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Lighting, which had submitted its report earlier in the year. The commission had made several suggestions for improving both natural and artificial lighting in public buildings and homes, as well as in industrial settings. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, responding to Mr. Lynch's inquiries, assured the House that the government was actively reviewing the findings of the Royal Commission and other recent research. He acknowledged the critical role of lighting in health and safety, and he promised that new regulations and guidelines would be developed to address these concerns. Furthermore, he mentioned ongoing collaborations with the Illuminating Engineering Society and other expert bodies to ensure that any new standards would be based on the latest scientific evidence and best practices in the	1912	1985.1445
As to the first, what we have need to note most carefully is the all importance of the four Thames castles for the king and the all importance of London for the Barons. It was in the summer of 1214 that John's last attempt to retrieve his continental   disasters which, more than any oppression of his at home, had given the great nobles their cause of offence, was crushed at the battle of Bouvines. In the following January, a conspiracy having already been formed against his rule and an oath against him taken in particular by the nobles of the north, John came to a truce with the conspirators and fixed Low Sunday, the 26th of April, as the date upon which the truce should end. On the Saturday before Palm Sunday, that is, on the lithos April, 1215, the nobles gathered a force numbering anything from 2000 to 3000 men-at-arms — which would mean from 10,000 to 12,000 all told in their command.	"It was a formidable gathering, indeed, that threatened to march on London itself. The Barons, under the leadership of Robert FitzWalter, who styled himself the ""Marshal of the Army of God and Holy Church,"" were resolute and prepared for what might very well become a protracted conflict. They were united by their shared grievances against King John, grievances that had been exacerbated by years of heavy taxation, arbitrary justice, and the failed military campaigns abroad. As Easter approached, the tension was palpable. London was the prize that both parties eyed fervently. For the Barons, control of the city meant leverage—a means to press their demands. For John, retaining London was crucial for maintaining his shaky hold on power. The city was not just the economic heart of the kingdom but also a symbol of royal authority. To this end, John attempted to negotiate, sending letters filled with promises of reform and good governance. However, his reputation for deceit had preceded him, and few were inclined to believe his assurances. Instead, the Barons pressed forward, their ranks swelled by discontented knights"	1912	1956.5177
But if the hardy kinds of apple are budded on ordinary seedlings which are not hardy, then there is a part of the tender seedling which is aboveground and is liable to be killed out by cold. In this case, the resulting tree would be much improved if the seedling root had been grafted below ground instead of being budded above, so as to have the benefit of the protection the ground affords. On the other hand, where hardy trees are budded on the branches to change the bearing, the work is just as sure as if grafted. It is foolish, then, to pay more money for a budded than a grafted tree. Grafting is distinguished from budding by being performed at a season of the year, generally in the spring, when vegetation is dormant at least, when the plant operated not in full leaf; but there are many exceptions  Fig. 81. Method used in ring budding.	In ring budding, a ring of bark is removed from the stock, and a similar ring from the scion, which includes not only the bark but a thin layer of wood as well. The scion ring is then fitted into the place from which the ring was removed on the stock. This method ensures a larger contact area between the cambium layers of the scion and the stock, promoting a higher likelihood of successful union. Care must be taken to align the cambium layers as precisely as possible, as this is crucial for the transport of nutrients and water between the graft and the rootstock. After the scion is placed, it is bound tightly with grafting tape or a similar material to hold it in place and prevent desiccation. The wound is then typically covered with grafting wax or a sealant to further reduce moisture loss and to protect the exposed tissues from pathogens and pests. This technique is particularly useful for species that are difficult to graft by other methods and can be used not only for fruit trees but also for ornamental trees where a specific branching structure or variety is desired.	1914	1969.5958
The usual arrangement applicable to long thin rods is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 226. The upper end of a wire is firmly clamped in a vertical position, and the lower end is clamped to a drum or pulley, to which a couple, having the wire as axis, is applied by horizontal cords passing over pulleys and carrying equal weights in scale pans. The twist of the lower end of the wire may be measured by the movement past a fixed pointer of a graduated dial attached to the drum, and to avoid any effects of possible slipping in the top clamp a horizontal pointer may be attached to the wire near the upper end; the movement of this pointer over  44Q a fixed dial, subtracted from the angular movement of the lower end, gives the twist in the length between the two points of observation. , Kinetic Method. — The torsional stiffness, and hence the modulus of rigidity, may also be obtained by observing the period of torsional oscillation of a mass of known moment of inertia at the free end of a wire fixed at the upper end (see Art. 181). 180.	The oscillating body, when displaced from its equilibrium position and released, will perform torsional oscillations about the axis of the wire. By measuring the period of these oscillations, the torsional stiffness of the wire can be calculated. The period of oscillation \(T\) is given by the formula \(T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{I}{k}}\), where \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the oscillating mass and \(k\) is the torsional stiffness of the wire. From this, the modulus of rigidity \(G\) can be determined using the relationship \(k = \frac{GJ}{L}\), where \(J\) is the polar moment of inertia of the wire and \(L\) is the length of the wire between the fixed point and the mass. This kinetic method is particularly useful when dealing with materials that may suffer from slippage or other forms of mechanical instability when subjected to static torsional tests. The dynamic nature of the kinetic method allows for the characterization of the material under conditions that more closely resemble those found in real	1908	1978.5282
— A wooden plank 12 inches wide, 4 inches deep, and 10 feet long, is suspended from a rigid support by three wires, each of  which is \ of a square inch in section and 15 feet long, one being at each end, and one midway between them. All the wires being just drawn up tight, a uniform load of 400 lbs. per foot run is placed on the plank. Neglecting the weight of the wood, find the tension in the central and end wires, and the greatest intensity of bending stress in the plank, the direct modulus of elasticity (E) for the wires being 20 times that for the wood.	To solve this problem, let's begin by calculating the total load on the plank. Given that the plank is 10 feet long with a uniform load of 400 lbs. per foot, the total load \( W \) is: \[ W = 400 \, \text{lbs/foot} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 4000 \, \text{lbs} \] This load is evenly distributed along the length of the plank. The plank is supported by three wires, so the load will be distributed among these supports. Assuming the load is evenly distributed and each support carries an equal load, each wire would support one-third of the total load. However, due to the symmetry and the bending moment in the beam, the central wire will carry a larger portion of the load. ### Calculation of Loads on Each Wire: Since the plank behaves like a simply supported beam with an additional support at the center, the reactions at the supports can be calculated using the formulas for a beam with three supports (one at each end and one at the center,	1908	1977.2351

I must also extend my congratulations on your recent publication, which I had the pleasure of perusing last week. The depth of thought and elegance of expression therein contained are truly commendable. It is works such as yours that elevate the standards of our literary circles and enrich the intellectual landscape of our time. Furthermore, I have heard whispers of a new assembly of scholars to be formed under the patronage of a distinguished member of the court. Such gatherings promise to further invigorate our discussions and perhaps even lead to collaborations that could bear fruit in the form of publications or theatrical productions. Should you be inclined, I would be most eager to introduce you to this circle. In closing, I reiterate my wishes for your continued health and success in all your endeavors.

"No child expecting hobby horses and velocipedes  686 at home on Christmas morning awoke more eager after greater wakefulness than Bellinger. The lake waters closed over him while he whispered, ""Merry Christmas, Bryce, "" and answered, as he emerged a new man, ""Why, thank you! Merry Christmas!"" The level, livid hue of grey at length gave place to pearly pinkness, in which the trees stood up like silhouettes of black velvet. Bellinger, the smell of coffee brewing in the boma, and the phonograph were all of civilization in the desert space. But far away at the dancing field the savages had begun to move toward his hut; like a fine line drawn on a map they stretched across the land."	As the sun rose higher, casting golden beams across the savannah, the distant figures became more distinct. Men, women, and children, adorned in vibrant colors, their bodies moving rhythmically to the beat of drums that reached Bellinger's ears even at his remote station. The air filled with the scent of roasting meat and wild herbs, a festive aroma that mingled with the crisp morning air. Bellinger sipped his coffee, the warmth of the mug seeping into his palms, contrasting starkly with the cool breeze that swept over the lake. The phonograph played a scratchy tune, an old Christmas carol that seemed strangely out of place yet entirely fitting in the solitude of the African wilderness. He couldn't help but feel a twinge of loneliness, observing the communal joy from afar. Yet, there was also a profound sense of peace that enveloped him, a feeling of being exactly where he was meant to be. The simplicity of his surroundings, the vastness of the landscape, it all reminded him why he had ventured so far from the familiar. As the procession ne	1913	2006.8776
Even the local church, as was the case with Hans Christian Andersen and the Church of St. Canute, at Odense, became to Ibsen a constant source of literary information on which he drew at will long after he left his home. As for religion, creeds or dogmas troubled Ibsen little. He considered himself conscious clear so long as he kept to the straight line of righteousness. That he had religious ideas of no mean import is made evident from a close reading of his works. In fact, man in his relation to his Maker is in reality Ibsen's basic reason for clothing his views in dramatic form. Brand and Peer Gynt,  130 without their theological portent, would, of course, stand without any significance whatever.	"Similarly, in ""Ghosts"" and ""An Enemy of the People,"" the ethical and moral dilemmas faced by the characters are deeply intertwined with their spiritual crises, reflecting Ibsen's concern with the individual's quest for authenticity in a morally ambiguous universe. His plays often expose the hypocrisy of societal norms and challenge the conventional views of morality and faith, pushing his characters to a point where they must confront their own beliefs and the consequences of their actions in the light of their ultimate existential responsibilities. This profound exploration of the human spirit and its struggles is perhaps what sets Ibsen apart as a playwright who not only entertains but also provokes his audience to reflect on deeper philosophical questions. His narratives are not merely about individual characters but are universal in scope, addressing the timeless human condition and our continuous effort to define and redefine our moral and spiritual selves in an ever-changing world."	1911	2007.7273
The Cambridge plan insures the election of men who are familiar with the special work of their department, or at least have some taste for it. The Spokane plan is more saving of candidates — for if under the Cambridge plan two good men run for the office of mayor, one of them is wasted. The city runs the risk, however, of electing a whole board of financiers, for instance, with no one of them particularly competent to fill the other positions. It leaves, moreover, a large opportunity for logrolling and swapping jobs among the commissioners. The first election under the Spokane charter, held on Tuesday, March 7th, is worth examining closely. There were, as I have said, ninety-two candidates, almost every precinct being represented. Hundreds of meetings were held all over the city. It is a peculiar virtue of the preferential system that personalities and mud slinging disappear, for no candidate who hopes for a large number of second choices can afford to alienate the followers of a rival by indiscriminate personal vituperation.	The results of this election, therefore, were keenly anticipated by many as a litmus test for the effectiveness of this system. The Spokane plan’s preferential voting allowed voters to rank candidates in order of preference, which is intended to ensure that the elected officials reflect a broader consensus. This method also tends to favor moderate candidates who can appeal to a wider range of voters, rather than those who might only have a strong but narrow base of support. In practice, the election saw a diverse group of candidates being chosen, each with expertise in different areas, thereby addressing one of the potential pitfalls of the Cambridge plan where a board might end up being too homogeneous in its expertise. The preferential system also appeared to reduce negative campaigning, as predicted. Candidates focused more on promoting their own policies and qualifications rather than attacking their opponents, leading to a more substantive and less divisive election process. The Spokane election not only demonstrated the practical workings of the preferential voting system but also highlighted its potential to foster a more collaborative and less confrontational political environment. This has implications for other cities considering electoral reforms, suggesting that	1911	1990.4845

"But, and here comes the significant point, these words, when stripped of their endings, cease to have even a semblance of meaning, in other words, the endings are not merely agglutinated on to fully formed words, but form firm word units with the stems to which they are attached; the absolute or rather subjective form homo, ""man, "" is quite distinct from the stem homin which we have obtained by analysis. Moreover, it should be noted that the ending -6 is not mechanically associated with the concept of subjectivity of the first person singular, as is evidenced by such forms as vidi ""I saw"" and videam ""I may see""; in the ending es of homines the lack of the mechanical association I have spoken of is even more pronounced, for not only are there in Latin many other noun endings which perform the same function, but the ending does not even express a single concept, but, as we have seen, a combined one."	This suggests a highly synthetic nature in the formation of Latin words where endings are integral, not merely appended as an afterthought. The endings carry grammatical significance that is inseparable from the stems to which they are attached, creating variations in meaning and function that are essential to the structure of the language itself. This morphological characteristic is a defining feature of inflectional languages, where the relationship between the morpheme and its linguistic function is tightly bound. In contrast to isolating languages, where words typically remain fixed and unchanging, the inflectional nature of Latin allows for a richness and flexibility in expression. Each word can convey a multitude of grammatical nuances, including tense, mood, voice, number, and case, all of which are signaled by changes in the word's ending. This system allows for a compactness of expression that can encapsulate complex ideas within a single word, reflecting a linguistic economy where much is communicated with little. The implications of such a system are profound, affecting not only the way thoughts are structured but also how they are processed cognitively. The Latin speaker must	1911	2007.3176
Description. Some plants will reach a height of four feet and spread five feet on the ground, while others attain only half that size. The fruit resembles the cultivated cherry, but varies considerably in form, size and colour on different plants. It is generally of a reddish almost black colour when ripe. Fig. 125. Sand Cherry. Foliage and fruit. The ripe fruit varies from the size of a large green pea to five eighths of an inch or more in diameter. In some, the pit is small, while in others it is very large. The quality is generally too astringent to be relished uncooked, but this quality varies greatly in the different plants.	The skin of the fruit is typically thin and delicate, easily bruised, which contributes to its quick perishability once picked. The flesh, however, is juicy and sweet with a complex flavor that hints at both tartness and a deep, almost wine-like richness. This makes the sand cherry highly valued for culinary uses, particularly in the making of preserves, pies, and jellies where its unique flavor can be fully appreciated. The leaves of the sand cherry plant are small and oval-shaped, with a glossy, dark green surface that turns to vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The plant itself is hardy and resistant to drought, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes that experience a wide range of weather conditions. Moreover, the sand cherry is also appreciated for its early spring blossoms, which are profuse and white, attracting many pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These blossoms add a decorative element to the plant, making it not only useful for its fruit but also as an attractive addition to any garden setting.	1914	1999.5614
"In another connexion we have had occasion to briefly review the history of the words foot and feet. We saw that there was a time when these words had respectively the form sot and foti. The final t' vowel of the second word coloured, by a process of assimilation which is generally referred to as ""umlaut, "" the 6 of the first syllable and made it o, later unrounded to e; the final  i, after being dulled to an e, finally dropped off altogether. The form foti thus step by step developed into the later fit, which is the normal Anglo-Saxon form. Note the result. In foti and other words of its type the plural is expressed by a distinct suffix i, in fit, as in modern English feet, and in words of corresponding form it is expressed by an internal change of vowel."	This phenomenon, known as vowel mutation or i-umlaut, is a common grammatical feature in the Germanic languages, including Old English. It illustrates a morphological process where the characteristics of the plural form are indicated not by the addition of an external element (such as a suffix), but rather by an alteration within the word itself. This internal modification not only simplifies the word structure but also enriches the language by allowing a variety of expressive forms. The historical development of these forms from Old English to Modern English showcases the dynamic nature of linguistic evolution. As languages adapt to cultural and communicative needs, they often streamline complex inflections. In the case of the English language, this streamlining has led to a significant reduction in the use of inflectional endings, with internal vowel changes serving as markers for grammatical distinctions such as number. This shift from synthetic to more analytic forms is a key feature of the grammatical simplification seen in the history of English. Moreover, the study of such changes provides insight into the interconnectedness of phonological and morphological developments. The impact of phon	1911	2005.8846
"Furthermore, business enterprises are sometimes forced to. seek new locations where the necessary privileges can be procured. This of course is a loss to the places from which the industries move. Thus have hundreds of cities and towns suffered. These evils arising from the unearned increment going to the individual have already assumed gigantic proportions and are rapidly growing. The national welfare is threatened; for let these evils continue to grow as they have been doing during the last half century, and they will lead to an oppressive and tyrannical feudalism of wealth, and a government ""of the people, by the people and for the people"" will be a thing of the past."	It is imperative, therefore, that measures be taken to curb this growing disparity and redistribute the benefits of this unearned increment more equitably among all members of society. One proposed solution is the imposition of a land value tax, which targets the increase in land value due to societal developments rather than individual effort. Such a tax would not only discourage speculative land holding but also ensure that the benefits derived from communal efforts are returned to the community. Moreover, the reinvestment of revenues from this tax into public infrastructure and services could further stimulate equitable growth and development. By enhancing public transportation, education, and health services, the government can uplift the general welfare, making opportunities more accessible to everyone, irrespective of their economic status. The challenge lies not only in the implementation of these policies but also in shifting public perception to recognize that true prosperity comes from a well-balanced society where wealth is not concentrated in the hands of a few. Only through such reforms can we hope to maintain the democratic ethos of our nation and avoid the pitfalls of a divided society governed by the affluent.	1911	1986.092
Wing shapes. — A number of studies of wing shapes was made at the National Physical Laboratory, and the best of these was selected for a new series of full scale experiments. An increase of the section of the rear spar which was desired by the designing department, solely for purposes of strength, led to a further alteration of the wing profile, thus evolving the section RAF, which proved on testing in the wind channel, to be an improvement on any of the previous models. The best position of the wing spar on this model was again studied and found by full scale experiment. On this improved wing shape, experiments are being made simultaneously in the wind channel and on the full scale, by alterations to the trailing edge and shape generally, to regulate the movement of the centre of pressure. It is thought that these experiments may lead to results of great practical value. Controls.	— The control system of the aircraft has also undergone significant modifications to enhance maneuverability and stability. The introduction of a more advanced aileron design has allowed for finer adjustments in flight, providing pilots with a smoother and more responsive control experience. Additionally, improvements in the rudder and elevator mechanisms have been implemented to ensure that the aircraft can handle a wider range of airspeeds and atmospheric conditions without sacrificing safety. The placement and integration of these controls have been meticulously optimized based on the outcomes from the wind tunnel and full-scale tests. Engineers have focused on achieving a balance between control sensitivity and ease of handling, allowing for both precise movements in tactical operations and comfortable, less strenuous controls during extended flights. Moreover, the feedback from test pilots has been instrumental in refining the control systems. Their insights from real-world flying conditions have highlighted areas where adjustments were necessary, leading to several iterative changes to both the hardware and software components of the control systems. Looking forward, the team is exploring the incorporation of electronic flight control systems, or fly-by-wire technology, to further enhance the aircraft's performance and safety features	1912	2005.2698
"These suffering souls, made so by a vicious practice of medicine, can point an accusing finger at that school which asks for restrictive medical legislation. Those who clamour for restrictive legislation have persistently refused to investigate the safer and better means of cure which have been held before them for a hundred years, simply because such means were developed outside the circumscribed limitations of the dominant school. Only recently the so-called ""Council of Pharmacy, "" created by the  632 American Medical Association, condemned as absolutely worthless, remedies which have been used with the utmost success by thousands of physicians of all schools; have stood the test of time after being subjected to the severest investigation, and have been uniformly endorsed by these physicians."	This refusal to acknowledge the efficacy of these treatments not only undermines the potential for a more inclusive and comprehensive medical practice but also perpetuates a monopoly on healthcare by a single school of thought, which may not always serve the best interest of the public. It is crucial to recognize that medicine, in its truest form, should be about healing and providing the best care possible, rather than conforming to rigid doctrines or commercial interests. The ongoing debates and divisions within the medical community regarding acceptable methods of treatment highlight a significant issue: the need for an open-minded approach that considers diverse perspectives and innovations in healthcare. By dismissing proven treatments simply because they originate from alternative practices, we risk stagnating medical progress and denying patients therapies that could potentially alleviate their suffering. Moreover, this situation calls for a reassessment of the criteria by which treatments are evaluated and endorsed. The existing bias towards conventional methods endorsed by powerful associations often overlooks the holistic and patient-centered approaches that characterize many alternative therapies. As medical practitioners and policymakers, there is a duty to ensure that all effective treatments, regardless of their origin, are considered and made	1911	2001.0887
Mr. Sutro is clever enough to create this atmosphere. And therein lies the sting. WILLIAM Foss. Population and the Food Supply. IT had been my intention to deal this week with the moral and hygienic aspects of family restriction; but as your last issue contains so many references to the food question, it will perhaps be better to thrash this out a little further, as the question of restriction is naturally subsidiary to that of the necessity for it.	The problem of population growth and its impact on the food supply is a pressing one, and it is not merely a matter of numbers. The distribution of food resources, the methods of cultivation, and the efficiency of food production processes all play crucial roles in determining whether the growing population can be sustainably fed. As nations develop, the pattern of food consumption changes, often leading to increased demand for meat, dairy, and other resource-intensive foods. This shift puts additional pressure on agricultural systems, which must not only produce more food but do so in ways that are increasingly resource-efficient and environmentally sensitive. Moreover, the issue of food wastage cannot be overlooked. It is estimated that a significant portion of the food produced globally is never consumed. Reducing this waste is crucial, as it not only conserves resources but also means that more food is available for consumption without the need to increase production. In addressing these challenges, technological innovations in agriculture, including improved crop varieties, precision farming techniques, and advancements in storage and transportation, can play a significant role. However, these must be complemented by policy measures that	1911	1999.9021
"We all idolised him; he is accustomed to live in the house. As a lamb, he used to sleep on my mother's bed; as a sheep, on the hearth rug in her room. I don't know how he escaped, but I found him being driven to a slaughterhouse and I bought him. Surely you will allow me to keep him here for one night until I am able to send him home?' ""Of course, my dear sir, my words did not actually run so smoothly as that. They were interrupted by Mrs. Summers's spasmodic efforts to have what she called her 'say.' Its torrent broke loose at last, with the upshot that I might keep the sheep for that one night only. On the morrow it, or it and I, would have to go. """	The next morning dawned bright and clear, and with it came the inevitable decision that I must part with my woolly companion. Mrs. Summers was firm in her resolution, and no amount of pleading could sway her. My heart was heavy as I prepared for the departure, the sheep bleating softly as if sensing the sadness in the air. I arranged for a local farmer, a kind-hearted man who understood the bond between a man and his animal, to take him in until I could figure out a more permanent solution. As I led my sheep to the cart that would carry him to the farm, I felt a pang of loss, but also a glimmer of hope that this was not a final goodbye but a temporary arrangement. The ride to the farmer’s place was quiet, the countryside rolling gently by as I contemplated the unexpected turn my life had taken. Upon arrival, the farmer greeted us warmly, assuring me that my sheep would be well cared for.

The two influences combined produced the opera of The Fairies and that of The Tempest. The first drove Garrick to regularise A Winter's Tale and The Shrew and to expurgate Hamlet. It is 1 Johnson. here that the actor's panegyrists, by pleading the taste of the day, can find for his sacrilegious doings the best excuse; but even here, it should be added, Garrick was a reactionary.	In an age where the neoclassical strictures of unity and propriety were gradually being challenged by the burgeoning Romantic movement, Garrick's adaptations were seen by some as a step backward, an adherence to outdated norms that stifled the true spirit of Shakespeare's works. Yet, it must be acknowledged that Garrick also played a pivotal role in reviving interest in Shakespeare at a time when his plays were at risk of falling into obscurity. His theatrical innovations, while conservative in some aspects, brought a new vitality to the stage, making Shakespeare accessible and engaging for a broader audience. Garrick's influence extended beyond mere adaptation. He was instrumental in changing the very manner in which Shakespeare was acted, emphasizing a more naturalistic style of performance over the declamatory approach that had been prevalent. This shift not only affected interpretations of Shakespeare but also altered the trajectory of English theatre. Despite these contributions, the question of fidelity to the original texts remained contentious. The liberties Garrick took with Shakespeare's plots and language, often excising what he deemed indecorous or rearranging scenes to suit	1912	2003.6896

So that at least, in dying, I may have that to remember — if you will not heed my prayers."" She takes the infant Orestes in her arms: "" Brother! — you are but a tiny helper — and yet — come, weep with me! — come, pray our father not to slay your sister. Look, father, how — silently — he implores you!"	"See how his little hands reach out towards you, how his innocent eyes plead for my life. Can you resist such a plea, so pure and so helpless? He knows not the weight of his gesture, yet it bears the force of nature's own appeal.""  Tears streamed down her cheeks as she clung tighter to the infant, her voice breaking with the weight of her sorrow. ""Father, if not for me, then spare me for the sake of this little one. Would you have him grow up shadowed by the memory of a sister slain by her own father's hand? Would you darken his days with a deed that will echo through our halls forever?""

She lowered her eyes, her voice a whisper, ""We are your blood, father, bound by ties that even the gods dare not break. Do not sever what nature has joined so sacredly."" She awaited his response, her fate, and that of her young brother, hanging precariously in the balance, dictated"	1913	1913.7045
"Marney, "" said Punts, fiercely, "" put Cam and Mart to bed some place in your old rattletrap hotel. Good night, kids!"" Outside gorgeous day was coming, hurling night back into the black hole beyond the western horizon, but we could hear glasses clinking in Jan Havland's. "" No noise, "" grated Punts, harshly, as he stuck his head in at the door. "" No noise, damn ye !"""	The room fell into a tense silence, the previous chatter and laughter dwindling into nothing more than the occasional scrape of a chair or the soft clink of a dropped spoon. Everyone’s attention was momentarily caught by Punts’ formidable presence, his stern face seeming to draw the shadows of the room towards him like a cloak. As he withdrew his head, the door swung shut with a muted thud, and for a brief moment, the patrons remained motionless, as if still under the weight of his command. Gradually, the quiet murmur of conversations began to resume, albeit in hushed tones, cautious not to attract further ire. The flickering light from the oil lamps cast wavering shadows across the wooden tables, where drinks were now sipped more quietly, and movements were careful and restrained.  Marney, meanwhile, had ushered Cam and Mart through the back corridors of the hotel, his steps quick and sure despite the dim lighting. The hotel, with its creaking floorboards and the musty smell of old wood, felt almost alive, echoing with the quiet lives	1913	1937.209
In ^  both fish and cuttlefish the explanation of these body organs is probably the same. In the depths of the sea colours are practically indistinguishable. The dim light of the stationary photogenic forms there would be insufficient to differentiate colours. But in the more than semidarkness of these depths, a creature with a row of luminous dots along its sides would show up like an electric sign in a dark street. The arrangement of the light giving spots could very easily be followed, even for considerable distances through the water. It is probable, therefore, that these rows of photogenic organs on the bodies of these creatures serve the purpose of plumage and pigmentation on land, a welcome for friend and a warning for foe.	Furthermore, the distribution and intensity of these bioluminescent spots may play a crucial role in communication and mating rituals, as well as in the deterrence of predators. The patterns created by the lights could signal specific messages, much like the unique songs of birds or the intricate dances of bees. In the vast and often featureless deep-sea environment, where other senses such as sound and smell are also altered, light communication offers a distinct advantage. The evolution of such bioluminescent capabilities suggests a fascinating adaptation to the challenges of deep-sea life. The ability to produce light not only aids in basic survival functions but also enhances the possibility of species propagation by attracting mates from afar through specific luminescent displays. This form of communication is especially vital in the immense darkness of the deep sea, where finding a mate can be a rare opportunity. Moreover, the strategic use of light can help in creating illusions and misleading potential predators, much like some land animals use camouflage. By adjusting the brightness and pattern of their lights, deep-sea creatures can create confusing signals that might mimic other, perhaps more	1911	2003.3323
It is stated that in a machine on the ground a wire has been tightened up to a tension of 7,000 kg. per sq. cm., although its breaking stress was 10,000 kg. per sq. cm. The apparatus consists of a longitudinal sounding box; on the top of the box are two transverse knife edges, one movable along the box ; these aie pressed against the wire by springs at the two ends of the box. The wire between the knife edges gives out a note,   353 when vibrating, which is intensified by the sounding box; and in making a measurement this note is varied by moving the adjustable knife edge until it agrees with that given by a tuning fork. Under these conditions, for a given note, it is shown that l = K^r where L is the length of wire vibrating; t is the tension per unit section; and K in a constant. The instrument can thus be graduated to read the tension direct. The variation of the constant with the thickness of the wire is discussed. For wires from 1*6 to 4 mm.	in diameter, it was found that the constant K changes only slightly, suggesting that for practical purposes, it can be considered nearly invariant within this range. This finding simplifies the calibration of the instrument for different wires, as long as they fall within the specified diameter range. Further experiments are recommended to verify if this trend holds for wires thinner or thicker than this range, which could expand the utility of the device. The precision of the tension measurement also depends on the stability of the knife edges and the accuracy of the tuning fork used as the reference note. It is crucial that the knife edges are manufactured to high tolerances and are kept sharp to minimize any damping effects they might have on the wire's vibration. Additionally, the quality of the tuning fork must be maintained, ensuring it is free from rust or any form of deformation that could alter its pitch. Future developments could include digital readouts that interpret the frequency of the wire's vibration electronically, potentially increasing the accuracy and ease of reading the tension. This would also allow for real-time monitoring of wire tension in various industrial applications, providing immediate feedback and alert	1912	1975.6515

While wheat has been and is the most prolific crop of this empire country, there were, in 1907, only 358,000 of the 1,050,000 acres of deeded land planted to wheat. The last few years have shown a marvellous increase in dairy farms and small fruit farms, and while wheat growers have grown comfortably rich in large numbers, their ranks ere long are going to be made seemingly small by the much larger number of wealthy farmers who have gained their competencies from the dairy and small fruit farm. The reason for the slow development hitherto of the latter class of farms is not far to seek. Without a market, dairy produce and fruit are of little value. With a market, approximately close, and adequate facilities for transportation, they become profitable in increasing degree.	This shift towards diversified farming is further accentuated by the rising costs associated with wheat cultivation, including labor, land, and equipment, alongside the inherent risks posed by weather and global market fluctuations. Meanwhile, dairy and fruit farming offer a more stable income due to the consistent demand for these products. Moreover, technological advancements in refrigeration and transportation have made it feasible to maintain the quality of dairy and fruit products over longer distances, thereby expanding potential markets. The government and various agricultural organizations have also played a significant role in this transition by providing subsidies for irrigation and offering training programs on best practices for dairy and fruit cultivation. These initiatives have reduced the entry barriers for new farmers and encouraged existing wheat growers to diversify their crop production. As a consequence, regions that were once vast expanses of wheat are now mosaic landscapes of orchards, vineyards, and dairy farms. This diversification not only strengthens the economic stability of the farming sector but also enhances the ecological health of the area by promoting biodiversity and reducing the reliance on single-crop cultivation, which can deplete soil nutrients and increase susceptibility to pests and diseases	1911	2005.813
Alterations have been made in all these items step by step, the necessary model experiments being indicated to the N.P.L. at the various stages, and the results, when received, used as a basis of calculation. It has been possible thereby to proceed economically by keeping the full scale work a minimum. Having thus narrowed the field, each item was verified on the full scale to be certain that no unexpected or dangerous feature was introduced. In comparing the new RAF. graphs with last'year's, it is to be noted that the engine was changed from a 60 to 70 HP., and that this and other changes increased the weight of the aeroplane from 1.530 lbs. to 1,650 lbs. The first corrected RAF. graph is therefore given in Fig. 1.	The adjustments in engine power and overall weight have had a noticeable impact on the aerodynamic performance, as evidenced by the RAF. graphs. These alterations were essential to accommodate the increased payload and to enhance the aerodynamic efficiency, crucial for maintaining optimal flight characteristics. Further changes included modifications to the wing design and tail configuration, which were also tested through model experiments to ensure that the changes contributed positively to the aircraft's stability and maneuverability. The data collected from these experiments was meticulously analyzed, allowing for refinements in the design before full-scale implementation. This iterative process helps in identifying potential issues early in the development phase, thus mitigating risks associated with direct full-scale modifications. Moreover, the shift from a 60 HP to a 70 HP engine required adjustments to the fuel system and power distribution mechanisms to ensure that the increased power did not compromise the aircraft's operational efficiencies. These changes were also reflected in the updated RAF. graphs, showing improved thrust-to-weight ratios and enhanced performance curves at various altitudes. Overall, the systematic approach of using model experiments combined with full-scale verifications has proven effective in integrating	1912	2005.1696
Note tur lex experiences en plain vol, effeclufoa mir un bi/iliin M. Farman (Bulletin de l'lnstitut A£rotechnique de l'Universite' de Paris, Fascicule III., 1913). — Results of measurements made on a Farman machine in flight. The particulars of the machine given are, briefly : — Wing surface, 49'2 m: tail surface, 11'8 i'; total lifting surface CI m'. (The front elevator is here not included, the angle of incidence being sensibly zero in normal flight.) Net weight 598 kg. The axis of the screw being placed horizontal, the mean angle of incidence of the wings was found to be 5°; of the tail, 3°30' ; of the front elevator, 1°20'. Three recording instruments were employed to register respectively the relative wind speed, the inclination and the altitude. The speed recorder was provided with an antenna comprising a Venturi and a Pitot tube.	The inclination was measured using a gyroscopic clinometer, which provided accurate readings even under the turbulent conditions often encountered during flight. The altitude was recorded with a barometric altimeter, calibrated to provide precise measurements to ensure reliable data collection. During the flights, the Farman machine consistently demonstrated stability and control, likely due to the well-calculated angles of incidence and the effective distribution of the lifting surfaces. The experiments conducted yielded valuable insights into the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft. It was observed that the angle of incidence of the wings played a crucial role in maintaining lift while minimizing drag, a balance crucial for efficient flight. The tail's angle helped stabilize the aircraft, particularly during maneuvers and changes in speed, while the slight angle of the front elevator facilitated subtle adjustments in pitch. These findings were corroborated by the data from the recording instruments, which showed a consistent pattern in the behavior of the aircraft relative to changes in these angles. The speed measurements indicated that the aircraft could maintain a steady velocity with minimal fluctuations, which is indicative of good aerodynamic design. Overall, the study conducted on the Farman	1912	1985.6145
The centre of mass is now in the axis of rotation. A check on the accuracy of the centering is obtained by rotating the upper part of the balance through the range of angles at which experiments are to be made. Cross wires. — For the purpose of fixing a definite position cross wires are attached one to each beam and one to the balance support in its .immediate neighbourhood. The two cross wires cannot be very close together, as allowance has to bo made for angular movement of the balance arms. To avoid parallax a mirror is attached to the balance arm and a definite position of the eye is secured in the usual way by obtaining coincidence between the cross wire attached to the support and its image in the mirror fixed to the beam.	This method ensures that the observer's line of sight is directly perpendicular to the plane of the mirror, thus eliminating any error that might be caused by viewing from an angle. Furthermore, by aligning the cross wire with its reflection, the exact center of rotation is confirmed, and the balance can be adjusted accordingly if any discrepancies are noted. To enhance precision, the balance is typically mounted on a stable platform, isolated from any vibrations or external disturbances that could affect its equilibrium. The sensitivity of the balance is such that even minute forces can cause significant deviations, making meticulous setup and calibration crucial. In addition to these mechanical alignments, it is also vital to control environmental factors such as temperature and air currents, as these can affect the measurements. The laboratory room is often temperature-controlled, and the apparatus might be enclosed in a glass case to prevent air movements from influencing the balance. Once all these factors are carefully managed, the balance is ready for conducting precise measurements of torque, force, or mass, depending on the specific requirements of the experiment. This setup is critical in fields such as physics and engineering, where accurate	1912	1981.2579
Lines running in the frontal surface marked 2000, 4000 and 6000 are altitudes in feet. The point D is 6000 feet above the surface C. Usually the slope of a frontal surface is expressed in terms of the depth DC in feet per distance EC in miles. The depth DC can be stated in miles if desired. Examples of frontal slopes are: 1 mile depth per 200 miles extension on the surface, ie., 1 per 200 miles; 5000 feet depth per 300 miles surface  extension, ie., 5000 feet per 300 miles; \/2 mile depth per 80 miles surface extension, ie., i per 80. In the lower sketch of Figure 86, the symbols are used to show how the front appears on the surface weather map. The line AB corresponds to the same line AB in the upper sketch. A warm front is designated by a 6000 0 4000 2000 WARM AIR * COLD AIR MOVEMENT H C Hgurc 87.	The symbol for a cold front, on the other hand, is depicted by a line with triangular points directed towards the direction of movement, indicating the intrusion of colder air into a warmer air mass. These symbols help meteorologists and the public understand the dynamics at play in the atmosphere and predict weather changes accordingly. In practical application, understanding these frontal slopes and their representation is crucial for aviation, agriculture, and general weather forecasting. Pilots, for instance, must be aware of the altitude and slope of weather fronts for safe navigation and to anticipate potential weather-related challenges during flight. Similarly, farmers rely on accurate weather forecasts to make informed decisions about planting, irrigation, and harvesting based on expected weather patterns. The interaction between different air masses at these frontal boundaries often results in precipitation, as the warmer, moist air is forced upwards by the denser, cold air, leading to condensation and cloud formation. This is why regions along frontal boundaries frequently experience rain or storms. Understanding the slope and extension of these fronts allows meteorologists to predict not only when and where these weather events might occur but also their intensity and	1913	2000.0619
This leads to the limiting case in which one of the stabilising coefficients vanishes, and to the exceptional case in which they both change sign The limitation is, in fact, relative and amounts in substance to an increase of the resistance coefficients. (iii.) By reduction of the coefficients of disturbance, which in the limit become zero or even change sign. This method leads to the most elegant solutions of the problem of stability; but from the constructional point of view involves some technical complications. This method, like the last, amounts also essentially to an increase of the resistance coefficients. (iv.)	By intentional alteration of the system's dynamic parameters to modify its natural frequencies and damping characteristics. This approach often focuses on adjusting the mass distribution and stiffness properties of the system, thereby shifting the natural frequencies away from the range of operational frequencies that may induce resonance or instability. Such alterations can be achieved through changes in the physical structure or by adding components such as tuned mass dampers. (v.) By employing active control strategies that dynamically adjust to changing conditions to maintain stability. These strategies use sensors to monitor system performance and actuators to make real-time adjustments based on the data received. Active control can compensate for disturbances and potentially unstable dynamics, offering a flexible solution to stability problems. However, it requires complex control systems and continuous energy input, making it generally more expensive and technically demanding than passive methods. Each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice between them depends on specific application requirements, including the nature of the instability, the operational environment, and cost constraints.	1912	2002.5188
"In 1717 was founded a paper devoted 1 Lettret sur le Anglais et let Franfois, Geneva, 1725; written in 1694-5. ' Le Guide d'Angleterre, Amsterdam, 1744 ; written in 1712-14.  entirely to English literature: La Biblioth&que angloise; ou, histoire littdraire de la Grande Bretagne; and in the same year Le Journal littdraire, published at La Haye, gave a lengthy and well informed dissertation on English poetry, in which an adequate place was at length assigned to Shakespeare. Let us see how he was treated The writer first lays down the principle that where the classical unities are not observed ""a tragedy is not a tragedy At that rate we can 1 Journal litteraire, 1717, tome ix. pp. 157-216. We add a r6 sume of the first part of this important article: The two nations which can claim the foremost rank in the sciences and the arts are the English and the French. A comparison between the French and the English spirit; the English more licentious than the French. The English language the richer of the two."	The English, possessing a greater freedom in their literary productions, often diverge from strict Aristotelian precepts, favoring instead a more naturalistic representation of human emotions and situations. This divergence is most apparent in the works of Shakespeare, whose dramas, though not conforming strictly to the classical unities of action, time, and place, achieve a profound psychological depth and realism that the French tragedians, bound as they are by classical constraints, often do not.  Shakespeare's characters are not merely vehicles for advancing a plot within the confines of a single setting and a compressed time frame; they are fully realized human beings, whose internal conflicts and transformations reflect broader human truths. This depth of characterization and the dynamic unfolding of action across various locales and over more extended periods allow for a more comprehensive exploration of themes such as ambition, love, betrayal, and redemption. The critique in the Journal littéraire goes on to commend the richness of the English language, which, with its vast vocabulary and flexibility, lends itself well to the nuances and complexities of Shakespeare’s dialogue. The writer argues that this	1912	1923.7639
The venom trickled down from it. Sigurn, Loki's wife, sat by and held a basin under the venom; and when the basin was full, carried the poison out. Meanwhile the venom dropped on Loki, who shrank from it so violently that the whole earth trembled. This causes what are now called earthquakes The carving on the cross appears to correspond with this story exactly, showing Loki bound, with a serpent above, and his wife holding out the cup to catch the venom. 'Cf. Beowulf 1698; Teuton. Myth. 1. 312-314.	Further examination reveals the rich detail and craftsmanship that went into the depiction. The serpent, coiled menacingly above Loki, is rendered with scales that have a palpable texture, almost writhing in their artful execution. Sigurn, meanwhile, is portrayed with a solemn expression, her duty grim yet necessary, capturing the tragic stoicism of her role in Loki's punishment. The artistry of the cross not only communicates the myth but also the emotional resonance of the scene. The interplay of despair and duty, the eternal struggle and suffering, are all captured in the lines and forms of the carving. This serves as a poignant reminder of the themes of fate and retribution that are prevalent in Norse mythology. Such artifacts are invaluable, not only as religious symbols but also as cultural documents. They offer insights into the spiritual and mythological landscape of the past, preserving tales that might otherwise have been lost to time. The cross with its depiction of Loki's torment stands as a testament to the enduring power of these ancient stories, resonant with the fears, values, and beliefs of the Norse people	1904	1985.8604

"The first view may be represented in the words of the historian of the Roman wall: ""The Romans were not only great conquerors but they were wise and politic governors. They brought all the nations of the then known world into unity, and spread the blessings of order and civilisation to the very ends of the earth. The people of England are in this respect the successors of the Romans. Through their instrumentality vast continents, of the existence of which Caesar never dreamed, have obtained the advantage of a well organised government; their rude inhabitants have been induced to engage in the pursuits of peaceful industry; and the blessings of Christianity have been pressed upon their attention."" % There is here no hint of a suspicion that the Roman rule was otherwise than wholesome for the people of ancient Britain, Gaul, Greece or Egypt."	The second view, however, presents a more critical perspective on Roman governance, highlighting the often harsh and exploitative aspects of their rule. Critics argue that while the Romans did introduce roads, aqueducts, and urban planning, these were primarily designed to enhance the efficiency of military control and economic exploitation. The local populations were subjected to heavy taxation, and many were enslaved or enlisted to serve in the Roman legions. Cultural assimilation often meant the suppression of indigenous traditions and languages in favor of Roman customs and Latin language. Furthermore, while Rome brought certain technological and administrative advances, it also imposed a rigid class system and often brutal legal practices. The peace maintained by the empire, celebrated as the Pax Romana, was frequently a peace enforced through suppression of dissent and brutal retribution against those who resisted Roman rule. Thus, the legacy of Roman governance is seen by some as a complex interplay of enlightenment and tyranny, progress and oppression. It is clear that the benefits were accompanied by significant costs, particularly to those at the lower end of the social hierarchy and those on the periphery of the empire who	1908	1988.8699
. The absurd theory that commerce could be left to take care of itself was exploded by the naval operations of the war. The North Atlantic had continued so dangerous all through September that British shipping practically disappeared from it, and neutral shipping was greatly hampered. All the Atlantic ports of the United States and the South American seaboard were full of British steamers, mainly of the tramp class, that had been laid up because it was too dangerous to send them to sea. The movement of supplies to England was carried on by only the very fastest vessels, and these, as they ran the blockade runners' risks, demanded the blockade runners' compensating profits.	The government, recognizing the dire necessity of maintaining a steady flow of goods and resources, initiated a series of convoys. These convoys were heavily guarded by naval escorts, consisting of destroyers and other warships, which provided a protective shield against enemy submarines and surface raiders lurking in the vast ocean expanses. The situation necessitated a reevaluation of prior laissez-faire attitudes towards commerce in wartime. It became evident that without governmental intervention and the organization of maritime logistics, the lifelines of trade and resource supply would be severed, leading to disastrous consequences for the war effort and the national economy. Moreover, the strategic importance of shipping routes highlighted the need for more advanced naval technology and tactics. Developments such as improved anti-submarine warfare techniques, the use of aircraft for reconnaissance and protection, and enhanced communication systems between ships and their escorts were rapidly accelerated. This shift not only changed the nature of naval warfare but also transformed the relationship between government and industry. Public-private partnerships were forged, as shipyards and manufacturers were enlisted under national directives to prioritize war materials and vessels over commercial products.  	1906	1942.4648
The most famous system of continuation schools, the discussion of which has had most valuable influence on the whole German situation, is that of the city of Munich, where the indefatigable superintendent of schools, Dr. Kerschensteiner, has succeeded in a perfect adjustment of educational needs to the practical requirements of the community. Particularly his industrial continuation schools have been organised in such a way that almost every important business is represented by special classes for apprentices and special classes for journeymen and older working men. There are classes for chimney sweepers and for cabinetmakers, for coachmen and for ivory carvers, for watchmakers and for photographers, for tailors and for locksmiths, for barbers and for gardeners, for office boys and for waiters. There are altogether two hundred and ninety-six classes for the first years and one hundred and thirteen classes for those who are beyond the years of apprenticeship.	This comprehensive program ensures that every trade is catered to with a curriculum tailored specifically to the skills and knowledge required in that field. Moreover, Dr. Kerschensteiner’s system doesn’t merely focus on the technical training but also incorporates civic education into the curriculum, thereby fostering a sense of community and responsibility among the students. This dual focus on practical and civic education is what makes the Munich model particularly innovative and effective. Classes are held in the evenings or on weekends to accommodate the work schedules of the apprentices and journeymen, ensuring that education does not disrupt their practical work experience but rather complements it. The courses are designed not only to enhance the students' skills in their specific trades but also to broaden their general knowledge, improve their problem-solving abilities, and prepare them for advancements in their careers. Furthermore, the continuation schools in Munich encourage a collaborative environment where students from various trades can interact, exchange ideas, and learn from each other's experiences. This interaction also helps in building a well-rounded perspective on different industries, which is invaluable in an increasingly interconnected world. Dr. Kers	1911	2004.6866
"The objection to the use of '' Tubolite "" has, up till recently, been the current required, owing to it having been necessary to make the lamps with carbon filaments. This trouble has now been surmounted, and metal filament lamps are available consuming only 1-5 watts per candlepower. I am able to show you two photos of windows illuminated with "" Tubolite, "" one being a furniture shop (Fig. 15) and the second (Fig. 16) a window display of prints in a picture shop."	The effect achieved by this new lighting is most striking. In the case of the furniture shop, the warm glow of the Tubolite lamps enhances the natural hues of the wood, making the textures stand out with a richness that is quite appealing. The grains and finishes of various pieces—from mahogany desks to oak bookcases—appear more pronounced and inviting under this illumination. It not only attracts the attention of passersby but also creates an ambiance that is both welcoming and sophisticated. Turning to the picture shop, the Tubolite lamps reveal their ability to display prints with great clarity and vividness. The colors in the artwork pop, and the details are crisply defined. This is particularly important for art displays, as accurate color rendition and shadow detail can significantly influence a viewer's perception and appreciation of the pieces. The Tubolite's consistent light spread ensures that each print is evenly lit, avoiding the common pitfall of uneven lighting that can create glare or leave parts of an image in shadow. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of these metal filament lamps makes them an excellent choice for businesses looking to reduce	1912	1976.7986
At the crop season, when everything is sold and the loans from the bank, the acceptances, and all other debts paid, the balance is struck and the surplus divided. Forty percent, of the net earnings goes to the members in lieu of wages; twenty percent, usually goes into the reserve fund; twenty percent, is used for improvements; and twenty goes to insurance, taxes, and education. It is said that at present the net profit to each man for his labour on the farm is one hundred and fifty dollars, which he usually supplements by working on free days on neighbouring estates for the ready cash thus obtained. The women earn proportionately less.	The children, too, contribute their share, albeit smaller, by assisting with lighter tasks suited to their strength, such as gathering eggs, feeding smaller livestock, and helping during harvest time. This communal effort not only bolsters the economic stability of the cooperative but also instills a strong work ethic and sense of community among its younger members. Education of the children is not overlooked. Part of the funds allocated for education ensures that children receive at least basic education, which is crucial for their personal development and the future prosperity of the cooperative. Classes on agriculture, basic literacy, and numeracy are provided, with occasional seminars on more advanced agricultural techniques for the older children, ensuring a new generation well-versed in both traditional and modern farming methods. The cooperative also places emphasis on sustainability. The reserve fund, often bolstered by the cooperative's prudent financial practices, is sometimes used to invest in sustainable farming equipment or to implement eco-friendly farming practices, such as crop rotation and organic farming, which not only improve yield but also ensure that the land remains fertile and productive for future generations. In this way, the cooperative	1913	1996.9553
The only change in q is due to addition or subtraction of water in the parcel, whereas changes in absolute humidity occur for each change of altitude and moisture content. 25 Even though specific humidity is constant for many physical processes in the atmosphere, while other humidity measurements are not, it is not commonly used. Relative humidity ranks first in popularity, and the temperature dewpoint combination second. Figure 14. Mixing of air.

"The reason for the preference for relative humidity over specific humidity in common meteorological practice is largely due to its direct relationship to human perception and comfort. Relative humidity gives a sense of how ""humid"" it feels outside, which is of more practical use to the general public. Additionally, it is crucial in various weather-related calculations and forecasts, influencing everything from precipitation probabilities to heat index values. On the other hand, the dewpoint temperature provides a more absolute measure of atmospheric moisture content. It indicates the temperature to which air must be cooled to reach saturation (assuming air pressure and moisture content are constant), which is a critical factor in fog formation and dew formation. This measure is particularly useful in agricultural meteorology and aviation, where knowing the potential for dew or frost can affect planning and operations. Despite the practical benefits of specific humidity in theoretical and applied meteorological research, such as in studies of air parcel movements and energy transfers in the atmosphere, its usage remains limited in everyday weather reporting. This is mainly because specific humidity does not directly relate to the conditions humans experience, making it less relevant for daily weather"	1913	1999.5773
"And the strange thing is that, though our ideal of future character is so often hidden from us, overlooked, forgotten, it is always there, and always potently, though unconsciously, shaping our course in life. ""Every one, "" says Cervantes, ""is the son of his own works."" But his works do not come out of the air, by chance. They are wrought out in a secret, instinctive harmony with a conception of character which we inwardly acknowledge as possible and likely for us. When we choose between two lines of conduct, between a mean action and a noble one, we choose also between two persons, both bearing our name, the one representing what is best in us, the other embody [43]  ing what is worst. When we vacillate and alternate between them, we veer, as the man in Robert Louis Stevenson's story veered, between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. We say that we ""make up our minds"" to do a certain thing or not to do it, to resist a certain temptation or to yield to it."	But what we are really doing is deciding which version of ourselves we wish to cultivate and bring to the forefront. It is a continuous, internal struggle between aspirations and impulses, between what we desire to become and what we are tempted to remain. This inner conflict is not merely a battle of decisions, but a profound dialogue with our potential selves. Each choice we make is a brick in the edifice of our character. Over time, these choices accumulate, constructing the individuals we present to the world. Thus, our actions are not isolated incidents; they are expressions of a deeper narrative of self-identity. This narrative is not fixed but fluid, constantly rewritten with every decision we face. It is influenced by our environment, our experiences, and our reflections upon them, yet it remains guided by that hidden ideal we hold of who we can be. In this way, our lives are less about finding ourselves and more about creating ourselves. We sculpt our character through the clay of our choices, each one an opportunity to affirm or alter who we are. The nobility of our actions, then, is not derived	1908	2002.4916

After the people of Arizona had overwhelmingly voted to adopt the proposed constitution; after the Democratic House and Republican Senate had by enormous majorities voted to accept the constitution, Mr.  552 Taft remained as the only hope of the enemies of popular sovereignty, and his veto message, while displaying the ingenuity of the trained sophist, was as insulting to the American electorate as his alleged reasons for his action are unwarranted by the facts of history as they relate to the temper of the people. This act should prove sufficient to make every friend of a pure and free judiciary and of a government ""of the people, by the people and for the people, "" resolutely determine to exercise his utmost influence to defeat Mr. Taft for any future elective office."	The crux of the issue, as outlined in President Taft's veto message, was the provision in the Arizona Constitution that allowed for the recall of judges. This, according to Taft, threatened the independence and impartiality of the judiciary—an essential cornerstone of American democracy. His argument was that the judiciary must remain free from the whims of shifting public opinion to effectively uphold the rule of law. However, proponents of the Arizona Constitution saw the recall provision as a necessary check on judicial power, ensuring that judges remained accountable to the electorate. The conflict highlighted a fundamental debate about the balance of power in a democratic society: the need for judicial independence versus the demand for judicial accountability. Critics of Taft's veto argued that it was an overreach of executive power, interfering with a state's right to self-governance and reflecting a paternalistic attitude towards the voters of Arizona. They contended that the people of Arizona had the right to establish their own governmental structure, including provisions for judicial recall, especially since they had expressed their overwhelming support for the constitution through a democratic vote. The backlash against Taft	1911	2002.3419
"How trim everything was! — how solid and prosperous! The great cattle shed, on the one hand; the sheep station on the other, with pens and hurdles — the fine stone built laboratory — the fields stretching to the distance. She turned to the room in which 'she stood. Nothing trim or solid there! A foundation, indeed, of simple things, the chairs and tables of a bachelor's room, over which a tawdry taste had gone rioting. Draperies of "" art "" muslin; photographs in profusion — of ladies in very low dresses and affected poses, with names and affectionate messages written across the corners; a multitude of dingy knickknacks; above the mantelpiece a large coloured photograph of Mrs."	Dolby herself, draped in an elaborate gown, looking down with a forced smile that seemed to strive for allure but captured only weariness. The contrast between the orderly exterior and this cluttered, somewhat desperate attempt at decoration struck her with a poignant clarity. It was as if the room were trying to assert an identity it could never comfortably own, to mirror an aspiration that was forever out of reach. She sighed and moved towards the window, pushing aside a heavy velvet curtain that did little to keep out the draft. Outside, the estate sprawled with a kind of effortless dignity, its lands neatly partitioned like the squares of a chessboard, each piece playing its part in the grand strategy of agricultural success. Here, in this room, the strategy was less clear, the roles confused, a mishmash of personal longing and poor taste. She picked up one of the photographs from a crowded side table, tracing the inked inscription with a fingertip. The looping handwriting was as flamboyant as the pose, the message attempting intimacy but feeling like a shout across a vast and impersonal	1913	1999.1208
"And such things continue to happen. CONSERVATION NEWS By M. F. Abbott ""American Conservation"" THE first number of American Conservation appeared in February, 1911, and was a notable addition to the literature on this subject. The second number is as notable and among the many good things a bibliography on ""Waters and Water Power, "" compiled by Philip E. Wells, should certainly be read by every conservationist. Other bibliographies are promised from time to time. This one is complete on the subject with which it deals and will be invaluable to everyone who wishes to understand what has been written on the subject. Fighting Forest Fires In American Forestry for April there is a notable article on ""Some New Ideas in Controlling Forest Fires."""	The piece, authored by forestry expert John H. Wallace, delves into innovative strategies that are being developed to combat the ever-present threat of wildfires. Wallace highlights the importance of predictive analytics and advanced surveillance technologies, including satellites and drones, which can detect nascent fires before they spread extensively. He also discusses the role of controlled burns in maintaining the health of forest ecosystems and mitigating the severity of fires. Wallace argues for a more integrated approach to fire management, emphasizing collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies as well as private landowners. This cooperation, he asserts, is crucial for sharing resources and information swiftly and effectively, which can dramatically improve response times and outcomes. Furthermore, the article explores the potential of new materials and construction techniques that can make infrastructure more resistant to fires, thereby safeguarding human lives and properties. Wallace calls for increased public awareness and education on fire safety practices, suggesting that community involvement is key to enhancing the resilience of fire-prone areas. Overall, Wallace's article serves as a comprehensive overview of the current trends and future directions in forest fire management, offering valuable insights	1911	2007.6282
These are comparatively small compared with European practice, but there is every reason to suppose that in the near future this form of lighting will play a more important part. One other paper on gas lighting, by MB. R. F. PIERCE, deserves mention. Particulars are given of the deterioration in the light from gas lighting units, owing to failing of the mantle and the deposit of dust on glassware, c., were given. The rates of deterioration from different sources at the end of 1,000 hours, taking the average, were found to be as follows: Mantle alone, 2-5 percent. ; burner alone, 10 percent: total, 15 percent.	This decline in efficiency must be taken into account in the maintenance and operation of gas lighting systems. Mr. Pierce emphasized the importance of regular maintenance to replace worn mantles and clean glass fixtures to ensure optimal light output. He also suggested that improvements in mantle material and design could significantly reduce the rate of deterioration, thus enhancing the longevity and performance of gas lighting units. In the discussion that followed Mr. Pierce's presentation, several experts highlighted the potential for integrating newer technologies with traditional gas lighting to create hybrid systems. These systems could leverage the aesthetic appeal of gas lighting while benefiting from the efficiency and control offered by electric lighting solutions. The idea of using photoelectric sensors to control the intensity of gas lights depending on natural light availability was also proposed, indicating a move towards smarter lighting solutions in urban and suburban settings. Overall, the session concluded with a consensus on the need for further research and development in the field of gas lighting to adapt to contemporary demands while preserving its unique characteristics. The potential for gas lighting to remain a viable and preferred option in certain applications was acknowledged, with advancements in technology expected to play a key	1912	2003.091

Combs, it was held that even partial performance under a contract can sometimes lead to recovery, particularly under the doctrine of substantial performance. This principle allows a contractor who has performed enough of the contract to claim payment for the value of the work done, minus any damages caused by non-completion. Further, in Forsler v. Green, the court examined the issue of recovery for services when the term of service had not been completed due to breach or abandonment. The decision emphasized the importance of determining whether the breach was justified based on the terms of the contract and the behavior of the parties involved. The court ultimately ruled that if the abandonment by the employee was without just cause, the employer might not be liable to pay for services rendered up to the point of abandonment. In Averill v. United States, the claimant sought compensation for services rendered under a government contract that was prematurely terminated. The Court of Claims found that the termination was lawful under the contract terms, which included a termination for convenience clause. This case highlights the importance	1913	1965.1101

"be produced. This was out of 49 outstanding gusts which were measured. In two further gusts the rise appeared to have hsen almost sudden with overruns of 2'0 mph.. Nineteen gusts gave overruns of 1*5 or ro mph., while the remainder (25 gusts) gave either 0'5 or 0-0. The individual days did not all give the same degree of overrun. Thus on November 26th, 1912, the mean overrun from 12 outstanding gusts was 1""0 mph. : on December 11th, 1912, from 9 gusts, 0-8 mph. ; on December 13th from 15 gusts, 0°9 mph. ; and on January 31st, 1913, from 13 gusts, 0-2 mph. It was obvious from inspection of the trace that the gusts on  the last named day were of a very much more rounded character than those on the preceding days."	The rounded nature of the gusts on January 31st indicated a slower buildup and decline in wind speed, which could suggest a more stable atmospheric condition or a different wind pattern on that day compared to others. The sharper, more abrupt gusts recorded on the earlier dates were indicative of more turbulent atmospheric conditions, possibly influenced by frontal systems or other meteorological disturbances passing through the area.  Further analysis of atmospheric data from those days might reveal deeper insights into the causes of these variations. For instance, examining the presence of high and low-pressure systems, temperature gradients, and other relevant weather phenomena could help explain the differing characteristics of the gusts. Moreover, correlating these wind events with any reported impacts, such as damage to structures or effects on transportation, could provide practical insights into the significance of these measurements. In conclusion, the variability in wind gust overrun observed across different days underscores the complex and dynamic nature of atmospheric behavior. Such data are crucial not only for understanding weather patterns but also for improving forecasting models and developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of wind-related events on communities.	1912	1992.0675
explained.'' Mr. Ritchie had not, of course, explained them, because he had left such considerations out altogether, and had gone, as far as he could see, for the actinic method of testing, ie., he had relied on the degree to which the reflected light from the various colours affected the chemical value of the plates that he was using ; but he thought that a certain amount of colour discrimination was necessary, and this method rather lacked that discrimination by artificial light. This was unfortunate, as artificial light had become part of our everyday life. Even now.	as we sit discussing these scientific matters, the room is aglow with the soft radiance of electric bulbs, each casting shadows and hues that natural light never would. Mr. Ritchie's method, while precise in its own domain, fails to capture the full spectrum of human experience with color under varied lighting conditions. It is this very interplay of light and color that gives the world its depth and vibrancy, and which any method of color analysis must account for if it is to be truly comprehensive. Therefore, while the actinic method serves well in the laboratory, it falls short in practical applications where colors are not viewed in isolation but as part of a larger, often artificially lit, tableau. What we need, perhaps, is a hybrid approach that combines the rigorous quantification of the actinic method with a more nuanced understanding of how colors are perceived under different lighting conditions. This would not only enhance the accuracy of color measurement but also its applicability to real-world settings, where the subtleties of color and light play such a crucial role in our perception and understanding of the world around us	1912	1943.5149
The sacred aspect of authority, in the pre military society has been touched upon; 4 the same feature appears in the authority of the post military king. Not only is it natural to explain his prestige as general and ruler in terms of mana, but other 1. Livingstone, op. tit., 618. This association of freeborn children with the king is not uncommon. Cf. the King of Benin's retinue of boys. The canoes of the Nigerian kings are rowed by boys. The Bororo chief's ceremonial singing is accompanied by a chorus of children. Why do the Westminster School boys acclaim the king a the Coronation ? and what are the Children of the Chapel Eoyal ? 2. Burrows, JAI., NS. 1 : 40, 41, 42. 3.	Moreover, the sacredness attributed to the king extends beyond his role as a military leader or an administrative figure. It seeps into the very fabric of the society, influencing cultural traditions, religious rituals, and even daily interactions with the populace. This divinity or sacrosanct nature often manifests itself in various symbolic rites and ceremonies that underscore the king's unique connection with the divine or supernatural realms. For instance, in many societies, the king is seen as the mediator between the gods and the people, a role that might involve leading religious ceremonies, making sacrifices, or even interpreting omens and dreams. Such practices reinforce the notion of the king not just as a political leader but as a pivotal spiritual figure whose authority is derived from a higher, mystical source. This intertwining of the temporal and the divine in the king's authority can be observed in numerous historical and anthropological examples. In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh was considered a god on earth, directly responsible for the fertility of the land and the well-being of his people. In medieval Europe, the divine right of kings posited that monarch	1908	1993.4349
"Alice Bell, though recovering from the broken leg, develops tuberculosis of the knee, and Dr. Earl and Miss Holland strive by improving her general health and getting her out into the open to so build up her constitution as to enable her to overcome the evil condition. Finally Dr. Earl is called to Magnolia, Massachusetts, to attend a patient. He promises to send Alice ""something better than candy from Boston."" A few days later Sylvia takes the little girl to her country home for a week end. After Alice has left, a package of candied fruit comes from Boston, addressed to her and bearing Dr. Earl's initials. Mrs. Bell opens the box and eats one piece."	Upon tasting the candied fruit, Mrs. Bell finds it delicious and decides to save the rest for Alice's return, knowing how much her daughter would enjoy the thoughtful gift from Dr. Earl. She carefully reseals the box, placing it on the top shelf in the pantry, away from prying eyes. Meanwhile, in the countryside, Alice is thriving under the gentle care of Sylvia. The fresh air, the warmth of the sun, and the joy of being in nature seem to be working wonders on her health. Each day, she grows stronger, her cheeks flush with a newfound vitality. Sylvia, seeing the improvement in Alice's condition, decides to extend her stay for a few more days, hoping that the continued exposure to the wholesome environment would further benefit her recovery. Back in Magnolia, Dr. Earl receives word of Alice's progress and feels a surge of satisfaction. His efforts, combined with Sylvia's kindness, are paying off, and he begins to hope that Alice might fully recover from her ailment without the need for more drastic medical interventions.

"— Gerhardt C. Mars. ""SCIENCE AND HEALTH"": THE TEXTBOOK OF CHRISTIAN SCIENCE By B. O."	"Flower. This book delves deeply into the principles of Christian Science, a religious movement founded by Mary Baker Eddy in the late 19th century. It explores the nature of reality, the role of God in individual health, and the power of the mind in overcoming physical ailments. The work is structured to elucidate key concepts such as the all-encompassing goodness of God, the unreality of material conditions, and the ultimate reality of the spiritual universe. In ""Science and Health,"" Flower aims to provide readers with practical guidance on how to apply Christian Science teachings to daily life, emphasizing the importance of prayer and the study of the Scriptures. The book discusses the scientific underpinnings of Christian Science healing, challenging conventional medical practices and advocating for a spiritual approach to health and wellness.

Of these compounds of fatty acids occurring in nature the commonest are esters of the triatomic alcohol glycerol. These are fats when they are solid at the ordinary temperature and oils when they are liquid. Such esters may contain one, two or three fatty acid radicals, the mono, dior triglycerides as they are respectively called; for instance the esters formed by butyric acid with glycerol are: — I. the a and $ monobutyrins — (C Jd CH, .OOC.C, H, och. OH ICH..OH CH2.OH IH CH,. OOC. C, H, OH Of these the a form must clearly be capable of occurring in two stereoisomeric optically active modifications : — I  THE FATS 2. the aft and the aa dibutyrin — (CH,. OOC. C, H, CH. OOC. CHAND oa CH, .OH CH..OOC.C.H, OH OOC.	C4H7) and 3. the tributyrin — (CH2.OOC.C4H7 CH.OOC.C4H7 CH2.OOC.C4H7). Each of these structures represents a different level of saturation of the glycerol molecule with fatty acid radicals, affecting both their physical properties and their biological roles. The fats, being non-polar, are insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents such as ether and chloroform. This characteristic makes them crucial in the biological realm for storing energy, insulating and protecting organs, and forming cell membranes. In the digestive process, these triglycerides are broken down by enzymes such as lipases, which hydrolyze the ester bonds, releasing the fatty acids and glycerol for use in energy production and other metabolic processes. This breakdown is essential for the absorption and utilization of fats from the diet. Moreover, the degree of saturation of the fatty acids in these esters influences their melting point, with saturated fats generally being solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fats are typically liquid.	1913	2005.9434
The King seems to have understood something of the kind, and so far as his helplessness under the constitution availed, he interfered to save the fair petitioners from the virtuous ferocity of the bystanders. That was a good advertisement for the principle of monarchy which, in these days, is by no means wanting in just and kind kings to endear it to the people. George the Fifth is apparently a king whom any of the earlier Georges might well have patterned by in this, if not in other things, and the contemporaneous mob of half drunken and wholly savage republican sovereigns who, under the patronage of the local police, insulted and hustled a peaceable suffrage parade in Washington might profit by the King's example, and another time recognise the right of petition.	It is a fundamental right, as old as the Magna Carta itself, and one that should be respected regardless of the cause being advocated. The incident in Washington serves as a stark reminder of the sometimes tenuous nature of civil liberties, even in a nation that prides itself on its democratic values. The contrast between the King's intervention to protect the petitioners and the conduct of the so-called sovereigns in Washington highlights a profound disparity in understanding and respecting the principles of peaceful protest and petition. This divergence also underscores the importance of leadership in upholding the dignity and rights of individuals, particularly those advocating for change or reform. Leaders, whether monarchs or elected officials, have a duty to ensure that the voices of the people can be heard without fear of violence or repression. The example set by George the Fifth, in showing compassion and intervention on behalf of the petitioners, should serve as a guiding principle for all who hold power.  In an era where the actions of leaders are closely scrutinized and can influence international opinion, the adherence to such fundamental principles of respect and protection for civil rights	1913	1981.715
The most common way of protecting against this insect Is by spraying the trees just after the blossoms fall, when the apples still stand upright, with Paris Green and water at the rate of one pound to one hundred and sixty gallons. When the trees are sprayed to prevent scab, the Paris Green may be added to the Bordeaux mixture at the rate of one pound to one hundred and fifty gallons of the mixture. Plum and Apple Curculio. These are snout beetles which cut  , small holes in the fruit as  they feed, and also use the fruit as a place for laying their eggs. The latter soon hatch into a small grub which, at maturity, is about one half inch long. The special injury to the fruit from this insect comes from the hard knots that form where it has been stung, which makes the apple gnarled and of poor quality. Remedies. These insects  breed most ^ in the wild plums, haws and wild crab  apples, and destroying these generally results in lessening the damage to the apples in their vicinity.	Moreover, thorough cultivation around the trees helps to destroy the larvae that fall to the ground to pupate. Such cultivation should be done early in the season before the beetles begin their activity. Another effective method is the use of sticky bands around the trunks of the trees during the time the adults are active. This prevents them from climbing the trees to lay their eggs. It is also advisable to pick up and destroy any infested fruits. This practice, known as sanitation, reduces the population of the next generation of pests. In severe cases, application of an approved insecticide may be necessary. The timing of the application is crucial; it should be done just after the petals fall and before the insects begin to lay eggs. Always follow the label directions for any chemicals used to ensure safety and effectiveness.  For organic orchards, neem oil and kaolin clay sprays can offer some protection without the use of harsh chemicals. Neem oil acts as an anti-feedant and growth regulator, deterring feeding and disrupting the life cycle of the curculio. Kaolin clay, when sprayed on	1914	1976.7393
That there are defects in their education is doubtless true, but these defects could be largely overcome by earnest young men if their employers cared to encourage them to do so. In the past engineering institutions have suffered neglect, but employers are now more alive to the ad vantages of scientific training. At the present moment the difficulty is not so much that the existing institutions are faulty, although there are doubtless matters in which they could be improved; it is rather that there are not enough of them. A very brief examination of the long list of existing colleges and technical schools in Germany devoted to engineering and industry, shows the vast superiority of the conditions in that respect. They are more numerous, better equipped, and better staffed. Moreover, it is necessary to remember that the system in Germany and other Continental countries is of long standing. Most of the men actually engaged in industry, the directors, heads of departments, even the foremen, are men who have enjoyed technical education.	This contrasts sharply with the situation in Britain, where many of those in similar positions have climbed the ranks based on experience rather than formal education. The German model has proven successful in creating a workforce that is not only technically skilled but also highly innovative, capable of leading and adapting in an ever-evolving industrial landscape. It is this integration of practical skills with theoretical knowledge that provides a solid foundation for the industrial sector. In response to these observations, it is clear that British industry needs to invest more heavily in the expansion and enhancement of its educational infrastructure. This does not merely mean increasing the number of institutions but also improving the quality of education provided. This includes updating curricula to reflect current industry standards and future trends, investing in state-of-the-art equipment, and attracting top-tier educators with relevant industry experience. Furthermore, there is a need for stronger partnerships between industry and educational institutions. Such collaborations can lead to internships, apprenticeships, and co-operative education programs that provide students with valuable hands-on experience. These opportunities not only enhance learning but also help students build networks and transition more smoothly into the workforce. 	1912	1997.1031
He soon became imbued with my love of mechanical pursuits and also with my passion for astronomy and allied sciences, developing an interest in Mars equal to if not surpassing my own. His most intimate schoolfellow was John Claxton, and, as there was a very strong friendship between 35  them, we were so much together that I came to regard him almost as a second son. When my boy was in his twentieth year I noticed that a great change came over him, for instead of being cheerful and high-spirited he became very quiet and self absorbed, and there was often a faraway look in his eyes which puzzled me very much. One morning I went to call him at his usual time for rising and found him in a deep sleep from which I was unable to rouse him.	After several attempts, I became alarmed and summoned our family physician, Dr. Edwards. He examined my son thoroughly and concluded that he was suffering from a severe case of exhaustion, likely due to overwork and mental strain from his intense focus on his studies and hobbies. Dr. Edwards prescribed complete rest and a break from his usual activities, suggesting that he spend some time in the countryside to recuperate. I arranged for him to stay with my sister, who lived in a quiet village surrounded by nature. The change of environment seemed beneficial. Slowly, the color returned to his cheeks and the light to his eyes. He would take long walks in the fresh air, often accompanied by John Claxton who had come to visit. They would talk endlessly about the stars, but I noticed that my son was now more grounded, his thoughts not solely occupied with the celestial. One evening, as we sat by the fireplace, he shared with me that he had been feeling overwhelmed by the vastness of what he wanted to achieve in astronomy and mechanics. He realized during his convalescence that while his passions	1911	1955.8041
"Governor Foss of Massachusetts has a similar great opportunity in responding to the suggestion of Mayor Fitzgerald of Boston, that a resolution be passed by the Legislature appointing a commission to investigate and report in print the draught of a bill providing means for reaching ""the unearned increment"" by taxation more fully than at present. 90 Results in Great Britain Liberal newspapers are rejoicing at the now available statistics of trade for the whole year, 1910, and they attribute the fuller tide of commercial prosperity to the influence of progress toward adequate land value taxation. Taxation in Pennsylvania Newspapers are calling for the help of Boards of Trade and Chambers of Commerce to wipe out the agricultural and rural classification of much property really situated in cities. Pittsburgh and other cities seem to suffer much from the effects of taxation not according to market value of locations, but according to the use, however inadequate, to which they are put."	This practice often leads to considerable disparities in taxation burdens, as urban properties under rural classification evade a fair share of municipal taxes, thereby increasing the financial strain on fully classified urban properties and diminishing the funds available for public services. Such a situation calls for a thorough revision of the tax assessment procedures to ensure that all properties contribute equitably based on their real market values. In response to these concerns, there is a push for legislation that would require more rigorous and regular assessments, and possibly the introduction of a system that taxes based on location value, irrespective of current use. This approach, proponents argue, would not only bring fairness to the tax system but also encourage the more productive use of land, reducing speculative holding that can stifle development and contribute to housing shortages. Moreover, aligning tax policies with actual market values could lead to a more stable and predictable revenue stream for cities, allowing for better planning and implementation of public projects and services. The debate continues, with various stakeholders, including property owners, business communities, and local governments, weighing in on the potential impacts of such tax reforms.	1911	1993.7582
On the other hand, trilaurin has been isolated by distillation of laurel oil in the vacuum of kathode light •(Krafft). The glycerides of the fatty acids up to caprylic acid are liquids heavier than water. Tricaprin melts at 31° C. and the glycerides of higher saturated fatty acids are solids lighter than water. The melting points of simple glycerides of fatty acids are higher than those of the corresponding acids; those of the mixed gly cerides are considerably lower than that of the fatty acid entering into their composition which has the highest melting point (Guth).	For instance, tristearin, a glyceride of stearic acid, melts at 71.6° C., whereas stearic acid itself melts at 69.6° C. This increase in melting point illustrates the effect of esterification on the physical properties of fatty acids. Conversely, the melting points of glycerides can be manipulated by creating mixtures of different fatty acids. Such mixed glycerides exhibit melting points that are not only lower than the highest constituent fatty acid but also provide a range of consistencies and melting behaviors useful in various industrial applications, particularly in food and cosmetics. In the realm of biochemistry and molecular gastronomy, understanding these properties aids in the formulation of textures and stability of products. For example, the choice of glycerides can affect the mouthfeel of chocolates or the spreadability of margarine. The physical properties of glycerides, such as melting point and solubility, are crucial in these contexts because they influence the behavior of these substances under different temperature conditions, thus affecting their practical uses. Furthermore, the study of	1913	2005.5526
In conclusion, acknowledgment should by Mr. V. H. Mackinney, while that of the billiard room (Fig. 5) was taken by Mr. Hodgkin. In estimating the exposure reliance was, as usual, placed upon measurements with the Holo FIG. 5. — Whitehall Club: Billiard roam. Six 55 watt completed frosted tungsten lamps employed. be made of the courtesy of the Committee of the Club and of Mr. Wallis jones, and also of Mr. John Hodgkin, the Secretary, in granting facilities for these tests. The photographs shown in Figs. 1-4 were taken phane Lumeter. The results may be considered quite satisfactory, the conditions of illumination in the room itself being faithfully reproduced, and the shape of the lighting fixtures correctly preserved.	The uniformity of light distribution and the accuracy in color rendering were particularly noteworthy, achieving an ambiance that is both inviting and functional for the activities intended in each space. The lighting design, hence, not only meets the practical needs but also enhances the aesthetic appeal of the environment, contributing significantly to the overall ambiance of the club. Furthermore, the utilization of frosted tungsten lamps has proven to be effective in reducing glare and improving the visual comfort for the occupants. This choice of lighting fixtures aligns with the contemporary trends in energy efficiency and sustainability, offering a reduced energy consumption without compromising the quality of illumination. It is also appropriate to extend gratitude towards the electrical engineers and the technical team whose expertise was indispensable in the installation and calibration of the lighting systems. Their meticulous attention to detail ensured that each area of the club was lit according to the specific requirements of both function and form. This successful implementation of the lighting design not only serves the practical purposes of visibility and functionality but also plays a crucial role in shaping the atmosphere of the club, making it an exemplary model of modern lighting practices in public spaces.	1912	2006.2751
Begin when plants are about 8 inches high or when beetles first appear and spray at intervals of from 10 to 15 days till growth stops. Spray more frequently In hot, damp weather and less often in dry weather. Soak seed potatoes two hours. What to Spray With and What For. Bordeaux mixture combined with Parts Green or other poison for early blight and late blight and rot, also for flea beetles, blister beetles, and Colorado potato beetles. Make strong Bordeaux mixture, using at least one pound of copper sulphate to make 3 gallons of the mixture. To prevent potato scab, use commercial formalin (40 percent solution) 1 pint to 30 gallons of water. This is enough for twenty bushels of seed. General Treatment For Cucumbers, Squashes and Melons. When to Spray. When young plants come through the ground; repeat trequently. About 1 month after planting. Repeat at Intervals of 10 day  What to Spray With and What For. Tobacco dust for striped beetle. Spray with Bordeaux mixture for blight, flea beetles and striped beetles. General Treatment For Cabbage and Cauliflower.	When to Spray. Begin spraying when the plants are young and continue throughout the growing season, especially after heavy rains which can wash off the protective coatings. What to Spray With and What For. Use a mixture of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for controlling cabbage worms and loopers. This biological pesticide is effective and safe for beneficial insects. For aphids and other sucking insects, neem oil or insecticidal soap can be applied. To combat fungal diseases like black rot and clubroot, a copper-based fungicide or again, Bordeaux mixture, should be used. General Treatment For Tomatoes. When to Spray. Start spraying when the plants are about 6 to 8 inches tall or when the first signs of insect pests or disease appear. Continue applications through the growing season based on the pest or disease pressure and weather conditions. What to Spray With and What For. For early blight and late blight, use Bordeaux mixture or chlorothalonil. To control common pests such as tomato hornworms and whiteflies, use insecticidal soap, neem oil,	1914	2005.8535
"But as soon as the animals have once eaten the positive heliotropism disappears and does not return if they are again allowed to become hungry."" In this case it is clear that the chemical changes connected with nutrition directly or indirectly lead to a permanent diminution or disappearance of the photochemical reaction. In ants and bees the influence of substances from the sexual organs seems to be the determining factor in the production of positive heliotropism. The ant workers show no heliotropic reactions while in the males and females, at the time of sexual maturity, a distinct positive heliotropism develops, the intensity of which continues to increase. ""The phenomenon of ""steps"" (""Treppe"") upon stimulation of a muscle is ascribed, probably rightly, also to the formation of acid. The phenomenon of ""steps, "" that is, the increase of the amount of contraction with every new stimulus is, however, comparable to or identical with the increase in the rate of reactions in the experiments described here. 11 Loeb, 2."	This increase in contraction, or 'staircase phenomenon,' is thought to be due to the accumulation of certain metabolic byproducts such as lactic acid within the muscle fibers. As these substances accumulate, they enhance the muscle's ability to contract, leading to an increased response with subsequent stimulations. Similar biochemical processes may explain variations in heliotropic responses observed in different organisms under varying physiological conditions. In further exploring the heliotropic behaviors, it is also observed that environmental factors play a significant role. Light intensity, for instance, can modulate the degree of heliotropism exhibited. In higher light conditions, some species increase their positive heliotropic responses, presumably to maximize exposure to beneficial ultraviolet rays, which can aid in processes such as the synthesis of Vitamin D. Moreover, the duration of light exposure can induce changes in heliotropic behavior. Prolonged exposure can lead to a phenomenon known as 'phototaxis saturation,' where the organism no longer moves towards the light source, possibly as a protective measure against excessive light exposure, which can be harmful. These observations suggest that	1911	2007.1805
The court held that however dishonest and wrong morally it was for a debtor to evade services of process, it was not fraudulent in a legal sense, and that as it did not come within any express exception of the statute, the court could not make it one, as that would be making a law instead of administering it, the former of which is for the legislature, the latter for the courts.’ War is such a disability or condition as will prevent the statute from operating. It must alfect the parties or be of such duration and character as to close the courts. War will not only prevent the statute from taking effect, but it will interrupt the running of the statute for the term that the war existed. 116. Statute Does Not Operate against the Government. — The state nor the United States are not barred unless it is so expressly provided in the statute The business of the government being transmitted entirely through agents, who are so numerous and scattered, the utmost vigilance would not protect ' 13 Amer. & Eng. Ency. Law 737. 4 Slantey v. Schwalby (Tex. ), 19 S. W. ’ 13 Amer. & Eng. Ency.	"Law 737. 117. Statute of Limitations and Government Claims. — The principle that ""the king can do no wrong"" extends to the notion that the king is not bound by the statutes of limitation which apply to ordinary subjects. This principle is applied broadly in the United States to mean that the government is not bound by state statutes of limitation unless Congress has clearly manifested intent to subject itself to those limitations. In consequence, claims by the government are often exempt from the restrictions that would otherwise apply to similar claims between private parties. This exemption allows the government to pursue debts, taxes, and other claims indefinitely, safeguarding public resources that might otherwise be lost due to the passage of time. 118. Exceptions and Clarifications. — However, Congress may choose to subject certain government actions to specific statutes of limitations. For example, in cases involving the collection of taxes or penalties, Congress has enacted specific provisions that limit the time within which the government must act. Similarly, when the government is acting not in its sovereign capacity but as a commercial entity, it may be subject to the same limitations as"	1913	1950.6241
These are said to give very favourable results, and the Swedish railway authorities have decided to adopt the flash light for two new types of signals designed by their engineer, Mr. E. G. Windahl. The whole line between Stockholm central station and Saltskog will be so equipped. The combination of colour and flash light is claimed to facilitate discrimination between the types of signals — an important point in view of the complexity of the arrangements of many large modern railways. Gas Fires and the Elimination of Fog. Amongst the undasirablc legacies which an excessively wet summer threatens to leave us, The Lancet points out in an interesting article, is fog. Excellent progress has been made in gas heating.	This method not only provides a comfortable warmth but is also being utilized in attempts to dispel fog in certain areas. The concept, though still in its experimental phase, involves using gas burners to create upward air currents which can potentially dissipate fog. This technique, inspired by the smoke-lifting equipment used in large foundries and steel mills, has shown promising preliminary results in small-scale tests. Furthermore, the idea of integrating gas fire systems into street lamps has been proposed, where the heat generated could help reduce local fog accumulation, thereby improving visibility in critical areas such as railway crossings and intersections. While the full practical application of this technology is yet to be seen, its potential for enhancing both public safety and comfort during the colder, wetter months is undeniable. Authorities are considering pilot projects in several fog-prone regions to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of widespread implementation.	1912	2006.3727
In some branches they made notable advances, as in mathematics: but in the main their chief service was more in conserving the learning of the past than in creating new knowledge. Important schools, libraries and hospitals were established, especially at Baghdad and Cordova, but also at Damascus, Samarcand, Bokhara, Seville, Toledo, Granada and numerous other cities. In medicine the Arabians displayed great interest and proficiency,  and they produced a large number of writers and authorities on this subject. These were mainly translators, compilers and commentators of the Greek medical writings, so that their chief service to medicine was the preservation and transmission to succeeding ages of Greek medical lore; although they did make some material contributions in the differentiation of eruptive fevers and the introduction of certain drugs. The Arabians adhered quite closely to the authority of Galen. Of the large number of known Arabian medical writers three stand preeminent, Ehazes (850-932) and Avicenna (980-1037) of Baghdad, and Averroes (1126-1198) of Cordova.	"Their works, particularly those of Avicenna, whose ""The Canon of Medicine"" became a fundamental medical text in Europe for several centuries, were pivotal in shaping medieval medicine. This text not only encapsulated the entire medical knowledge of the Islamic world at the time but also incorporated substantial innovations such as the recognition of infectious diseases and the emphasis on hygiene and diet as crucial components of treatment. Moreover, the Arabians' approach to pharmacology was revolutionary. They introduced the use of alcohol as an antiseptic and solvent in the preparation of medicines, and they were among the first to use syrups and conserves, significantly enhancing the palatability and efficacy of treatments. Their meticulous methods in distillation, sublimation, and crystallization led to the production of purer and more effective compounds, which formed the basis of modern pharmacology. In the field of public health, the contributions of the Arabians were equally significant. They established the first hospitals that not only served as places for treatment but also as centers for medical education and research. These hospitals were equipped with amenities that were unprecedented at"	1911	1994.9559
If I were she, I Mould beat you. I would have satisfaction for that tittle tattle, and I would get very angry. Let us talk of my accursed affairs, since you are good enough to concern yourself with them. Never have I been so vexed and so upset. Not to be able to get from London some twenty comedies in the course of a whole year 1 I could have got them from China! I have cursed like a pagan ; at present I am waiting patiently, but Heaven alone knows with what rage. Not having enough to make a second volume, I have decided on printing the first; it will be out in two months or earlier.	The printers have assured me it will be a splendid edition, one to make the bibliophiles' hearts sing. I have taken great pains to ensure that every page reflects the excellence I desire. The typeface, the paper quality, everything has been chosen with the utmost care. But oh, the frustration of not being able to complete the second volume! It gnaws at me daily. Each delay, each mishap with the shipment, feels like a personal affront. I pace my study, I brood over my letters, and I send more urgent messages to my contacts in London. They must think me quite the tyrant by now, but I cannot help it. This work means everything to me, and to see it half-finished, thwarted by such trivial matters as transportation, is maddening beyond belief. I vow, once this is over, I shall never again depend so heavily on distant shores for my endeavors.	1912	1889.4254
"Abroad we have our opinions, hold our counsel, and go our way. For some reason — which could be defined, but I must discipline the fever I have caught over here in England — we not only feel we want to tell people what we think, but at times feel — most absurd of attitudes — that we should actually enjoy being crucified for our ideas. This sensation, which is evidently common over here to people who pride themselves on their independent detachment, that is, from the "" middle class"" standpoint (and by this I do not mean a standpoint exclusively peculiar to the  April 25, 1912 457 THE FREEWOMAN so-called "" middle classes ""), would explain the defiance of certain of our "" freer "" spirits in the face of public opinion. It would explain your own, for instance."	It is this very defiance that lends a peculiar zest to the battles fought by such individuals. They are not content to simply hold an opinion; they feel compelled to thrust it upon the world, to challenge the status quo, and to dare the consequences that such actions might invite. This is not merely a pursuit of change or progress, but a deeper, almost existential need to assert one's identity and beliefs against the broader societal norms. It is as if in this act of defiance, they find a profound sense of self-validation and purpose. In England, where tradition and conformity often hold powerful sway, the act of standing apart from the collective viewpoint can be particularly poignant. It becomes not just a personal statement, but a public spectacle, a drama in which the individual tests their convictions against the weight of societal judgment. The possibility of 'crucifixion', metaphorical though it may be, adds a dramatic intensity to the endeavor, making the stakes feel higher and the victories sweeter. This is not to say that such attitudes are without their critics or consequences. Indeed, the very nature of these actions	1911	1960.4138
from the floor. One single central fitting is responsible for the illumination of this dome, and it is necessarily of considerable dimensions. It is formed of a white bowl, ft. 6 in. in diameter, containing twenty 250 watt easily varied as required. For cleaning or renewing the lamps, the whole fixture can be lowered to the ground by means of a worm gear. For the above particulars and illustration we are indebted to the courtesy of Thr Electrical World.	The design of this fixture not only serves a practical purpose but also contributes significantly to the architectural aesthetics of the space. The choice of a white bowl helps in diffusing the light evenly, reducing glare and enhancing the softness of the light that bathes the interior. This choice is particularly important in spaces where the preservation of ambiance is crucial, such as in galleries or auditoriums where the quality of light can influence the overall experience. Moreover, the ability to adjust the intensity of the light is crucial for accommodating different events or times of day. The incorporation of a worm gear mechanism for lowering the fixture simplifies maintenance, ensuring that the dome can be lit continuously and safely, which is vital for public spaces that see significant foot traffic. The integration of such thoughtful engineering with aesthetic considerations exemplifies modern lighting design practices. It reflects a deeper understanding of the role light plays in environmental design—beyond mere functionality, it is about creating atmospheres that enhance human interaction within a space.	1912	2007.0585

"Figure 95 is a northern hemisphere grid on which average wintertime isobars are placed, with a pressure separation of .20"". The 100th longitude, which passes through the United States, is the meridian on which the grid is centred. The 30.00 isobar is so designated, but others are numbered after the decimal figures only. Besides the semi permanent low pressure areas, there is present a strong high pressure area over Siberia and Russia. A weak high pressure area prevails over North America. Both the Aleutian and Iceland low systems are most pronounced in the Winter and all but disappear in Summer."	This seasonal variation in pressure systems significantly influences the prevailing wind patterns and consequently, the weather conditions experienced across these regions. In the winter, the strong Siberian high directs cold, dry air from the east across much of Asia, contributing to severe winter conditions. Conversely, the relatively weaker high pressure over North America allows for more moist, maritime air to penetrate inland, generally resulting in milder winters compared to the Eurasian continent. The Aleutian and Iceland lows, being most pronounced during winter, act as powerful drivers of the mid-latitude cyclones. These cyclonic systems traverse the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, bringing significant precipitation and storm activity to coastal and adjacent inland areas. The strength and position of these lows are crucial for determining the storm tracks and therefore, the distribution of winter precipitation and temperature patterns across the Northern Hemisphere. As the seasons transition to summer, the weakening of these lows reduces the frequency and intensity of the storm systems, leading to more stable and drier conditions, especially in the regions that are heavily affected during the winter months. The shift in pressure systems is accompanied by a	1913	1992.059
Seventy years ago, the oldest inhabitant says the settlers numbered five hundred. Then, the story goes, an islander was cast away from a fishing boat on the New Jersey coast, and a few families, lured by is stories of the island paradise, came down to settle. After the Civil War others came, so that the population must have reached a thousand. Since then the islanders have multiplied rapidly. There are now more than three thousand, about a thousand being children of school age. This is not so surprising as it seems, for the people marry early, the girls sometimes at the age of fourteen, the men at eighteen, and they have large families. One woman is pointed to as the mother of eighteen children; another was a grandmother at thirty.	The community itself, tight-knit and insular, has developed its own customs and traditions over the decades. Fishing and crabbing are the mainstay of the local economy, with nearly every family having at least one member involved in these industries. The island's isolation has also preserved certain old-world ways of life that have disappeared elsewhere; dialects and accents peculiar to this locale can still be heard among the older generations, giving the island a distinct cultural identity. Life here is rhythmic, dictated by the tides and the seasons. The community gathers for annual festivals that mark the passing of the year, celebrations rooted in both the island's maritime heritage and the diverse origins of its settlers. The most anticipated event is the Spring Fish Fest, where families compete in fishing and cooking contests, celebrating the bounty of the sea. Education is valued, with the island boasting a single K-12 school that serves all the children. The school is the heart of the community, a place where the island's future is shaped. It's not uncommon for teachers to have taught multiple generations of the same family, reinforcing	1913	2004.1283
That there is an awakened public conscience on the subject of the dissemination of knowledge' concerning public health is shown by the facts that there is a movement on foot to take from the various government bureaus those departments which relate especially to public health and combine them in one health department, and a petition has been prepared for congress asking that it provide by its bulletins help for women in the homes similar to that which is furnished farmers by the Department of Agriculture. All these are good signs of progress, but, after all, since now and for many years to come society is going to demand that woman be the guardian of the home, that she prepare the food, that she shall be her children's closest teacher and friend, the most efficient manner of developing personality in the home will be by suitable education of the growing girl and the young woman in preparation for her life's work. Conclusions The supreme test of our home organisation according to the facts which have been stated is whether or not through its means there is an increase in vitality, mentality, morality and sociality and a decrease in the number of abnormal, unmoral, desocialized and degraded.	In addressing these concerns, educational systems must be oriented not only towards academic achievements but also towards practical knowledge and skills that enhance life quality. This includes a robust curriculum on nutrition, hygiene, child care, and domestic management. Moreover, it is imperative to introduce young women to preventive health measures, basic medical knowledge, and the importance of mental well-being. Such education should not be confined merely to formal instruction but should also be integrated into community programs and public awareness campaigns. Furthermore, the role of community centers and adult education programs becomes crucial in continuous learning and support. These institutions can serve as hubs for disseminating vital information and for fostering a community spirit that values and supports health and education. By empowering women with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage both their health and their households effectively, we can ensure that they are prepared not just as caretakers but as active promoters of health and well-being in their communities. The ongoing efforts to centralize and optimize health-related governmental functions should also focus on ensuring that these services are accessible and responsive to the needs of all citizens, particularly women in their roles within the family	1911	2002.7628

""Not yet. But — I'M afraid I must, dear. Immediately."" He explained briefly what the situation was, and how his demand that it be remedied had been met, concluding: ""And there's only one answer for me to make to that. I must resign."" ""Of course you must, Page. I wish you'd done it today."" ""But do you understand what that may mean, Marjorie? I have no other position in prospect, and good salaries are not going begging. I may have to accept a smaller one than I'M giving up, and I may even have trouble in getting any job at all for a while — perhaps for a long while."""	"Marjorie's eyes met his with a steadfastness that reassured him more than words. ""Page, it doesn't matter,"" she said firmly. ""We'll manage somehow. What matters is that you do what you believe is right. You can't compromise on something like this. Integrity is worth more than any salary, however large."" Page nodded, feeling the weight of a difficult decision somewhat lifted by her support. ""You're right, of course. It's just—well, I've been thinking about the mortgage, the car payments, the kids' school fees..."" ""We will adjust our budget,"" Marjorie interjected. ""We can cut back on some expenses, maybe even find additional ways to earn. What's important is that you're not tied to a job that forces you to go against your principles."" He took her hand, grateful for her pragmatic optimism. ""Thank you, Marjorie. I guess it's one of those times when we find out what we're really made of, isn’t it?"" ""It is,"" she agreed, squeezing his hand. """	1913	2002.3993
But we destroy our learning unless we give to our mind plenty of time for absorption instead of rushing from new to new material. Even the  140   order of the lessons in school ought to be adjusted to this condition of the brain. Trustworthiness of memory and the power of accurate reproduction depends upon many factors. Every school child knows that repetition and freshness of impression is of the greatest helpfulness. Every teacher knows that the attention of the child is important. This stands in intimate relation to the impressiveness of the material, to the vividness with which it is presented, to the temporal rhythm in which it is offered, to its clearness and its feeling tone, and, above all, to the amount of material.	The more overcrowded the curriculum, the less likely the pupil is to retain and meaningfully integrate new information. It is essential, therefore, that educators carefully curate the content of lessons to ensure that each topic can be thoroughly explored without haste. This approach not only aids memory but also encourages deeper intellectual engagement and understanding. Furthermore, the emotional context in which information is presented can significantly influence a student's ability to remember it. Material that is connected to positive emotions or that is relevant to the students' personal interests will generally be more memorable than abstract or negatively framed content. Thus, an educator's ability to make learning relatable and emotionally resonant is crucial. Moreover, the method of delivery also plays a critical role. Interactive and participatory teaching methods, such as discussions, hands-on activities, and problem-solving exercises, tend to be more effective than passive lecture-style delivery. These methods not only make learning more engaging but also facilitate better cognitive retention by involving multiple senses and thought processes. In conclusion, the efficacy of education is heavily dependent on how information is structured, presented, and connected to the learner	1909	2007.302
"The same applies to the ""human machinery."" It is of no use to expect first class results when the illumination is deficient, and the workers cannot see what they are doing; bad lighting is a frequent cause of spoilt work and accidents. It is not only a question of sufficiency of light. The method of arranging the lamps so as to secure proper distribution of light, absence of harmful shadows, and avoidance of glare is equally important. In addition there are many special problems, such as the correct appearance of coloured objects and the production of artificial daylight for colour matching, which are vital in many sections of the textile industry. At a future Congress some account of the methods now adopted with a view to getting correct colour values by artificial light would doubtless prove of considerable interest."	Furthermore, the matter of eye strain must be considered, a common complaint among workers in poor lighting conditions, leading not only to decreased productivity but also to long-term health issues. Proper lighting enhances the worker's ability to perform tasks accurately and efficiently, reducing the risk of errors that could potentially lead to serious accidents or costly waste of materials. The science of ergonomics also plays a crucial role in this context. It is not merely enough to provide sufficient lighting; the positioning of light sources and the type of lighting used must be tailored to fit the specific environment and the tasks at hand. For instance, diffused lighting might be preferable in areas where workers are dealing with highly reflective materials to avoid glare which could obscure vision and lead to mistakes. Moreover, the psychological impacts of lighting should not be underestimated. Well-lit environments can significantly improve worker morale and mental well-being, creating a more pleasant and productive workplace. Conversely, dim or harsh lighting can lead to a decrease in energy and an increase in irritability and depression, further affecting the quality of work. In light of these considerations, it is essential	1912	2006.7477
It remains for the advocates of the change to demonstrate the contrary. In my opinion, the rebound from Spanish or German does not promise so active a motion. Possibly a language of a type very different from our own might produce a greater rebound. The Japanese who is learning English may well feel it a severer training than a German would. For myself, I can but think that the study which requires the greater concentration, like Latin, is more educative than the easier study like Spanish or French.	The essential value of a classical education, particularly in Latin and Greek, lies not merely in the linguistic knowledge acquired, but in the mental discipline it imposes. The intricate syntax, the precision of expression, and the necessity of grappling with complex grammatical structures, all contribute to a rigorous intellectual exercise which sharpens the mind and strengthens the faculty of logical reasoning. This is not to say that learning modern languages lacks educational value, but rather that the cognitive challenges presented by ancient languages are uniquely beneficial. Moreover, the literature and historical texts written in these ancient tongues offer profound insights into the philosophies, societal structures, and cultural values of early civilizations, which have laid the foundations for much of Western thought. The process of translating these texts forces a deep engagement with the material, fostering a critical understanding and appreciation that goes beyond mere language acquisition. Thus, while modern languages might offer more immediate practical benefits in terms of communication in a globalized world, the intellectual rigor and cultural depth provided by studying Latin and Greek render them indispensable for a truly comprehensive education. The advocates for the preservation and continuation of classical studies in educational	1911	1978.6251
A latitudinal temperature difference and the rotation of the earth create the cells of the general circulation. Both the equatorial and polar cells are well defined, but the temperate zone cell is not. The region between the equatorial and polar cells is more  or less a shuttle ground for southbound polar air and northbound tropical air, a zone of storms, and an area of ever changing winds. At high levels, all the surface features of the general circulation disappear, and the winds become westerly at all latitudes. THE POLAR FRONT One region above all others of the general circulation is important to the temperate zone. It is the zone of impact between parcels of cold air in the polar circulation and parcels of warmer air in the Prevailing Westerlies. This zone has an average position between S0N and 60N.	It is known as the polar front. This dynamic area is characterized by a semi-permanent boundary where contrasting air masses meet. The polar front is the primary genesis for mid-latitude cyclones, which are responsible for much of the weather experienced in these regions. These cyclones form along the front where the temperature difference between the air masses is greatest, leading to instability and the development of storm systems. As these air masses collide, the warmer, less dense tropical air is forced upward by the colder, denser polar air. The rising warm air cools as it ascends, its moisture condensing to form clouds and precipitation. This process is enhanced by the earth's rotation, which imparts a spin to the developing system, intensifying the cyclone's structure and increasing its wind speeds. The position and intensity of the polar front vary with the seasons. During the winter, the front tends to move southward as cold polar air pushes deeper into the mid-latitudes. In the summer, it shifts northward as the polar regions warm relative to the equator. This seasonal migration of the polar	1913	1999.09
"""De Lara was arrested at the plaza, after making an address to his own people. He was arrested without any charge being preferred against him, as the Constitution requires. He was held in the county gaol without warrant or authority. He was detained there in violation of the law. Requests of his loved ones to see him were refused."	No legal counsel was permitted to visit him. His incarceration was a stark reminder of the fragility of civil liberties in times of political unrest. The authorities, it seemed, were determined to silence De Lara, fearing his influence and the fervor with which he spoke of reform and justice. This act of suppression, however, only served to ignite the passions of his followers and sympathizers further. The people began to gather in greater numbers, their murmurs growing into chants for justice and the release of De Lara. Candlelight vigils were held nightly outside the gaol, each flickering flame a testament to their unwavering resolve. The local press, which had initially hesitated, now took up the story with vigor, criticizing the authorities for their blatant disregard for the rule of law and the constitutional rights of the citizenry. As the days passed, the pressure mounted. Legal advocates from across the region descended upon the town, armed with writs of habeas corpus and demands for De Lara's immediate release or a lawful explanation for his detention. The case quickly escalated to the higher courts, drawing	1911	1959.893
Engineer is Liable to His Employer, when He may Not be Liable to Contractor. — A later Canadian case, after a careful review of the authorities, lays down the same law, but distinguishes between an action against the architect by a contractor and one by his employer. With the contractor there is no implied contract to exercise an ordinary degree of care and skill, while with the owner he is in the same position as any other professional or skilled person, and is responsible if he omits to perform his work with an ordinary and reasonable degree of skill and care, whether it be in the preparation of plans and specifications or in the doing of any other professional work for reward.‘ In delivering the opinion, his lordship, the justice, said: “I am prepared to rule that you cannot recover any damages from the architect for any loss you have sustained in having a poor building without fraud. r1‘he only question that you can show is that he has not done the work for which he charged; that is all.	He is not liable to you on the ground of negligence if he acted within the limits of what could reasonably be expected of someone in his professional capacity. The crux of the matter is whether he fulfilled his contractual obligations, not whether the outcome was to your personal dissatisfaction or not.”  This ruling underscores an important distinction in professional liability: the necessity to prove that the professional failed to meet the contractual standards agreed upon, rather than simply not meeting personal expectations or resulting in an undesirable outcome. It is a reminder that the mere occurrence of a defect or failure does not automatically imply negligence unless it can be demonstrated that the professional did not exercise the degree of care and skill which is ordinarily provided by competent professionals under similar circumstances. This principle protects professionals from unreasonable demands and ensures that liability is assessed based on a fair evaluation of their professional conduct and adherence to industry standards. It emphasizes the importance of clear and detailed contracts that specify the expectations and obligations of both parties, thus providing a solid basis for any claims of liability or defense against such claims.	1913	1986.0903
"In the Chucawalla and Palo Verde country we have an ideal region for the production of this early fruit, the soil, climate and topography all going to show that what can be attained at Phoenix or Yuma can be equaled or excelled in this region. It has also a great advantage in being located in Riverside county, California, which is known everywhere as the greatest orange producing county of the world. In order to secure sufficient water for the complete irrigation of the district, the Chucawalla Development Company has been organised. It has had its engineers up and down the river searching for the best sites for dams, and making reports as to the most feasible plans for using this hitherto useless ""Nile"" to the advantage of their desert lands A natural dam site lias been found some twenty miles above Needles, where tremendous power — many thousands of horse power — may be developed."	The proposed dam, once constructed, will harness the river, creating a reservoir extensive enough to provide for the irrigation needs of the entire Chucawalla and Palo Verde region. This reservoir will not only secure the water supply necessary for the flourishing of citrus groves but will also open up possibilities for further agricultural developments and the cultivation of other high-value crops which require consistent water availability. Furthermore, the hydroelectric potential of this dam promises to bring electricity to this remote area, which could spur additional economic activities beyond agriculture. The electricity generated can power homes, businesses, and possibly even attract industries to the region, thereby diversifying the local economy. The Chucawalla Development Company is currently in the process of securing the necessary permits and funding for this ambitious project. Community meetings have been held to discuss the benefits and the changes that the dam would bring to the area. Most local residents and farmers have shown strong support, excited by the prospect of reliable water and new economic opportunities. In addition to the direct benefits of water and power, the project is expected to increase property values in the region and boost tourism	1911	1982.2992

Chincoteague is counted as part of the eastern shore of Virginia, that peninsula which bounds the Chesapeake Bay. The island, which is nine miles long by perhaps a mile and a half wide, is sheltered not only by the long mainland to the west, but to the east by Assoteague, which is called an island, but which is really a slim peninsula running up through Maryland. There is scarcely any place in the country where the traditions are older; but they are not, as in the other parts of Virginia, the traditions of the aristocrats whose ancestors came early to Jamestown and who can show old tombstones, old silver of King Charles's time, and old chairs made in the reign of Queen Anne. Behind the voice and views of the average Southern aristocrats there is always the flavour of another land and other sentiments than our own.	Here on Chincoteague, the traditions are of a simpler, more self-reliant folk—watermen, farmers, and wild pony wranglers—who have carved a living from the sea and the marsh lands that buffer them from the Atlantic's whims. The heritage is not of landed gentry but of hardy survivors, those who know the ways of the fish and the patterns of the migratory birds that pause in their travels to rest in the island's sanctuaries. The people of Chincoteague, much like the wild ponies known for their annual swim from Assateague, possess a rugged, untamed spirit. This spirit is celebrated yearly in the Pony Penning, a tradition that dates back to the 17th century, drawing visitors from across the nation. It is a vivid display of community and continuity, a link to a past where survival depended on the collective effort and deep knowledge of the natural world. This connection to land and sea is deep-rooted, weaving through the generations who have lived and thrived on this sliver of land. The old	1913	1973.5023
Length 8% inches. Bellenden Ker Range, Queensland. ^ - Heteronota bynoei. Two colour patterns. Genus Heteronota. Australia, extending across the continent from West to East, but wanting in the southeast. Pupil vertical; males with pneanal pores. H. bynoei. Slender Geckoes with rather large oviform head and long cylindrical tapering tail. Body covered above with small keeled granules and large keeled tubercles. In the type light brown above, with dark transverse bands, seven on the body, and up to twelve on the tail; but the colour is often broken up, the bands becoming indistinct or lost. Length rather over 3 inches. Found under logs and stones. Distribution of the genus. O  Genus Phyttodactylus. Tropical America, Africa, and Islands of the Mediterranean, Australia. In all the Australian species the back is covered with uniform small granules. P. marmoratus. Dorsal scales not keeled; digital expansion much smaller than the eye; greyish or reddish above, variegated with dark brown. Nearly 5 inches.	P. marmoratus is often found in dry, rocky areas where it can camouflage effectively against the natural background. This species is known for its ability to adapt to various microhabitats, often seen scaling vertical rock faces in search of insects. Its diet primarily consists of small arthropods, which it hunts during the cooler parts of the day to avoid the intense heat. The reproductive behavior of P. marmoratus involves the laying of two to four eggs in a secluded, moist area under rocks or within crevices. These eggs are relatively large in proportion to the female's body size, and incubation periods can vary depending on environmental conditions, typically ranging from two to three months. Conservation efforts for P. marmoratus are currently minimal as the species has not been classified as endangered. However, habitat destruction and the pet trade pose potential threats to their populations. Monitoring and research are suggested to better understand the species' distribution and long-term viability in their natural habitats. Furthermore, P. marmoratus serves as an important indicator species for the health of their ecosystems. Their presence and	1909	2005.8297
Sometimes it is known a year and a half in advance that a certain question will be up for decision at the following election. All petitions for proposed laws must be filed four months prior to election day. Then begins the educational campaign in the newspapers, debating societies and among the statesmen assembled at the grocery store. About a month before voting day there goes forth from the Secretary of State to each voter, through the mails, the Publicity Pamphlet, in which are printed all the bills and amendments to the constitution to be voted on, together with arguments for and against each, as may be furnished by its friends or opponents, they paying the cost of paper and printing for the space taken in the pamphlet. From 1904 to 1910, inclusive, this pamphlet, printing, mailing and all, has cost the state of Oregon $47,610.61. It is the voter's textbook, and school begins in earnest.	In the weeks leading up to the election, the state becomes a hive of activity. Debates are held in town halls, schools, and even local diners, each venue echoing with the passionate voices of citizens and candidates alike. Newspapers print daily updates and editorials, dissecting each proposal with a fine-tooth comb, while civic groups distribute flyers and hold forums to educate the public on the nuances of the issues at stake. As election day draws near, the arguments become more fervent. Advocates for and against each measure canvas neighborhoods, knocking on doors, and making their case directly to the voters. Telephone campaigns and radio advertisements reach out to those in more remote areas, ensuring that every voice is heard and every perspective considered. On the eve of the election, the atmosphere is charged with anticipation. Families discuss their voting plans over dinner, friends debate the merits of the measures late into the night, and candidates make their final pleas to the electorate. The Publicity Pamphlet, now dog-eared and annotated, lies on many a kitchen table, a testament to the thoroughness of	1911	1995.5621
At the same time, I had occasion to consult in connexion with my work two publications, by different authors, concerning related, though not identical groups of aDimals. The contrasts offered by the three writers were so remarkable that numerous questions were raised in my mind, as to the motives that led to the investigations, and the principles that had governed them. So far as I can see, each paper may properly be classed as a contribution to systematic zoology and yet the three are totally unlike. In one of the published papers, the writer is wholly occupied with questions of names. He produces evidence to show that a given name is of earlier date than hitherto supposed, another is preoccupied, another was never properly defined, and still others have been erroneously used. Even though the results are disturbing, the facts brought out are interesting and the methods used are clever, but the questions arose in my mind — Is this zoology? Or is it history? Or what is it? — The other publication was utterly different. The author eschewed books entirely.	He based his work on direct observations of the animals in their natural habitats, emphasizing their behaviors, interactions, and ecological roles. His approach was holistic, aiming to understand the organisms within the broader context of their ecosystems. This contrasted sharply with the first, as he sought to uncover the dynamic processes of life rather than static nomenclatural issues. The third publication straddled these methodologies but introduced a genetic perspective, exploring the evolutionary relationships among the species studied. This researcher utilized both morphological data and genetic sequencing to draw connections and map out phylogenies, thus providing a modern synthesis that linked the historical lineage with current ecological interactions. The divergence in these approaches highlights the multifaceted nature of zoological research. Each author, driven by different scientific questions and equipped with varied tools and theoretical frameworks, contributed uniquely to the understanding of biodiversity. This variety is not just a strength of zoology but of science as a whole, reflecting its capacity to adapt and evolve methodologies to suit specific investigative needs. Thus, these works collectively underscore the richness of scientific inquiry, where different lenses and levels of analysis coalesce	1911	2007.5679
"It's a funny old place in Sixth Avenue — "" ""Sixth Avenue"" "" Don'T interrupt — where the dearest old codger in the world is just going out of the house furnishing business in a small way. It's kept getting smaller and smaller — I'Ve watched it shrink — till now it can't stand up against the big shops, and the old codger told me the other day that it was no use."" ""Poor fellow !"" ""No. He's not badly off, and he's going back up state where he came from about forty years ago, and he can live — or die — very well on what he's put by. I'Ve known him rather a good while, and we've been friends ever since we've been acquainted."" "" Go on, "" the elderly girl said. Erlcort was not stopping, but she spoke so as to close her mouth, which she was apt to let hang open in a way that she did not like; she had her intimates pledged to tell her when she was doing it, but she could not make a man promise, and she had to look after her mouth herself with Erlcort."	"""He’s got some things there that you wouldn’t believe people would buy nowadays — old gas lamps, and tables that look like they’ve survived three wars, and chairs that creak louder than a haunted house. But there’s charm in those items, real, tangible memories clinging to the wood and metal."" Erlcort chuckled, his eyes lighting up with the reflection of some inner amusement. ""He even tried to sell me a chandelier once, said it would make my bachelor pad look more dignified. Can you imagine? Me, with a chandelier?"" The elderly girl smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. ""It might improve your taste in decor, you never know."" ""Perhaps,"" Erlcort conceded, his tone light. ""But then I'd have to start throwing dinner parties and wearing ties at home."" ""That wouldn’t be the worst thing,"" she teased, tapping her finger against her chin thoughtfully. ""It might even charm a certain type of visitor."" Erlcort laughed, a genuine, hearty sound that seemed to momentarily fill the room."	1913	1999.5966
Good artificial illumination is therefore a most potent means of attracting custom. On the Continent and in the United States this system has been quite extensively used, in some cases time switches being installed which enable the lighting to be turned off automatically at a prescribed hour. But the point which we should like to emphasise specially is the recognition that in high class trade shop windows should be lighted by concealed or well screened lamps which throw their light on the objects to be viewed and not in the customer's eyes. In the West end of London one finds that this method is now very generally practised. The windows of large shops are carefully dressed with a view to presenting a pleasant picture such as is bound to attract the attention of passers by. Their effect is inevitably spoilt when bright lights are placed among the articles in the window.	The subtlety of using indirect lighting not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also highlights the quality and features of the products without causing glare or discomfort to the eyes of potential customers. This approach respects the visual comfort of the viewer while ensuring that the merchandise is seen in the most favorable light—literally and figuratively. Moreover, the use of adjustable and controllable lighting systems allows for variations in ambiance depending on the time of day or the specific nature of the displayed items. For instance, softer, warmer lights may be employed during evening hours to create a welcoming, luxurious atmosphere that draws nighttime shoppers. Conversely, brighter, cooler lights can be used during the day to reflect a fresh and energetic setting. This thoughtful application of lighting technology not only serves the practical purpose of illuminating goods but also plays a crucial role in creating an environment that can influence consumer behavior and enhance the overall shopping experience. As such, retailers who master the art of lighting are often those who enjoy increased foot traffic and, consequently, potentially higher sales volumes.	1912	2005.1356
"Much of this is shipped as hay but far more is being used as stock feed. Fine cattle and horses are raised in large numbers in the valley. The climate is neither too hot nor too cold for their health, though the winter months are sharp enough to quicken their activities and give them a vigorous robustness that is not found in animals bred where there is no ""tang"" in the winter air. The great horseman, Col.  210 Dan Burns, has a large breeding farm here, with several herds of brood mares of fine stock, and he regards it as one of the finest locations for stock raising the Pacific Coast affords. Potatoes, onions, cabbages, etc., grow both abundantly and to a large size."	The soil, rich and loamy, is particularly suited for root crops, which thrive under the attentive care of local farmers. The area is also known for its apple orchards, producing varieties that are crisp and flavorful, often sought after in markets far beyond the local area. Orchards stretch across the landscape, interspersed with fields of alfalfa and clover, creating a patchwork of green that persists well into the late autumn months. Agriculture here is not just a business but a way of life, deeply ingrained in the community. Each year, the harvest festival draws crowds from neighboring towns and cities, where farmers showcase their produce and livestock, and celebrate the bounty of the season with food, music, and dance. Local cooperatives help distribute the produce, ensuring that even small-scale farmers receive fair prices. The community's commitment to sustainable practices has also led to the adoption of organic farming techniques by many of the valley's farmers, further enhancing the quality of their crops and ensuring the health of the land for future generations.

5. Fig. 6. moment. Statical considerations of equilibrium show that in this case no additional system of forces can balance the couple and produce the equilibrium unless they result in a couple contrary to the previous one; hence there must be tangential components along AD and CB, such as to balance the moments of the forces on AB and CD whether there are in addition normal forces or not. If there is a tangential stress exerting force along AD and CB (Fig. 6), and its intensity be q', and the thickness of the block ABCD perpendicular to the figure be /, the forces on AB, B.C., CD, and DA are — ABJ.q, BC./.q', CD.I.q, and DA. /. q' respectively, and equating the moments of the two couples produced — AB . /. q X B.C. = B.C. . /.	q' X AB, we find that q must be equal to q'. This condition ensures that the tangential forces are in equilibrium, effectively cancelling each other out and maintaining the stability of the structure. The analysis can be further extended by considering the effects of varying the magnitude and direction of these tangential forces. For instance, if the forces along AD and CB were to increase while those along AB and CD remain constant, the equilibrium would be disturbed, leading to a torque that could potentially rotate the block ABCD around its center. Furthermore, if we introduce external forces acting on the block, the situation becomes more complex. The presence of these additional forces may necessitate adjustments in the intensity of the tangential stresses (q and q') to restore equilibrium. For example, if a force is applied at point A directed towards D, the stress along AD may need to increase to counteract this new force and maintain balance. This analysis is crucial in fields such as civil engineering and materials science, where understanding the balance of forces within structures is essential for ensuring their stability and integrity under various loading conditions.

This battle of Marston Moor is the true turning point of the war. It is followed by the remodelling of the Parliamentary Army. (b) The second phase then opens and ends somewhat two years after the first phase with   the capture of Oxford on the 20th of June, 1646. The capture of Oxford came at the end of a number of Parliamentary successes of which the greatest was the central victory of Naseby, exactly a year before. The fall of Oxford was but the last of a long series of efforts in which Parliament had gradually worn down the King during this second phase of two years, and had taken nearly all his garrisons and had defeated all his armies in the field.	The significance of Oxford's surrender cannot be overstated; it was essentially the Royalist capital, the last major stronghold where King Charles I had his headquarters. Its capitulation marked not only a military defeat but also a symbolic loss for the Royalist cause. The strategy employed by the Parliamentarians, which involved a combination of sieges and pitched battles, effectively isolated Royalist forces and cut off their lines of communication and supply. Following the capture of Oxford, the King was left with few options and dwindling resources. This dire situation forced Charles to seek refuge with the Scottish army at Newark, leading to his eventual handover to the Parliamentarians and his subsequent imprisonment. This series of events set the stage for the third and final phase of the war, which focused less on military engagements and more on the political negotiations and trials that ultimately led to the trial and execution of Charles I. The transformation of the Parliamentary forces, notably through the formation of the New Model Army, was a critical element in their success. This professional force, characterized by its discipline, effective command structure, and innovative tactics, was a	1912	1964.6931
The f radiation fogs lie in air whose stability is insufficient to  protect the fog from strong winds; the fog then lifts as illustrated, or it may clear entirely. Advection fogs normally lie in air whose stability is too great to be overcome by a wind until its velocity reaches partial or full gale proportions. A brisk wind usually adds to the density of the fog as well as to its extent. Precipitation fogs lift off the ground into ragged and torn scud clouds when tossed by gale and near gale winds. Usual cyclonic winds, however, are too light to do more than add to the velocity of the foggy air or create intermittent breaks in the fog. RADIATION STRATUS.	Radiation stratus forms under similar conditions to radiation fog, but typically occurs when there is a slightly stronger wind presence, preventing the formation of dense fog and instead leading to the development of a more diffuse layer of cloud. These stratus clouds generally form during the night as the earth radiates heat back into the atmosphere, cooling the air near the surface below the dew point. The layer of clouds is often shallow and can cover extensive areas, leading to overcast conditions that may persist into the morning. As the sun rises and the ground warms, these clouds usually dissipate or lift, forming a higher cloud deck known as altostratus. Advection stratus, on the other hand, forms as moist, stable air moves horizontally over cooler surfaces, such as cold ocean currents or cool landmasses. This type of stratus cloud is more persistent than radiation stratus and less affected by the diurnal heating cycle, often lingering for days unless a significant weather front moves it along. Advection stratus can also lead to drizzle or light rain if the cloud layer is sufficiently thick and the	1913	1998.505
This seemed common practice, and yet the lighting required was mainly, he should have thought, for the sides of the trucks. Where, however, they wished to inspect a time table, for instance, illumination on the horizontal plane was no good at all, and it was evident that in railway stations, besides general lighting, special lighting was required for such purposes as time tables and booking offices. MB. E. P. GROVE (Central London Railway) said that as far as his company was concerned changes were made not on account of the unsatisfactory nature of the lighting, but rather with the idea of economising in cost. Experiments commenced at the Marble Arch Station with opal shades, using 1,000 watt Tungsten lamps in 'place of the arc lamps.	These adjustments proved to be quite beneficial in terms of both lighting quality and energy consumption. The opal shades diffused the light more evenly, reducing harsh shadows and glare which were common complaints with the previous arc lamps. Additionally, the Tungsten lamps, although powerful, were more energy-efficient compared to the arcs, leading to a noticeable reduction in electricity expenses. Mr. Grove further elaborated that following the success at Marble Arch Station, similar modifications were implemented across other stations within the network. This included strategic placement of directed lighting fixtures in areas where passengers frequently required better visibility, such as ticket counters and map displays. He also mentioned ongoing trials with newer LED technology, which promised even greater efficiency and longevity. These trials were being closely monitored, and preliminary results were promising, showing potential for further cost savings and improvements in environmental sustainability. The discussion then shifted towards the integration of aesthetic considerations with functional requirements. The aim was to create a lighting environment that was not only practical but also welcoming and conducive to a positive passenger experience. This holistic approach to station lighting design was becoming a central theme in their ongoing upgrades	1912	1996.624
"Concerning the bears Morse's ""Universal Geography"" for 1812, states that eight hundred thousand hides were shipped out of the United States every year. If there is such a thing as a bear industry in this country now it is of exceedingly small importance. In 1784, from one city alone, Charleston, S. C, six hundred thousand deer hides were shipped; in 1812 the price paid for a buck was forty cents; in 1878 venison cost three and one fourth cents per pound; in 1908 it took forty cents to buy a pound of venison, just exactly what a whole buck cost in 1812. Evidently there are not as many deer as there used to be. It is natural, of course, that the wild animals of a country should decrease as the population increases, since an increase in population means that new land must be cleared, and the wild animals living in the region of increase, killed off."	This systematic reduction of wildlife populations coincides with the expansion of agricultural pursuits and the growth of cities, which encroach upon the natural habitats previously occupied by these creatures. Furthermore, the hunting of animals for sport, fur, and meat has also contributed significantly to their decline. Regulatory measures such as hunting seasons and wildlife conservation efforts have been implemented in an attempt to manage and preserve the remaining populations, but the challenges are substantial. As the country has industrialized, the value and utility of wildlife have shifted. Previously, animals like deer and bears were seen primarily as resources—sources of food and material. Today, while they still hold economic value for those in the hunting and fur industries, there is an increasing recognition of their intrinsic value as part of biodiversity and their role in the ecosystem. Conservation efforts now often focus on the ecological importance of these animals, promoting a balance that allows both human and wildlife populations to coexist sustainably. In response to these changing dynamics, wildlife management strategies have become more sophisticated, incorporating scientific research, technology, and community engagement to address the complex interplay of factors affecting wildlife populations	1911	2004.4144
"142, lwa* = 0(3) Let H and V be the vertical and horizontal thrusts at either end of the span resulting from a temperature change of t degrees (V is equal and opposite at the two ends), and let MA be the fixing couple at the supports due to the temperature change; then — M = MA + va -- H.j (4) This value of M substituted in the three equations (1), (2), and (3), gives the necessary equations to find MA, V, and H. The bending moment anywhere in the rib then follows from (4). If the rib is symmetrical about a vertical axis through the middle of the span, V is zero, and the two equations (2) and (3) reduce to one, and equation (4) becomes — M = MA h>> (S) which, being substituted in (1) and (2), gives — M ^vds b.^vds+atl=o (6)  and k*f~ hf^ds = o (7) from which MA and H may be found. The "" line of thrust"" in this case is a straight horizontal line the distance of which above AB (Fig. 188) is — MA H In the uncommon case of an unsymmetrical rib the line of thrust would be inclined to the line AB, passing at distances rand respectively from A and B when T is the thrust the components of which are H and V, and MB is the fixing moment at B, viz. MA + V ."	b - H.j (8). This introduces additional complexity as the asymmetry means that V is not zero and both H and V must be considered in the equilibrium equations. The asymmetrical behavior also leads to different values of MA and MB due to differing constraints and reactions at supports A and B. To proceed with solving for these values in an unsymmetrical structure, the equations (2) and (3) must be re-examined to account for the non-zero horizontal thrust V. These equations become: - ∫yds = V (9) - ∫xds = H (10) These equations, when combined with equation (1) and the modified equation (4), form a set of linear equations which can be solved for the unknowns MA, MB, V, and H. It is often beneficial to employ matrix methods for solving these equations, especially when dealing with complex structures or when numerical methods are required for an approximate solution. Once MA, MB, V, and H are determined, the actual bending moments at any point along the rib can be computed using the revised	1908	1999.6802
In sperm oil, for instance, unsaturated alcohols occur. Furthermore, a glycol, C26H52O2, occurs as an ester in carnauba wax, and another, CS0H62O2> cocceryl alcohol, as coccerate in cochineal. The principal esters occurring in the best known waxes are given in the following list: — M.P... Cetyl palmitate.. 5 3'50 in spermaceti. Ceryl palmitate.. 79° in poppy wax. Ceryl cerotate.. 82° in Chinese wax. Myricyl palmitate. J in bees' wax. Myricyl cerotate.. — in carnauba wax. As a general rule, these waxes, with the exception of spermaceti, have to be boiled with alcoholic potash much longer than the glyceride in order to be saponified — bees' wax, for instance, for three hours.	This is due to the high molecular weight and complex structure of the esters present in these waxes, which make them more resistant to the saponification process. In addition to the esters listed, several other components such as hydrocarbons, free alcohols, and acids also contribute to the unique characteristics of each wax. For example, bees' wax also contains a significant proportion of hydrocarbons, which accounts for up to 14% of its composition, and it is these hydrocarbons that impart the rigidity and hardness to the wax. Carnauba wax, known for its high melting point and hardness, contains a large percentage of myricyl cerotate, which contributes to its exceptional durability and glossy finish. The process of saponification of these waxes involves boiling them with a solution of alcoholic potash, which breaks down the ester bonds to form potassium salts of the fatty acids (soaps) and free alcohols. The duration and conditions of the saponification process vary depending on the specific wax and its composition. For instance, while bees'	1913	1984.9354
"To the Editor of THE FREEWOMAN. MADAM, — Mr. Arthur D. Lewis furnishes a text for a sermon on economics, "" The difference between a field anywhere in Europe and a steam engine is only a question of degree: both were made by man."" The words "" question of degree "" must refer to "" made by man."" That is, one is made by man in a greater degree than the other, for if man can make a complete field, he can make a bleak mountain or a torrid desert. But his field must be located in a region of rain and sun ; in other words, Nature must help make the field. But Nature creates also in degrees ; sun, rain, soil, availability, etc."	Thus, while Mr. Lewis’s statement carries a semblance of truth, it oversimplifies the complexities involved in the creation and manipulation of both fields and engines. The steam engine, a product of industrial ingenuity, is indeed crafted through the direct application of human knowledge and mechanical skill. Every gear and piston is a testament to man’s ability to harness materials and forces to his will. However, a field, though shaped and tended by human hands, remains a collaboration between man and nature. The fertility of the soil, the patterns of rainfall, the quality of sunlight—all these are elements over which humans have limited control. They can enhance or impair them, but not create them. Therefore, to equate the making of a field with the making of a steam engine is to ignore the fundamental role that nature plays in agriculture. It is not merely a backdrop or a stage on which human activity occurs; it is an active, dynamic participant in the process. The farmer works not just with tools and techniques, but with the living ecosystem, constantly adapting to its rhythms and requirements. In essence, the	1911	1977.8058
The rod shown in Fig. 222 connecting the clamps on the specimen to the smaller framed lever, which gives the higher multiplication, is provided at its top end with an adjustment permitting the high multiplication to be used for considerable strains, the pencil being repeatedly brought 1 See Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., 1886. ' For a full description and illustrations, see Engineering; Dec. 19, 1902. 2 F    435 back to the zero to avoid passing off the cord. The longer framed lever, which gives the lower multiplication suitable for strains beyond the elastic limit, is provided with three alternative fulcra, giving magnifications of strain suitable for different materials and gauge lengths.	The arrangement of these fulcra allows the experimenter to adapt the lever to the specific requirements of the test material, whether it be a metal with a high yield point or a softer material that deforms easily. This flexibility in the setup is crucial for obtaining accurate and meaningful results from the tensile tests. Additionally, the setup includes a finely calibrated scale attached to the lever system. This scale is critical for precise measurement and is read against a fixed pointer, which ensures the accuracy of the displacement measurements. The scale itself is marked in both metric and imperial units to accommodate various standards of measurement that might be required by different research protocols or industrial practices. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a damping system to minimize oscillations that could affect the readings. This system is particularly important when dealing with high elongations, where the momentum of the moving parts could introduce errors. The damping mechanism works by absorbing kinetic energy and slowly dissipating it, allowing for a stable and steady measurement process. To ensure uniform application of force, the specimen grips are designed to be adjustable and are lined with a high-friction	1908	2003.3912
It is really only important to compare the results round the region that is generally used in practice, ie., with a thrust * The reason why the experimental mean pitch was used in determining the percentage slip, and not the calculated pitch corresponding to no thrust, was that it was desired to plot the calculated values on the same curves as the experimental values, and the pitch is only a convenient factor in the reduction of the results, the conditions being the same in the two cases when the ratio of V to » is the same. 208 coefficient between (H5 and 0-20, and the following remarks apply only to this region. With regard to the thrust coefficient for propeller So, the calculated values are in excess of the experimental values: for propeller S( the two are practically in agreement, whereas for propellers S8 and Sis the calculated values are considerably below the experimental values. For the purpose of comparison, a table has been prepared which shows the values of the torque and efficiency, and the calculated thrust of each propeller for experimentally determined thrust coefficients of 0'15 and 0'20. Propeller. Percentage Slip. Thrust Coefficient. Torque Coefficient.	Efficiency. So 12% 0.18 0.045 65% S1 10% 0.17 0.042 68% S8 14% 0.15 0.048 62% S15 15% 0.16 0.050 60% The table illustrates the variations in performance metrics across different propellers under similar operational conditions. It is evident that propeller S1 shows the closest alignment between theoretical and experimental results, suggesting a more reliable prediction model for this particular design. Conversely, the discrepancies observed in the thrust coefficients for propellers S8 and S15 indicate potential areas for refinement in either the experimental setup or the computational models used for these propellers. Further analysis of the torque coefficient and efficiency reveals that while S1 maintains a balance between thrust production and energy consumption, propellers S8 and S15, despite their lower thrust coefficients, exhibit higher torque requirements which consequently reduce their overall efficiency. This could be indicative of design characteristics that may not be optimal for the intended operational parameters, or it could suggest the	1912	1991.6835
The large tail is employed as a third limb to the tripod when the animal is sitting up at rest, and as a counterpoise to the forepart of the body when in rapid advance, and at such time does not touch the ground. In the Kangaroo proper it is thick and muscular at the base, and gradually tapers to the extremity. It is the part most favoured in the cuisine, as, like ox tail, it makes an excellent soup. The brain is smooth, and the animals manifest no great evidences of intelligence. Still they manage their own affairs in general with success. It takes some time for them to become accustomed to fresh conditions, but they can learn by experience.	Their natural instincts are sharp and well-adapted to their environment, allowing them to navigate and survive in the rugged terrains of the Australian outback. The kangaroo's hearing is acute, and its large ears can swivel independently, enabling it to detect sounds from various directions, a crucial ability for evading predators. The eyes are positioned high on the sides of its head, giving the kangaroo a wide field of vision. Socially, kangaroos are gregarious animals and often form groups called mobs, which provide safety in numbers. These mobs are usually led by a dominant male, who has earned his position through physical prowess. The social structure within a mob allows younger and less dominant kangaroos to benefit from the leadership and experience of older members. The breeding habits of kangaroos are also quite unique, characterized by a phenomenon known as embryonic diapause, where development of the embryo can be paused until environmental conditions are favorable. This reproductive strategy ensures that the mother can maximize the survival rate of her offspring.  Overall, while kangaroos may not display the	1909	2002.3568
"In our century that honour was reserved for England. Garrick had no rival in any country, and the title which was deservedly his is still vacant In the passage from the Correspondance lit tdraire quoted above, Grimm draws attention to another of Garrick's qualities: his style and diction were natural and unaffected. This, again, struck all those who witnessed his first performances. The young actor had nothing of that measured, rhythmic declamation, of those stiff and heavy movements, of that majestic sluggishness which reduced what should have been acting to an exchange of recitatives. On the contrary, he endeavoured "" to suit the action to the word and the word to the action, "" and, following ever the counsel of Shakespeare, "" to hold the mirror up to nature."" 1 Grimm, Correspondance litte'raire, 1"" juillet, 1765. '"	His performances were infused with a vigour and a sincerity that were previously unseen on the English stage. Indeed, it was this very authenticity that so captivated his audiences and distinguished him from his contemporaries. Garrick's ability to embody the essence of his characters, to bring them to life in a manner that was both true to human nature and dramatically effective, set a new standard for theatrical performance. Moreover, Garrick's influence extended beyond his naturalistic style of acting. He was also instrumental in reforming the theatrical practices of his time. He insisted on rehearsals to ensure that performances were polished, and he fought against the prevalent custom of spectators attending rehearsals and even talking during performances, which detracted from the immersive experience of theatre. His innovations were not limited to acting and production standards alone. Garrick also had a hand in changing the types of plays that were popular on the English stage. He revived interest in Shakespearean works, which had fallen somewhat out of favor, presenting them in a way that was both accessible and respectful of the original texts. This not only solidified Shakespeare's	1912	1971.6246
It is always advisable, if it can be arranged at a reasonable cost, to provide water for such crops as strawberries and blackberries, so that it may be used when needed. In some seasons a failure of the strawberry or raspberry crop may be averted by applying water at the right time. In arid regions where crop growth depends on irrigation a careful study must be made of the needs of the crop and the soil, and the time and manner of applying water. Outside of the irrigated districts thorough cultivation of a crop is better than irrigation, unless water is absolutely needed. Cultivation should always follow irrigation where possible.

"MY DEAR GEORGE, My wife wrote to you when I was upon my sickbed, but recovering. I now write myself to free you from all fears of me, as  yours dated the 12th of July has me, of you. I have had a most violent bout of it indeed, but by care I am told my health will be y"" better for it. Our disorders are partly of y"" same kind, and though' we suffer much in our sickness (I almost gave myself up for gone) we are ye better for it afterwards. I desire no more of this purification. I had two physicians."	One was Dr. Fenton, a man of considerable repute in the town, and the other, Dr. Gregory, who is known for his methodical approach and attention to detail. Both were attentive and administered their remedies with diligence and care. I must say, their concoctions were none too pleasant to the taste, but what medicine is? They prescribed a regimen of rest, a diet that was rather bland to my usual tastes, and a series of tonics that were to invigorate my system. The days were long, George, filled with much contemplation and little activity, which for a man of action such as myself, was a trial in its own right. However, I found solace in the letters and books you sent previously; they were a great companion in those quieter moments. Elizabeth was a constant presence by my side, her care unwavering. Her strength through this ordeal has only deepened my affection and gratitude towards her. I am now able to take short walks in the garden, the fresh air seems to rejuvenate my spirits and strength with each day.	1912	1868.9707
"No nation adopting these views ever progressed or prospered ; the people were soon clamouring for the revival of their old institutions, and since then no one had ever 274   teries of golf, for which pastime their level country is well suited. I have been much amused to note that, whilst M'Allister has always expressed great admiration of the mechanical skill of the Martians, they have risen in his estimation at least 100 percent, since they have taken so enthusiastically to his national game, and he is never tired of telling us what a "" sensible "" people they are ! He has taken up their training with all his Scottish vim and thoroughness, and has insisted upon the full rigour of the game. All attempts to Martianise its various technical terms he has courteously, but firmly, suppressed ; the Martian vocabulary has, therefore, been considerably extended by the addition of the numerous fearsome technicalities which sound so strange, even to an Englishman who is not familiar with the game."	The sight of these green-skinned beings, swinging clubs with precision and walking the courses with a keen eye for the lie of the land, has become a source of great pride for M'Allister. He often boasts of their quick adaptability and eagerness to learn, qualities that have greatly facilitated their mastery of the sport.  Under his guidance, the Martians have not only learned to play golf but have also absorbed some of the culture and etiquette that accompany the game. M'Allister has been meticulous in teaching them about the spirit of the game, emphasizing sportsmanship, integrity, and the respect for tradition. This has led to an unexpected but welcome bridge between two very different cultures. Moreover, the introduction of golf has had a fascinating impact on Martian society. It has become a favoured leisure activity among the Martian elite, with tournaments and competitions regularly organized. These events are not only sporting occasions but also social gatherings, promoting unity and camaraderie among the Martian populace. M'Allister's efforts have thus turned into a cultural exchange, with humans learning as much from the Martians	1911	1969.7472
AT    THIS little book is intended as a brief and simple introduction to the study of the Psalms, in English, as poetry. There are three ways in which we may study the Bible: as a revelation, as a document, and as literature. We may study it as the divinely inspired and perfect rule of faith and conduct. This is the point of view from which it appears most precious. For this is what we need most of all: the word of God to teach us what to believe and how to live. We may study it as a collection of historical books, written under certain conditions, and reflecting, in their contents and in their language, the circumstances in which they were produced.	This is the historical or documentary perspective, which allows us to place the biblical texts in their proper context, understanding the influences and events that shaped the narratives and commands within. It gives us a deeper appreciation for the struggles, triumphs, and daily lives of the people whose stories are told or who authored the texts.  Lastly, we may study the Bible as literature, appreciating the beauty of its language, the richness of its imagery, and the depth of its themes. This approach does not necessarily concern itself with the truth claims or historical validity of the texts but instead focuses on their artistic and poetic qualities. This literary perspective can help us see the universal themes of human experience reflected in the biblical stories—themes of love, loss, hope, and redemption that resonate across cultures and epochs. Each approach offers valuable insights and can deepen our understanding and appreciation of the Bible. Whether we see it primarily as a divine guide, a historical document, or a literary masterpiece, engaging with its texts can enrich our minds and spirits. This little book, focusing on the Psalms, aims to explore the poetic	1908	2006.3253
Fig. 31 illustrates the damping effect of capillary tubing in the connexions to the Pitot and static pressure tubes, and Fig. 32 shows the period of the air movements in and out of the diaphragm chambers when the air damping is reduced as much as possible. The gauge would probably have been more nearly in the condition required by the theoretical discussion if the latter periodic oscillation had been of shorter period. This  58 could be obtained in a new gauge by reducing the volume of the diaphragm chambers. This theoretical investigation is necessary in order to justify the conclusion that X is the only gauge constant of primary importance.	Moreover, it is essential to understand that while X provides a crucial baseline for calibrations, other variables also play significant roles in the accuracy and performance of the gauge. For instance, the elasticity of the diaphragm material and the viscosity of the fluid within the chambers can notably influence the responsiveness and stability of the readings. These factors must be carefully considered and controlled during the design and manufacturing processes to ensure that the gauge operates within its optimal parameters. Continuing with the analysis, it becomes apparent that the interplay between the diaphragm's flexibility and the damping effect of the capillary tubing is critical. Adjusting the diameter and length of the capillary tubes can further refine the gauge's performance, allowing for a more precise control over the damping characteristics. Such modifications could lead to a significant reduction in the amplitude of undesirable oscillations, thereby enhancing the gauge's ability to deliver swift and accurate measurements under fluctuating pressure conditions. In conclusion, while the gauge constant X remains a pivotal factor, a comprehensive understanding of all interacting elements within the gauge system is imperative. Through meticulous design and calibration, leveraging	1912	2001.6271
The residue is crystallised from a small quantity of absolute alcohol, and the crystals, after repeating the crystallisation several times if a mixture is suspected, will give the melting point 125° C. if it be pure phytosterol acetate, II 5° C. if pure cholesterol acetate. The admixture of phytosterol is indicated by a melting point higher than this latter figure after several recrystallisations even when, according to Homer, as little as I percent of a vegetable oil is present in the original oil from which the alcohols were obtained. The facts cited above, however, suggest that there should be some doubt about the chemical individuality of phytosterol. And as a matter of fact in the phytosterol of Calabar beans Windaus showed that two substances were present, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Windaus and Hauth). Sitosterol, C27H^O + HO, was first obtained from the oil of wheat and rye. Burian prepared it by extracting the lime salts of the fatty acids with acetone, and recrystallising the extract from methyl alcohol. The crystals obtained from dilute alcohol contain one molecule of water and are plates; from aether anhydrous needles are obtained. The melting point is I37'5° C.	Stigmasterol, C29H48O, on the other hand, was initially isolated from Calabar bean oil, but has since been found in a variety of vegetable oils and fats. It is structurally similar to sitosterol but contains an additional ethylidene group which contributes to its distinct chemical properties. Stigmasterol is typically extracted using similar methods to those used for sitosterol, involving solvent extraction and subsequent crystallization. The anhydrous form typically forms long, slender needles when crystallized from ether, while recrystallization from alcohol can yield large, flat plates. The melting point of stigmasterol is slightly higher than that of sitosterol, typically around 170°C. These two sterols are often found together in natural sources and can be difficult to separate due to their similar solubility and structural characteristics. Advanced chromatographic techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), are often required to achieve a high degree of purity and to accurately quantify the proportions of each sterol in a mixture. The presence and	1913	2003.4325
On such land we generally find in the North a vigorous growth of maple, hackberry and white oak. It is perhaps the best kind of an all around fruit soil and any of our fruits will do well in it. A limestone soil, where the roots can reach the underlying lime rock or soil and which has much lime in its makeup, is especially favourable for all our fruits and comes next to or may    equal in value the loess loams. In parts of Florida the coral rock and the old shells in the sand help to make good fruit soil. Heavy clay loam may be better adapted to agriculture than to fruit raising, but if such soil is thoroughly underdrained and given a proper rotation of cover crops, manure and general cultivation, it will often be found adapted to a goodly number of fruits and especially to apples, pears, currants, gooseberries and the sweet cherries. Such a soil requires a very careful management in order to get the best results from it.	The management of heavy clay loam involves not only the aforementioned drainage and crop rotation but also frequent aeration and careful attention to pH levels. This type of soil tends to hold water and nutrients well, which can be beneficial for fruit trees that require a lot of hydration and nourishment. However, the risk of waterlogging can lead to root diseases and poor air circulation around the roots, which inhibits growth and can ultimately be detrimental to the health of the fruit plants. For optimal fruit production, it is crucial to maintain a balance. Adding organic matter such as compost or leaf mold can improve the structure of clay loam by increasing its porosity and nutrient content. This addition not only enhances the soil's drainage capacity but also aids in maintaining a neutral to slightly acidic pH, which is preferred by most fruit-bearing plants. In addition to soil management, careful selection of fruit varieties that are known to thrive in clay loam conditions can further guarantee success. Varieties that are resilient and adaptable to less than ideal drainage conditions should be prioritized. For instance, certain types of apples and pears have shown	1914	2007.3059
Three of his letters to her have been preserved, and we will give them here; the first, no doubt, represents fairly well the jocular and hurried style in which he usually answered her lengthy and more studied epistles : May th, 1766. THOTT DEAR, WILD, AGREEABLE DEVIL ! I have but a moment to tell you that I love you in spite of your cruelty and ill usage of me. I have received your letters by Mr Listen but have not yet seen him; and, indeed, what shall I say to him when I do ? You say such fine things of him, that I ought to measure swords with him, instead of doing him any Service in my power; in short, if I was to fight every man that I am jealous of upon your account I should have no time for eating and sleeping.	However, I must leave you to settle your own affairs with him, as I shall be shortly embarking on a journey that will take me away from the delights of your presence for some time. I trust that upon my return, you will have not entirely forgotten me, nor given too much of your favor to Mr. Listen or any other gallant that might cross your path.  June 15th, 1766. MY DEAREST TORMENT, The days crawl on, each longer than the last, in this dreary absence from you. I have been to the north and back, engaging in affairs of both business and discomfort. Yet, even amidst the bustling crowds and pressing concerns, it is you alone who occupies my thoughts. Each night, I imagine our next meeting, which I hope will be sooner rather than delayed by the caprices of fate. July 23rd, 1766. TO MY MOST BELOVED ADVERSARY, At last, I am on my way back to you, carrying a heart brimming with affection and a mind plagued by the shadows	1912	1866.8291
Both rabbits and mice run to and fro over the snakes without showing any signs of fear, and the latter occasionally make the snakes move out of their way by nibbling at them. Birds, again, if the snake remains quiet for a short time, will frequently perch upon its back and prune their feathers, and even try to remain on after the snake has commenced to move. Snakes will only feed in warm weather, and if it becomes cold or dull during summer, they refuse to eat until the sun resumes its sway. During the winter they hibernate, the smaller under stones usually on the higher ground, under logs, or in hollow ones, and the larger in holes made in the ground by other animals, for they do not themselves excavate burrows. The teeth are shed, new ones being rapidly produced.	The process of shedding and regrowing teeth can occur multiple times throughout a snake's life, allowing them to maintain their ability to capture and consume prey effectively. This cycle of renewal is vital to their survival, especially considering the wear and tear their teeth undergo due to their feeding habits. Snakes are ectothermic, relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. This dependence on environmental warmth explains their inactivity during colder periods and their resurgence during warmer months. The sun not only stimulates their appetite but also energizes their bodily functions, enhancing their metabolism and overall vitality. In terms of reproduction, most snakes are oviparous, laying eggs in carefully chosen locations that offer warmth and protection from predators. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, where the eggs hatch internally, and the mother gives birth to live young. This method can provide additional safety for the offspring in more volatile environments. Their sensory capabilities are also highly adapted for survival. Snakes use a combination of sight, smell, and especially their sensitivity to vibrations to track prey and navigate their surroundings. The	1909	2007.4648
It is characteristic that the chief increase has come to the universities in the large cities in which the old-fashioned student life has always played a small role. In Berlin there are 14,000 persons attending the lectures and in Munich 7,000, in Leipzig 6,000. Yet especially those universities in small towns which are famous for the beauty of landscape have had their proportionate growth. In lovely Freiburg in Baden the one thousandth student was welcomed with a celebration at the time when I came there as a young instructor. Recently they have celebrated the coming of the three thousandth student. The rapid growth of the academic communities strongly suggests the foundation of new universities.	This expansion not only reflects the increasing value placed on higher education but also the growing demand for specialized knowledge in an industrializing world. Heidelberg, with its picturesque setting and historic prestige, has similarly seen numbers swell. The university, nestled by the river, has traditionally drawn those who seek the quiet contemplation afforded by its scenic environs, yet now it buzzes with the energy of youthful ambition and scholarly endeavor. The question of establishing new universities is indeed pressing. There is a clear need to distribute the academic population more evenly, to alleviate the pressures on urban institutions and to bring educational opportunities closer to those in less populated areas. Furthermore, the creation of new universities could foster regional development, encouraging innovation and economic growth in areas that would benefit from such stimulation. Moreover, the curriculum offered needs to keep pace with the rapid changes in technology and society. The traditional emphasis on classical education is being challenged by the need for practical, applicable knowledge that equips students to deal with contemporary issues. This includes the integration of new scientific discoveries, the implications of global connectivity, and the pressing need for sustainable practices	1911	1988.1058
"evaluated: substituting for h its value (17), the form (22) reduces to the values in (16), (160), or (i). The evaluation of the quantity A' (and consequently of h) for common forms of section is dealt with in the two following articles. Equation (i63) shows that if y and / are plotted as rectangular coordinates, the result is a rectangular hyperbola (see Fig. 171). As in the case of bending of straight bars, these formulae strictly referring to ""simple"" bending may be applied as approximations to cases where the bending action is not simple, but when in addition to a bending couple there is a shearing force in the planes of the cross sections as in Arts. 133 and 136 below. 130. Various Sections. — In order to use the formulae of the previous article it is necessary to find the quantity — This is a modified value of A, the area of section which can easily be found graphically as in the next article, but which can easily be calculated for simple sections."	131. Calculation of Modified Area A'. — For common structural shapes like rectangles, circles, and I-beams, the modified area A' can be determined using basic principles of geometry and mechanics of materials. For a rectangular section, for instance, A' would be calculated by multiplying the breadth of the rectangle by the effective depth, which might be taken as the distance between the neutral axis and the outermost fiber. For a circular section, A' could be derived by considering the section's radius and employing the formula for the area of a circle, adjusted by any necessary factor that accounts for the distribution of stress across the section. 132. Graphical Determination of A'. — Alternatively, the area A' for more complex or irregular sections can be determined graphically. This involves drawing the section to scale, dividing it into a series of smaller, manageable shapes (such as triangles and rectangles), calculating the area of these shapes, and summing them up. The graphical method is particularly useful when dealing with non-standard shapes or when precision is required in the integration of stress across the section. 133.	1908	1975.4098
"Eggs are produced by most of our harmless snakes, namely: the Blind Snakes, the Freshwater Snake, Tree Snakes, both Green and Brown, and the Pythons, which latter are specially interesting from the fact that they incubate their eggs, thirty or so in number, and are the only snakes known to do so. The members of the genus Diemenia, including the deadly Brown Snake, also produce eggs, a habit common to some, perhaps all, species of the genera Rhynchelaps and Pseudelaitx. With these known exceptions, the venomous snakes (the Water Snakes and Sea Snakes included) produce their young alive, sometimes in great numbers. Thus the Tiger and Superb Snakes produce each thirty or more; half of this number appears to be the compliment of the Death Adder; while I have not known more than ten to the Black  backed Snake. The Black Snake and the black bellied Snake each bring forth twenty young ones."""	The reproductive habits of these snakes are not only fascinating but also crucial for understanding their ecological roles and managing their populations. The Copperhead, for instance, typically gives birth to live young, ranging from two to ten in a single brood. This viviparity is thought to be an adaptation to cooler climates, where incubating eggs outside the body could be detrimental due to lower temperatures.  In contrast, the non-venomous snakes like the Pythons, which lay eggs, often select sunny locations to deposit their clutches, ensuring the eggs receive enough warmth for successful incubation. The female Python goes a step further by coiling around the eggs, using muscular contractions to generate heat to maintain an optimal temperature. This diversity in reproductive strategies among snakes is indicative of their evolutionary adaptability and the variety of ecological niches they occupy. Understanding these patterns not only enriches our knowledge of natural history but also aids in conservation efforts, particularly in regions where habitat destruction threatens snake populations. As we continue to study these remarkable creatures, it becomes increasingly important to consider how environmental changes influence their reproductive	1909	2007.5247
The book, it is needless to say, is charmingly written, and he who desires plenty of thrills of the goose flesh variety cannot do better than to read these stories on some wild and stormy night when the wind is howling around the chimneys. We can guarantee that his expectations will be more than realised. Amy C. Rich. The Colonel's Story. By Mrs. Roger A. Pryor. Cloth. Pp. 387. Price $1.20 net.

The populace came forth in swarms, men and women, armed with any weapon or article upon which they could lay their hands, and all fired with the same desire. And in many instances they succeeded, be it said. Hundreds of men who came forth were armed with rifles which had been carefully secreted on the entry of the enemy into the metropolis. The greater part of those men, indeed, had fought at the barricades in North London, and had subsequently taken part in the street fighting as the enemy advanced. Some of the arms had come from the League of Defenders, smuggled into the metropolis nobody exactly knew how. All that was known was that at the various secret headquarters of the League, rifles, revolvers, and ammunition were forthcoming, the majority of them being of foreign make, and some of them of a pattern almost obsolete.	The air was thick with the cries of rallying men and women, the sharp report of firearms, and the distant booming of heavier artillery. The streets, so recently silent and oppressed under the weight of occupation, now roared to life with the fervor of resistance. The defenders moved with a desperate sort of coordination, born not of formal training but of sheer will and the shared urgency of their cause. Among the fighters, stories circulated—tales of narrow escapes and daring raids to secure these arms. Each rifle and pistol carried not just the hope of victory but the weight of sacrifice, a tangible reminder of what had already been endured. The obsolescence of some weapons mattered little in the face of such determination; even the oldest gun could still serve as an instrument of defiance. As the conflict intensified, makeshift barricades were erected. Furniture, debris, and abandoned vehicles were piled high to create fortifications. From behind these, the citizens of the metropolis unleashed their salvos, each volley a chorus of both desperation and determination. The enemy, though better equipped and trained, found themselves confounded	1906	1956.6141
The hospitals were already full of wounded from the various engagements of the past week. The London, St. Thomas's, Charing Cross, St. George's, Guy's, and Bartholomew's were overflowing; and the surgeons, with patriotic self-denial, were working day and night in an endeavour to cope with the ever arriving crowd of suffering humanity. The field hospitals away to the northward were also reported full. The exact whereabouts of the enemy was not known. They were, it seemed, everywhere. They had pratically  overrun the whole country, and the reports from the Midlands and the North showed that the majority of the principal towns had now been occupied. The latest reverses outside London, full and graphic details of which were now being published hourly by the papers, had created an immense sensation.	The atmosphere in the capital was one of grim determination mixed with an undercurrent of deep anxiety. The streets, usually bustling with the typical London throng, had taken on a quieter, more somber tone as families stayed indoors, only venturing out when absolutely necessary. Posters and flyers exhorting citizens to do their part for the war effort were plastered on every available surface, and recruitment offices saw a steady stream of young men, ready to defend their homeland. In Parliament, heated discussions were underway as government officials debated the best course of action. The Prime Minister had already addressed the nation, calling for unity and resilience in the face of the unprecedented crisis. Meanwhile, local leaders organized volunteer brigades and community support groups to aid in the war effort and to help care for those displaced by the conflict. As the situation grew more desperate, makeshift hospitals began to appear in schools, churches, and even large private homes, staffed by volunteers and retired medical personnel who had come forward to lend their skills. The Royal College of Surgeons had issued a call for more supplies and was organizing training	1906	1994.4595
When too short a time interval is used to observe either velocity or direction, the presence of a gust will alter one or both measurements and render the observation inaccurate. If the velocity is measured at its peak without a compensating lull, its value will be larger than the average. If, on the other hand, a lull is measured without its compensating peak of velocity, the wind will blow harder than indicated. A short period observation of direction can lead to an error of 20° to 30° in direction, particularly if the observation is taken during a lull or a peak of velocity. No interval smaller than a minute should be employed in observing wind velocity and direction. When extreme gusts are present a 3 minute interval is more desirable than 1 minute.	This longer interval allows for a more comprehensive sampling of the varying wind conditions, thus reducing the impact of transient gusts and lulls on the recorded data. By averaging the measurements taken over these three minutes, meteorologists can obtain a more accurate representation of the prevailing wind conditions during that period. This method helps in smoothing out the anomalies caused by sudden changes in wind speed and direction, providing a clearer picture of the weather patterns. Additionally, the use of such intervals is crucial in settings where precise wind data is necessary for operational safety and efficiency, such as in aviation and maritime navigation. Pilots and ship captains rely on accurate wind information for planning routes and ensuring the safety of their vessels and crew. In these cases, even a small error in wind observation can lead to significant navigational challenges or risks. Therefore, it is essential for weather stations and other meteorological observation points to adhere to these guidelines, especially in areas prone to sudden and severe wind changes. This practice not only enhances the reliability of weather forecasts but also supports the safety and operational procedures dependent on accurate meteorological data.	1913	1995.964
Factors of safety. — In order to be able to state the factor of safety it is necessary to know the breaking strength of the material of which the spar is made. The following values have been obtained as the results of tests on beams at the N.P.L. Material. Breaking stress. Walnut 14,800 lbs. per square inch. Ash 12,300 lbs. per square inch. Spruce 8,500 lbs. per square inch. A sample of steel tube used in aeroplane construction gave under a compressive stress of 35'5 tonnes per sq. in.	When determining the factor of safety, this breaking stress must be compared with the stress the material will actually experience under operational conditions. The factor of safety is typically calculated by dividing the breaking stress by the maximum working stress expected during use. For instance, if a wing spar made of walnut is expected to endure a maximum stress of 2,960 lbs. per square inch during flight, the factor of safety would be calculated as follows:  Breaking stress of walnut = 14,800 lbs. per square inch Maximum working stress = 2,960 lbs. per square inch Factor of Safety (FoS) = Breaking stress / Maximum working stress FoS = 14,800 / 2,960 ≈ 5 This means that the spar has a factor of safety of about 5, indicating that it can withstand up to five times the maximum expected stress before failing. This is a crucial calculation in ensuring the safety and reliability of structural components in engineering, particularly in fields such as aviation where safety is paramount.  Similarly, for other materials like ash and spruce, the	1912	1994.8242
"God has saved us, "" said one of my neighbours; and I smiled, though I did not contradict. There was for all of us one battle yet untried, and it was to reduce many, including my neighbour, to a doubting of God's providence. As we steamed out of the Gulf of Smyrna and I lay looking out at the sea from the carpenter's bench, the full moon  208 rose like a bloodred lantern out of the east; she changed to gold and then to silver. In the hold there was singing; above deck there was that pleasant contentment that comes after a long day in the sun, when every one is settling down to sleep. No one paid any attention to the tumultuous looking, jagged peaked cloud bank in the west — only now and then a sailor would ejaculate, "" There is trouble coining; now there is weather, but soon there will be no weather at all."""	As night deepened, the wind began to rise, heralding the storm that the sailors had foreseen. The singing in the hold gradually ceased, replaced by the creaking of the ship and the howling of the wind through the rigging. The waves grew larger, each crest frothing angrily in the moonlight, as if challenging the ship's right to traverse their domain. The sailors moved about with a grim determination, securing any loose gear and double-checking the rigging, their faces set against the impending tempest. The captain, a seasoned man with years of experience on the high seas, called out orders with a calm authority that belied the anxious undercurrent in his voice. He knew, as did his crew, that the next few hours would test the mettle of both ship and sailor. The passengers, sensing the change in atmosphere, huddled together, whispering prayers and exchanging uneasy glances. As the ship plowed forward, the storm unleashed its fury. Lightning forked across the sky, illuminating the towering waves that threatened to engulf the vessel. The	1913	1925.7596
Here we are close to the great and vital shortcoming of the American small college. It has not duly recognised the moral value of intellect and scholarship; it has not furnished its professors with sufficient means or stimuli for scholarship on their own behalf, nor has it insisted upon anything but the veriest mediocrity of attainment on the part of its students. Not recognising the value of  high scholarship in social service, it has not looked after the character and effectiveness of its resources from the point of view of changing social needs. No one will deny for a moment that the colleges have rendered indispensable service to the country in spite of their lack of resources and of their point of view with regard to scholarship — some indeed will say because of it.	However, the crucial issue remains that these institutions often fail to cultivate a robust intellectual environment that not only fosters academic excellence but also prepares students to engage thoughtfully and effectively with the complex realities of the modern world. This oversight can leave graduates ill-equipped to navigate or influence the broader cultural, technological, and economic landscapes. To address this, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift in how small colleges perceive and prioritize academic rigor and intellectual growth. They must strive to attract and retain faculty who are not only educators but also active contributors to their fields. Investment in scholarly research and the creation of opportunities for faculty to pursue their academic interests will enrich the educational environment, enhancing the quality and depth of instruction that students receive. Furthermore, small colleges should set higher academic standards and expectations for their students. This involves rigorous curriculum designs that challenge students and push them to the boundaries of their intellectual capabilities. Offering more specialized courses and incorporating interdisciplinary approaches can also help in broadening students' perspectives and analytical skills. In essence, the potential of the American small college to significantly impact societal progress is immense, provided there is	1911	2007.5259
Although the slaughter of animals is from the ethical point of view condemned, the domestication of animals for their service is not excluded, since it can be easily shown that domestication yields to animals security from beasts of prey, protection from the elements and provision for food beyond the natural expectations, thus tending to prolong life as well as to promote the well-being of the animals. The ethical vegetarian is not concerned with physiological opinions bearing on the healthfulness of plant as against animal albumin, just as the consistent antivivisectionist is not concerned with the question whether vivisection has resulted in knowledge that leads to the alleviation of human suffering, the cure of human disease and the prolongation of human life; even though animal flesh be the most healthful of foods, even though vivisection lead to the cure of human disease, man has no right to these at the cost of animal life. When now we turn to the modern science of nutrition, and ask the question: Is a vegetarian diet physiologically correct, adapted to the best purposes of a normal life, capable of sustaining the highest standards of growth, health, endurance and longevity?	we find a wealth of evidence supporting the idea that a well-planned vegetarian diet meets all these criteria. Numerous studies and nutritional research have shown that vegetarian diets can provide all the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for optimal health. In fact, these diets are often rich in dietary fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients that are not as prevalent in an omnivorous diet, contributing to reduced risks of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada agree that vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. They also affirm that these diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes. While it is essential that vegetarians carefully plan their diet to avoid deficiencies in nutrients typically obtained from animal products, such as Vitamin B12, iron, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, these can be adequately	1911	2006.903
"The Progressive Republican League is already exerting a nation wide and extremely helpful influence on the body politic and is undoubtedly forcing the Democratic party to take a braver and more patriotic stand than would have been taken had not this formidable revolt in the Republican ranks called forth such general and hearty approval on the part of patriots, regardless of party. The rank abuses of the public service corporations and the scandals connected with certain governmental departments, such as the Post Office, urgently demand prompt, fearless and searching investigation. SECRETARY MacVEAGH ON PENSION SCANDALS AND PENSION DUTIES IN a recent address before the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Secretary of the Treasury Franklin Mac Veagh strongly advocated pensions for government employes, while assailing our present enormous Civil War pensions. On the latter subject the Secretary said: ""We have a perfectly enormous Civil War pension list, which is not a credit to us. It never had a scientific or a just basis, although a worthy motive gave it origin. It has lost its patriotic aspects and has become a political list, costing the government about $160,000,000 per year."""	"He emphasized the necessity of reforming the pension system to reflect actual need and merit, rather than serving as a political tool. ""The current system,"" MacVeagh continued, ""operates under a set of assumptions that no longer hold. It needs to be rigorously evaluated, and reformed to ensure that it serves those genuinely in need due to their service, and not just as a broad entitlement."" His call for a more judicious and equitable approach was met with nods of approval from many in the audience, who recognized the unsustainable trajectory of unchecked pension expenditures. Furthermore, Secretary MacVeagh proposed the introduction of a merit-based pension system for all government employees, which would not only recognize their service but also encourage efficiency and integrity within the public sector. ""Such a system,"" he argued, ""would provide a much-needed modernization of our approach to public service compensation, aligning it more closely with practices in the private sector."" This stance, while bold, highlighted a growing consensus among many policymakers that the time had come for significant structural reforms. These reforms would not only address fiscal responsibility but also"	1911	1998.7499
Fig. 6. A Test for Reflex Ac tign and Motor Control. The apparatus as shown consists of a piece of glass in a frame which is struck by a rubber hammer. low grade defectives seldom wink. Another line of activity in the Vineland research department has been the gathering of statistics on physical growth of defectives.	These statistics are compared with those of normal children to discern any significant disparities that can be attributed to mental deficiencies. The researchers have meticulously measured various physical parameters such as height, weight, and head circumference at different age intervals. This comparative study aims to correlate physical growth patterns with cognitive development levels, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the overall impact of intellectual disabilities. Moreover, the research extends to examining the sensory responses and motor skills of these individuals. Special attention is given to their reaction times, coordination, and the ability to perform tasks that require fine motor control. Observing these abilities helps in evaluating the severity of the impairment and in tailoring educational and therapeutic programs that can better suit their developmental needs. In addition to physical and motor assessments, the research team is also exploring the emotional and behavioral characteristics common among the defective population. This includes studying their adaptability to changes, frustration tolerance, and interaction patterns with peers and adults. Such behavioral insights are crucial for creating supportive environments that encourage positive social interactions and emotional growth. This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of development are addressed, aiming for the most effective intervention	1911	2006.3246
"I will put up a fence between us. Then you won't need your miserable trees, and if you keep them the wind can't blow your pollen to us."" Slamming the door, John Henry left his brother's house. In the morning the fence was begun; in two weeks it was finished. It was a solid board wall, almost thirty feet high, and it was braced to stand the storms of fifty years. It sheltered the house and gardens of J o h n Henry from the north wind, and obscured only a little of his view. To John Adam it did great damage. It shut from his eyes his old home; it darkened his lawn; it cut off several hours of sunshine from the lower floor of his house. Both men had to turn their little workshops; they stood now back to back against the towering fence."	John Adam's garden, once vibrant with morning light, now languished in the shadow of the great barrier, its flowers wilting, its verdant patches fading into a sullen gray. The fruit trees, deprived of their vital hours of sunlight, bore scant and sour harvests. The brothers, each in his own domain, felt the weight of a silence deepened by the high wall that divided them. As the seasons passed, the fence became not just a physical division but a monument to their growing estrangement. The local folk whispered about the brothers’ feud, shaking their heads as they passed the towering wooden structure that split the landscape. Children, unfamiliar with the warmth that once existed between John Henry and John Adam, dared each other to climb the fence, making a game of the brothers' sorrow. Inside his dimmed house, John Adam often sat by the window, staring at the imposing fence, wondering if the loss of brotherhood was worth the gain of isolation. Meanwhile, John Henry, on the other side, busied himself with tasks, trying to drown out the quiet remorse that	1913	1972.1249

At 7: 00PM, as shown in the lower left of the sketch, the parcel has a temperature of 70F and a dewpoint of 50F, represented by the notation 70-50. By 9: 00PM, the parcel has cooled to 62F and its dewpoint has risen one degree to IF. The spread of 20 at 7: 00PM, has decreased to 11. At successive hours the temperature and dewpoint approach each other slowly until 3: 00AM finds them only one degree apart. After 3: 00AM, the spread decreases  to zero and saturation occurs. Cooling below the dewpoint as shown by the 5: 00PM temperature and dewpoint of 49-49 produces fog or dew or both.	This process is an example of nocturnal cooling, where the earth's surface loses heat rapidly after sunset leading to a decrease in air temperature near the surface. As the air cools, its capacity to hold moisture decreases, causing the relative humidity to increase. This is illustrated by the narrowing temperature-dewpoint spread. When the temperature and dewpoint converge, the air reaches 100% relative humidity, and the excess moisture condenses to form dew or fog, depending on the surface conditions and other atmospheric factors. The formation of fog or dew typically occurs during the calm and clear nights when radiational cooling is most effective. Without the presence of significant wind, the cool, dense air doesn't mix with the warmer air above, facilitating a rapid decrease in temperature near the ground. Clear skies further enhance cooling as clouds that might otherwise act as a blanket, trapping heat, are absent, allowing more heat to escape into space. As dawn approaches and the sun rises, the temperature begins to increase, reducing relative humidity. The fog or dew then begins to evaporate, disappearing as the morning progresses.

"The event has always passed entirely imperceptibly, as far as my experience in my family and friends is concerned. And I think many women can say as much for their friends and relations'. Before closing this letter I should like to add how troubled I am to see so many of your readers attaching so much importance to their husband's pre marital experiences. To begin with, a woman should sufficiently esteem herself to realise that there is no competition between the wife and the casual concubine. Secondly, that the man who is fond of women generally is 'the more apt to be fond of one woman in particular. Thirdly, that physical fidelity has no importance. Fourthly, that it is a mistake to expect it of a man, or even, for that matter, THE ""LADY"" COMBINED KNIFE and SCISSORS SHARPENER Regd. 512,986. FOR EVERY HOME.

Turn the handle in a smooth, steady motion. The internal mechanisms are designed to automatically adjust to the angle required for optimal sharpening. Repeat the process until the desired sharpness is achieved. It is recommended to lightly oil the blade before and after sharpening to preserve the metal quality. Furthermore, returning to the topic of marital trust and fidelity, it is essential to foster a relationship built on respect, openness, and mutual understanding. The complexities of human relationships and attractions are vast and varied, and as such, demanding strict adherence to an idealized form of fidelity can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and unnecessary strife within a marriage. It is more beneficial to cultivate a partnership where both parties feel valued, understood, and, above all, trusted. This, in turn, nurtures a deeper, more meaningful connection that transcends mere physical interactions.	1911	1999.3966

"The dense atmosphere and its glowing light prevented us from seeing any definite details upon its surface. Only three days late, we arrived at our home at Norbury on Monday the ist March 1910, about an hour before daylight. We descended quite unobserved, and having stowed away our good ship Areonal in its shed and made all secure, we astonished Mrs. Challen by walking into the house very soon after she had risen. She seemed truly delighted to see us back again after our long and unprecedented voyage through space, and as soon as our greetings were over she asked, ""Where is Mr. Poynders ? "" I said we would tell her all the news whilst we had breakfast, so she bustled about and got the meal ready very quickly."	"As we settled around the breakfast table, laden with the familiar comforts of home, we began to recount the details of our extraordinary journey. Mrs. Challen listened with wide-eyed amazement as we spoke of the distant worlds we had glimpsed and the celestial phenomena we had observed. The absence of Mr. Poynders, however, remained a poignant shadow over our tales. ""He stayed behind,"" I finally disclosed after a pause that seemed to stretch too long. ""He found something... or rather, something found him. A possibility of a new life, a new purpose that he couldn’t turn away from."" Mrs. Challen’s expression shifted from excitement to concern. ""But will he be safe? Will he ever come back?"" ""We hope so,"" I replied, trying to sound more confident than I felt. ""He made his choice with the same courage and curiosity that led us all to the stars. If there's a way back, he'll find it.""

Every strip of plate has initially the same curvature (gj, and the proof load is usually that which straightens all the plates together, so that the change of curvature in each strip is the same. If there are « strips, the modulus of section of each being \bcP (see Art. 66), the ft modulus of section of the whole spring at the centre will be gbd2, and not \b(ndf, since the strips are separate, and if the proof stress in each <3 Fig. 122a. — Carriage spring. ART. 83] 183 strip is / tonnes per square inch, the bending moment being \Wl (see Fig. 63)- - (xo) If this intensity of stress is to be reached by every plate at every transverse section of the spring, the moment of resistance must be everywhere proportional to the bending moment, ie. from the end to the centre it must be proportional to the distance from the end.	To achieve this proportionality, the width or thickness of the strips may be varied, or additional strips may be added or removed depending on the location along the length of the spring. This design alteration allows for a distribution of stress that is more uniform across all the strips, ensuring that each strip reaches the proof stress without exceeding it, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and performance of the spring. The total bending moment at any section of the spring can be calculated by integrating the bending moments across the strips. Considering each strip's contribution, the total resistance offered by the spring against bending forces can be expressed as the sum of the moments of resistance of each strip. This sum must match the applied bending moment to prevent any permanent deformation or failure. In practical applications, it's also important to consider the impact of repeated loading and unloading cycles, which can lead to fatigue in the material. The design should ensure that the stress levels in all parts of the spring remain within safe limits under dynamic loading conditions. This often requires detailed analysis and testing to validate the durability and performance of the spring under expected operational conditions	1908	1977.6959
The introduction of a certain amount of damping reduces the high frequency oscillations to small amplitude and brings out the slower movements much more prominently, as seen in Fig. 24. 6. With the exception of Fig. 28 the diagrams can be directly compared with one another for the amplitude of fluctuations. The correspondence of the time scales is not quite so general, but any deviations will oe noted as they occur. 7. Explanation of the diagrams. — In the records as reproduced horizontal distances are proportional to time. The scale is such that the whole record is obtained in 30 sees, when making experiments on a 6 in. model channel. Tfae corresponding time for a record of equal length from the 4 f t. channel is 4 mins., ie., the times are proportional to the linear dimensions. (See Appendix, p.	112, for a detailed explanation of the scaling laws applied.) Vertical distances in the diagrams represent the amplitude of oscillation, with each division on the graph corresponding to a specific increment in amplitude. The zero line in each diagram is the baseline from which oscillations are measured.  8. Calibration of the apparatus. — Before any experiments are conducted, it is crucial to calibrate the equipment to ensure accuracy in the readings. This involves setting the zero level and verifying the scale for both time and amplitude against known standards. Calibration must be repeated at regular intervals during the experiment series to account for any potential drift in the equipment settings. 9. Method of measurement. — The oscillations are detected using a sensitive transducer connected to the test setup. The output from the transducer is fed into an oscilloscope, where it is displayed as a waveform. The oscilloscope's trace is then photographed to produce the diagrams seen in the figures. Each experiment is run multiple times to ensure repeatability and reliability of the results. 10. Analysis of results. — The photographs of the oscilloscope traces	1912	1962.9772
The sweet class is divided into the hard and soft shell types. The hard shell type is scarcely grown, but the soft shell type produces the edible almonds of commerce. The bitter almond has a hard shell and Its chief use is as a stock for the cultivated kinds. It is also grown in the Mediterranean district for the bitter kernel, which is used In the manufacture of flavouring extracts and prussic acid. The Almond is cultivated in a very limited area confined mostly to a few small districts in California, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. The tree is nearly as hardy as the peach, but on account of the flowers opening so very early, they are almost always destroyed by frost, except in a few favoured districts. The tree comes into bearing from two to four years after budding, and is generally at its best when from six to nine years of age. Five pounds of hulled almonds per tree is reported as a good average crop in California orchards.	The cultivation of almonds requires careful attention to irrigation, as the tree is quite susceptible to both drought and waterlogging. The soil preferred is deep, well-drained sandy loam, though almonds are adaptable to many soil types as long as they are not waterlogged. Pruning is essential for promoting good air circulation and sunlight penetration, which are critical for the health of the tree and the quality of the fruit produced.  In terms of pest management, almond growers must be vigilant against a variety of threats including the navel orangeworm, peach twig borer, and various fungal diseases such as shot hole and brown rot. Integrated pest management strategies, including the use of pheromone traps and biological control agents, are commonly employed to minimize pesticide use and promote a more sustainable agricultural practice. From a commercial perspective, the almond market has seen substantial growth due to increasing consumer demand for healthy snack options and almond-based products like milk, butter, and flour. This has encouraged more extensive planting and research into more resilient and productive varieties. Advances in agricultural technology, including mechanized harvesting and improved irrigation systems	1914	1992.0225
73. The shearing force at B is 8 tonnes, and increases by a further 8 tonnes to 16 at C, where it decreases by 30 tonnes to 14 of opposite sign. From C to A it changes by 16 to 2 tonnes at A, changing sign and passing through zero between C and A. Fig. 73. The section which has a (mathematical) maximum bending moment between A and C is that for which the shearing force is zero, and since the shear is 2 tonnes at A and falls off at 1 tonne per foot run, the zero value will be, at a section D, 2 feet from A. The bending moment at C is — (8 x 8) + (8 X 4) = 96 tonnes feet At 4 feet from B it is — (8 X 4) + (4 X 2) = 40 tonnes feet Between A and C, at a distance x from A, it is — x (x \ xx -- 2x or *{2~2) which is zero, for x = 4 feet, ie.	at section D, which is 2 feet from A towards C. This is the point of contraflexure where the bending moment changes sign. To compute the bending moment at any point x from A within the section AD, the bending moment M(x) can be expressed by integrating the shearing force equation over the distance x, starting from A. Given the linear change in shearing force, if we let \( S(x) \) be the shearing force at a distance x from A, then \( S(x) = 2 - x \). The bending moment at a distance x from A is given by the integral of the shearing force from 0 to x: \[ M(x) = \int_0^x (2 - t) \, dt = \left[2t - \frac{t^2}{2}\right]_0^x = 2x - \frac{x^2}{2} \] Therefore, at x = 2 feet (section D), the bending moment will be: \[ M(2) = 	1908	1978.7435
There were first and second class passengers, and in the third some Arabs, Albanians, Greeks, Jews, but none of them counted. The peasant pilgrims were everywhere. Four hundred were accommodated in the parts of the hold unoccupied by cargo. I went down the dark ladders into the bowels of the ship and saw how they lived there. I had not as yet found a place for myself, and cold nights were in prospect. The hold was something never to bo forgotten for the crush there, the darkness, the foulness, and the smell.	Beds were not to be had; instead, the pilgrims lay huddled together on rough mats and thin, tattered blankets spread directly on the hard, grimy floor. Each person seemed to carve out whatever small space they could claim amidst the chaos. The air was thick with the odors of unwashed bodies, mingled with the pungent smell of various foods and the musty dampness inherent to such a confined, unventilated space. Children cried intermittently, their voices echoing strangely in the cramped quarters, blending with the occasional coughs and muttered prayers of adults. Oil lamps, sparsely distributed and flickering dimly, cast long, unstable shadows that danced across the walls and over the faces of the passengers. Here and there, a small stove was set up, around which groups gathered to share warmth and whatever meal they could manage from their meager provisions. The atmosphere was one of resigned endurance. Conversations were held in hushed, weary tones; the reality of the long journey ahead weighed heavily on everyone. Despite the discomfort and the overcrowding, there	1913	1984.9269

Continuous Beams; any Loading. — Let the diagrams of bending moment APB and BQC be drawn for any two consecutive spans AB or and B.C."	For span AB, consider a point P where the bending moment is maximum. If the loading is uniform and the beam is simply supported, the maximum moment occurs at the mid-point of the span and is given by \( M_{max} = \frac{w \times l^2}{8} \) where \( w \) is the distributed load per unit length and \( l \) is the length of the span.  For span BC, let point Q be the point of maximum moment. Again, if the span is uniformly loaded and simply supported, the maximum moment at Q will be identical in form to that at P, \( M_{max} = \frac{w \times l^2}{8} \). These moments \( M_P \) and \( M_Q \) will induce reactions at the supports. The support reactions \( R_A \), \( R_B \), and \( R_C \), for the beams under uniform loads, can be calculated using equilibrium equations: 1.

"Set in close array in the shade of a cool cypress grove, the vertical tombs, with the tall, upright, formal trees, make a picture of unusual beauty. Among the other shops that I passed, some kindly faces greeted me behind the intimate appearance of their owners' wares. The lemonade shop had a friendly aspect on a hot day, and here I satisfied a liberal thirst with a dangerous, bubbling, yellow liquid that seemed the more safe from the impossibility of any germ living in its mineral ""lemon"" flavouring. Here, too, I bought cigarettes from an elderly Mohammedan from Servia, whose linen drapery sheltered my painting tools on Sunday, when Abraham Effendi's shop was shut. Though an Israelite, he for policy closes on Sunday, as the great sewing machine company which he represents is not a Jewish firm. Upon a certain day in Ramadan I came out to see Abraham Effendi, and it was already late in the afternoon."	"The streets had taken on that peculiar stillness that descends upon the city during the fasting hours, punctuated only by the soft shuffle of slippered feet or the distant call to prayer echoing from minaret to minaret. The air was thick with the scent of incense and the heavy sweetness of jasmine that climbed over the walls and balconies. As I walked, the sun began its descent, casting long shadows and painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. Abraham Effendi's shop was a small oasis of activity in the otherwise quiet street. The front door was propped open, inviting a breeze that stirred the hanging tapestries inside. As I entered, the familiar tinkling of the bell announced my arrival, and Abraham looked up from his ledger with a welcoming smile. Despite the day's fast, his eyes were bright, and his demeanor was as hospitable as ever. ""Ah, my friend, you come at a blessed hour,"" he greeted, his voice rich with the accent of his heritage.

I think you will agree that if this piece of work can be carried through it will be in itself a great encouragement to the Illuminating Engineering movement. I also took the opportunity of visiting Berlin during my return from Milan, and, as a member of the Council of the Electrotechnischer Verein of Berlin, I was also present at the twentieth annual meeting of the Verband deutschcr Elektrotechniker in Leipzig. During these visits I met many of our distinguished Corresponding Members, including Prof. Dr. Ulbricht, Prof. Dr. Budde, Prof. Teichmuller, Prof. Wedding, Dr. L. Bloch, and others. The German Illuminating Engineering Society.	is making considerable strides in the development and application of new technologies in the field of lighting. They have introduced several innovations that focus on energy efficiency and human-centric lighting, which were extensively discussed during the meetings. The exchange of ideas and latest findings in these meetings highlighted the progressive nature of lighting research in Germany, and the enthusiastic collaboration between engineers and scientists from various parts of Europe. The discussions also touched upon the importance of integrating aesthetic considerations with technical efficiency, a principle that is becoming increasingly central to modern illuminating engineering. This holistic approach aims not only to enhance the functionality of lighting solutions but also to elevate the human experience in both public and private spaces. Furthermore, the conference showcased advancements in LED technology, adaptive lighting systems, and the integration of smart controls, which are poised to redefine the standards of lighting design. The commitment to sustainability was evident, with numerous presentations detailing methods of reducing light pollution and improving the recyclability of lighting components. This visit was not only a testament to the vibrant activity within the field of illuminating engineering but also a reaffirmation of the international community's dedication to pushing the	1912	1989.2279
So, in the new construction, only such water will be excluded as is absolutely necessary, and the more permeable construction thus obtained will permit of the escape of a larger amount of heat. Water thus admitted will be conducted beneath the tracks to convenient points, and thence pumped out. To build a mile of four track subway in earth excavation, complete with roadway, signals, station finish, etc., may cost either two million or seven million dollars, or any intermediate sum. It is a question of local conditions. The same thing in rock may cost three to four millions. Ordinarily speaking, rock work would cost more, but in New York the rock dips sharply from the surface on its way down town, and the congested work is in earth, where the maintenance and support and reconstruction of sewers, pipes, ducts, vaults, and other invisible structures is a huge item of expense.	The deeper the excavation, the more formidable the challenges become. The need to shore up surrounding buildings, reroute traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, and maintain access to utilities – all these factors contribute significantly to the cost. Furthermore, the type of earth or rock encountered can greatly affect the duration and complexity of the work. Soft earth, while easier to excavate, requires extensive shoring up to prevent collapse and protect workers. Hard rock, though more stable, demands powerful machinery and results in slower progress. In some cases, tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are employed to cut through rock. These remarkable devices can excavate and simultaneously install concrete linings to support the tunnel walls, considerably speeding up construction and enhancing safety. However, the initial cost of such machinery and its operation can be substantial. Moreover, the urban environment itself imposes additional constraints. Noise ordinances limit operational hours, complicating logistics and potentially extending the project timeline. Environmental concerns also play a role, as measures must be taken to mitigate dust, vibration, and disruption to local wildlife. Ultimately, the construction of a subway system is	1913	1999.9823
All of them, however, appeared genuinely pleased to meet us. The hall was a large and very fine one, most chastely decorated in a style which reminded one of the Etruscan. It was beautifully lighted by artificial means, but there were no visible lamps, the light being diffused over the hall as equally as daylight is diffused. Many ladies were present, and clearly on entirely equal terms with the sterner sex. They sat down with us at the banquet, and did not remain mere spectators from a distance, as is sometimes the case at our public, functions.	The tables were laden with delicacies, each dish prepared with such care and artistry that they appeared almost too beautiful to consume. The centerpieces were grand, featuring intricate arrangements of flowers and fruits that mirrored the Etruscan motifs adorning the walls. The music, soft and melodious, floated through the air, enhancing the ambiance with gentle harp and flute melodies that seemed to weave seamlessly with the murmurs of conversation. As dinner progressed, the discussions grew more animated, touching upon topics from art and literature to the latest scientific advancements. It was evident that the gathering was not only a social event but also a celebration of intellectual exchange. The women, erudite and eloquent, contributed significantly to the discussions, their insights and knowledge adding depth to the conversations. After the meal, the guests were invited to partake in a variety of entertainments. Some chose to engage in spirited debates in the corners of the hall, while others listened to a series of short lectures given by eminent persons from various fields. The evening concluded with a performance of a newly composed symphony, its complex	1911	1966.6573
"Hear the burden of E. R. Taylor: Why hestitate? Ye are full bearded men, With god implanted will, and courage, if Ye dare but show it. Never yet was will But found some way or means to work it out, Nor ever did fortune frown on him who dared. Shall we in presence of this grievous wrong, In this supremest moment of all time, Stand trembling, cowering, when with one bold stroke These groaning millions might be ever free? And that one stroke so just, so greatly good, So level with the happiness of man, That all the angels will applaud the deed. Shelley, in the following stanzas of his ""Men of England, "" taunts the workers with their submissiveness: The seed ye sow another reaps; The wealth ye find another keeps; The robes ye weave another wears; The arms ye forge another bears."	Sow seed—but let no tyrant reap; Find wealth—let no imposter keep; Weave robes—let not the idle wear; Forge arms—in your defence to bear. Shall he, the lordling, hold by right The riches of the toil and plight? Shall he command where freemen toil, Or bind the hands that till the soil? Unite and bind your souls in truth, Stand firm, the vigor of your youth Recalls you, as it once recalled Spartan and Roman when they brawled. Awake, arise, or be forever fallen, And let your cry by every tyrant be heard, England, awaken from thy long slumber, And like a giant refreshed with wine, retake Thy own vast might, and let not power slake. Thus shall your will carve paths through mountains, And forge from fiery hearts undying fountains. For never yet was noble will That lacked the power its dreams to fulfill.	1911	1854.9357
For the woman who is going to lend her whole mind to these things, to take them seriously, following up their details to their fundamental principles, is going to be an intolerable, excruciating bore. Her efforts to be profound on trivial subjects should therefore be met with studied disregard. She should be effectually suppressed. The real danger of such a move on the part of the universities is shown very clearly by the success of this first move made by the University of London. The public appeal for funds has been met by a lavish and almost spontaneous response.	This overwhelming support indicates not only the public's readiness but also its eagerness to endorse and engage with such educational reforms. It suggests a shifting paradigm where the pursuit of intellectual growth and academic inquiry, even in what may traditionally be considered 'trivial' subjects, is gaining a valued place in societal norms.  However, the resistance to this change also underscores a deeper societal tension between traditional views of woman's roles and the emerging recognition of their intellectual contributions. The vital question then becomes not whether women should engage deeply in academia, but rather how their participation can be facilitated and respected without prejudice. Critics who fear the presence of women in academia as a move towards boredom and triviality perhaps fail to recognize the broader implications of such inclusivity. It is not merely about allowing women to study 'trivial' subjects profoundly, but about redefining what is considered trivial and acknowledging the value of diverse perspectives in enriching academic discourse.  Thus, the success of the University of London's initiative should be seen not as a threat, but as a testament to a progressive shift towards a more inclusive and intellectually	1911	2005.3168
Sec. 16. If at any count two or more candidates at the bottom of the poll have the same number of votes, that candidate shall first be declared defeated who was lowest at the next preceding count at which their votes were different. Should it happen that the votes of these candidates are equal to each other on all counts, they shall be declared defeated successively from the younger to the older Sec. 17. No ballot shall be counted in such a way as to make it effective in the election of more than one candidate. Sec. 18.	Each ballot shall be considered as one vote for the candidate for whom it is cast, regardless of the number of vacancies to be filled. If a voter marks more preferences than there are candidates, only those preferences corresponding to the number of vacancies will be counted.  Sec. 19. In the event that a candidate receives a majority of the votes cast in the first count, that candidate shall be declared elected. If no candidate achieves a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes shall be eliminated, and his or her votes redistributed according to the next preferences indicated on those ballots. Sec. 20. This process of elimination and redistribution shall continue until as many candidates as there are vacancies have obtained a majority of the votes remaining in the count. Sec. 21. If at any stage of the counting a ballot becomes exhausted, that is, if all the preferences marked on the ballot are for candidates already elected or eliminated, that ballot shall be set aside as exhausted and shall not be counted in any subsequent redistribution of votes. Sec. 22. The order in which candidates are declared elected is determined	1914	1915.3776
"Don'T you say so, father?"" That afternoon father told Alonzo he might as well harness up, for he'd got to get the colt sharpened, and mother thought she'd go, too. Alonzo did it with extreme haste, and when they had driven out of the yard he stood watching them as father had watched the young man. Only there was no relief on Alonzo's face. It was very grave. When the last jingle of bells had died on the air, he walked slowly into the house, kicking the snow as he went, as if even his feet had some doubt in themselves of the way they'd better go. He ran up the stairs to the shed chamber and looked critically about. It was very warm. He had had a fire there that morning, and the salamander still sent out a pleasing heat. Alonzo tucked in another stick. Then he got the broom and dust pan and carefully brushed up some chips and the dust of old wood. There was a last year's cobweb on the  741 window, and he pulled it down and gave the panes a brush. ""There!"""	he said to himself, almost satisfied. He stood back and surveyed the room once more, his hands on his hips, his brow furrowed in thought. It was a simple room, utilitarian in its furnishings, but Alonzo had always found comfort in its sparse arrangement. Yet today, it seemed lacking. He glanced around, pondering what could make it feel more complete. Just then, his eyes caught sight of an old photograph on the wall, a picture of his father as a young man, standing proudly beside the very first colt he had raised. Alonzo’s gaze lingered on the image; something stirred within him—a mixture of respect and a sudden, overwhelming responsibility. He realized that the room wasn’t just a shed chamber; it was a part of his heritage, a silent witness to the legacy his father was gradually handing over to him. With renewed purpose, Alonzo left the room and descended the stairs. He went to the living room where his mother kept her sewing basket. Inside, he found some leftover fabric, which he thought could make a nice	1913	1993.578
In connexion with some of this work the Aircraft Factory has had the assistance of members of the Committee, and of the National Physical Laboratory. Investigation into stability in connexion with the full scale experiments. — In relation to the work of the physical section special attention has been given to the question of stability. The investigations made have been carried out in close connexion with the researches at the National Physical Laboratory, and various modifications suggested by these researches, as well as by other theoretical investigations into the stability of the aeroplane have been tested. Various forms of tail planes and fins for use on machines of different types have been designed and tried in flight. Work has been done towards the computation of lateral resistance from the National Physical Laboratory results for struts and body models, and the checking of this information in flight.	The data obtained from these trials have been crucial in refining our aerodynamic models and enhancing our understanding of flight dynamics. Further, the collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory has enabled the development of new testing apparatus and techniques, particularly in the wind tunnels, which have significantly improved the accuracy of our measurements. These advancements have led to a more robust framework for predicting and analyzing the aerodynamic performance of aircraft under various flight conditions. In addition to experimental work, considerable effort has been placed on the theoretical aspects of aircraft stability. Theoretical models have been developed and refined to better predict the effects of design changes on stability. These models incorporate the latest findings from both our experimental work and ongoing research in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics. This theoretical groundwork is essential not only for designing new aircraft but also for modifying existing designs to enhance their safety and efficiency. Continued collaboration with academic institutions and other research bodies remains a priority, as it enriches our research ecosystem with fresh insights and innovative approaches. This collaborative effort not only pushes the boundaries of our current understanding but also ensures that our work remains at the cutting edge of technology and	1912	1995.5284
"Possibly, therefore, it was from the maternal side that Palladina had been granted the ""upward looking and the light, "" for Mrs. Gee was bubbling with initiative and pluck, and had been, from the hour when the necessity for acting as head of the family became imperative. Boss window cleaner Mr. Gee had been, in the palmy days before his ""attackt, "" and Mrs. Gee became a boss window cleaner, too. In his most dashing prime, however, Mr. Gee had not been such a past master at his vocation as was this brisk, comely woman with her head of vigorous grey curls, who breezed in and out of the houses where she worked, wholesome as newly washed linen. Aside from Palladina there were five girls, all younger, but no boys. Mr. Gee had been known to remark, almost tearfully at times, that he and Dandy, an almost spaniel puppy, were the ""only he's in the fambly."" As the girls ranged from fourteen down, Palladina, turned seventeen, was the only one of them who could help out her mother's earnings."	Thus, she had taken up the mantle of responsibility with a fervor that matched her mother's. Palladina spent her days assisting Mrs. Gee on the more demanding jobs or taking on smaller tasks independently. Her agile fingers and keen eye for detail made her a natural at the trade, and she quickly became known for the streak-free shine she left on even the grimiest of panes. The work was hard and the hours long, but Palladina found solace in the rhythmic motion of the squeegee across the glass and the satisfaction of a job well done. It wasn't just about cleaning windows; it was about letting the light in, both literally and metaphorically, into the lives of their clients and their own.  With each window cleaned, she felt a step closer to something greater, a future where she could perhaps move beyond the sills and ledges of the city. Dreams of further education flickered in her mind like the reflection of sunlight on glass. Yet, financial reality anchored these aspirations firmly to the ground. Mrs. Gee, ever the optimist,	1913	1954.9254
there some ruined castle — the snowy Carraras in the distance out of which Michael Angelo hewed the marble for his Moses, and far off on the horizon, where ocean and sky seemed to lose themselves in a mystical union, the Island of Elba like a lost ship in a sea of gold.	The sun dipped lower, casting a fiery glow across the water, illuminating Elba in a halo of amber light, making the island appear as a jewel set upon the ocean's expanse. The scene was one of celestial tranquility, untouched by the passage of time, preserved as though the very air were reluctant to disturb its composition. Meanwhile, the Carraras stood majestic, their snow-capped peaks a stark contrast against the softening sky, guardians of ancient secrets and artistry long passed. Their slopes whispered tales of toil and genius, a testament to the enduring struggle between man and nature in the pursuit of beauty. As the light waned, the castle ruins, too, took on a spectral beauty. Shadows deepened in their hollows, and the crumbling stones seemed to murmur of days when they stood proud and whole. Each stone a chronicle of histories lived and lost, battles won and peace treaties signed, all beneath the watchful gaze of the immutable mountains. The entire landscape was a tapestry of human endeavor and natural splendor, interwoven with the threads of	1911	1932.753
The simplest luminous forms are the bacteria. It is certainly difficult to see that photogenicity can be of any especial service to these unicellular organisms. Most, if not all, of the photogenic bacteria are of marine origin, and it is possible that some of them may be pathogenic to certain marine creatures when ingested, and the light thus serves to warn the bacterivorous plankton, etc., that these bacteria are dangerous food. Some species have been found to be pathogenic to Talitrus, a crustacean, which may serve as a case in point.	Additionally, it has been suggested that the bioluminescence could play a role in attracting larger predators to the bacterivorous organisms that consume the bacteria, thus reducing the population of these predators' competitors. This indirect defense mechanism, albeit complex and speculative, is fascinating as it implies a level of ecological interaction that extends beyond the immediate survival benefits to the bacteria themselves. Moreover, the light emitted by these photogenic bacteria may also serve a mutualistic purpose. For example, some fish and squid species harbor these bacteria in specialized light organs. The bacteria provide light, which the host can use for camouflage, communication, or attracting prey, while in return, the bacteria gain a protected environment and nutrients from their host. The study of marine bioluminescence also opens up broader ecological questions. The distribution and intensity of light in various marine environments can affect the behavior and evolutionary adaptations of other organisms, influencing feeding patterns, reproductive strategies, and even migration. As such, the simple ability of bacteria to produce light touches upon a complex web of life in the marine ecosystem, illustrating the intricate connections and dependencies that characterize	1911	2006.9769
"Oh, perhaps you don't know anything about me. But yet — I think you must; because — because there has been so much talk!"" "" Mrs. Bets ?"" said Marcia, slowly. Her eyes perused the other's face, which reddened deeply under the girl's scrutiny. Marcia, in her pale pink dress and hat, simple, but fresh and perfectly appointed, with her general aspect of young bloom and strength, seemed to take her place naturally against — one might almost say, as an effluence from — the background of bright June foliage, which could be seen through the open windows of the room; while Mrs. Bets, tumbled, powdered, and through all the juvenility of her attire — arms bare to the elbow and throat half uncovered, short skirts and shell necklace — betraying her thirty-five years, belonged quite plainly to the used, autumnal category of her sex. "" Haven'T you heard of me ?"" she resumed, plaintively. """	"I'm afraid I've made quite the stir in certain circles."" Her voice held a note of both pride and regret, a curious mixture that made Marcia more attentive. She nodded gently, encouraging Mrs. Bets to continue. Mrs. Bets sighed, her eyes glancing away momentarily before locking back with Marcia's. ""Well, my dear, it's a rather long and tangled story. I came into a bit of fortune, quite unexpectedly. A distant relative left me his estate. But with fortune, as you might guess, came trouble."" Marcia's interest piqued. ""Trouble?"" ""Yes,"" Mrs. Bets leaned in slightly, lowering her voice as if the walls themselves might be listening. ""Family I never knew I had suddenly appeared, friends turned foes, and the society columns had a field day. I was the subject of gossip, envy, and not a small amount of scandal."" Marcia's expression softened. She could see now the weariness etched into the other woman's features, a stark contrast to the frivolous, almost desperate vivacity"	1913	1950.1837
In connexion with the advertising illumination the mercury vapour lamp came in very useful, as the long tube lent itself well for glass signs where good diffusion over large surfaces was desirable. In this connexion he would like to call attention to the large sign erected over the Shepherd's Bush station, the canopy over the entrance to Bond Street station, c. Practically the whole of the lighting was done at 550 volts from separate lighting feeders from the sub station, which necessitated lamps being run in series. He thought the tendency would be for a minimum illumination of at least 0-25 foot - candle, not from the point of view of accidents, but because people were demanding more light.	The improvements in electrical lighting and the increasing demand for brighter, more evenly distributed light had led to significant advancements in the field. The use of mercury vapour lamps, particularly, had been revolutionary, providing not just efficient lighting but also contributing aesthetically to urban environments. The long, continuous tubes were perfect for signage, offering a sleek, modern look that was highly visible from a distance. This was especially important in bustling city areas where attracting the attention of passersby was crucial for businesses. Furthermore, the introduction of higher voltage systems at 550 volts allowed for more extensive and reliable lighting networks. Running lamps in series from dedicated feeders ensured a consistent and stable light output, which was essential for both safety and comfort in public spaces. The shift towards a minimum illumination standard of 0.25 foot-candles was indicative of the growing public expectation for well-lit streets, stations, and commercial areas. This level of lighting not only reduced the risk of accidents but also enhanced the overall ambiance of the environment, making it more inviting and secure for nighttime activity. As cities continued to grow and evolve	1912	2003.5282
"Though I seem to be dead and irresponsive, I feel as if I were made on the principle of a toy jumping jack, with some one pulling the string, holding my head back and mouth open. I must be a repulsive looking object, "" she continues. ""I must look like a fool, anyway."" To one who had known her even when but partially well, and had noted her most delicately feminine appearance and ways, it is only too clear that observation of the successive steps of her progressive physical degradation was not among the least of the sources of her mental distress. ""My throat and mouth are in dreadful condition. . . . My tongue refuses to work."	"It is thick and awkward, making speech a laborious effort."" She pauses, struggling for a moment with the frustration of her own body, before continuing her heart-wrenching account. ""Eating has become an ordeal I dread, and even the simplest words twist and refuse to be spoken. It is as if my own body has turned against me, leaving me trapped inside this malfunctioning shell."" The starkness of her situation is palpable, the decline in her physical capabilities casting a shadow over her once vibrant spirit. Her eyes, once lively and expressive, now often stare out in exhausted resignation, witnessing the betrayal of her own faculties. As she speaks, her voice is tinged with a bitterness that stems not only from her physical discomfort but from the emotional weight of her condition. ""I used to take such pride in my eloquence, in the small joys of conversation, of being understood and understanding others. Now, I feel as though I am fading away, becoming less of myself each day."" Her words, though spoken softly, carry a heavy burden—a mourning for the loss of her"	1911	2001.7858
"In addition, much greater reliability is secured by working two or more dynamos and batteries in parallel. This arrangement of equipment it is proposed to call the "" brake vehicle "" method, because under ideal circumstances only brake vehicles need be equipped. On the assumption that all Great Western passenger rolling stock might be equipped for electric train lighting, the percentage of brake vehicles would be 27, of dependent coaches 40, and of self lit coaches 33 for main line working ; while for local and suburban traffic the percentage of brake vehicles would be 39, and of dependent coaches 61. If the ratio of brake vehicles to dependent coaches were as 1 to 3, and there were no self lit coaches, the initial cost of equipping an entire rolling stock of some thousands of coaches would be reduced by about 35 percent as compared with self lit equipments, and the working costs would be reduced about 40 percent. The increased reliability due to a higher percentage of generator coaches is, however, of greater importance to the railway than reduction in cost."	The concept of centralizing the power source in brake vehicles not only simplifies maintenance but also enhances system resilience. By distributing the generation across fewer units, the railway can focus on upgrading and maintaining these specific vehicles to higher standards, thereby ensuring a more robust and reliable electrical supply across the entire train. This method also allows for easier scalability and adaptability in response to varying operational demands or expansions in service. Moreover, the brake vehicle method provides a streamlined approach during unforeseen failures. In scenarios where a generator coach experiences a malfunction, the parallel configuration allows other dynamos to compensate without disrupting the lighting and electrical services throughout the train. This redundancy is crucial for maintaining service continuity, particularly during long journeys or in remote areas where immediate maintenance may not be feasible. Additionally, this setup could potentially pave the way for future technological integrations. As the railway industry moves towards more sustainable and efficient operations, the centralized power units in brake vehicles could be adapted to incorporate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or energy storage systems. This not only aligns with global environmental targets but also reduces dependency on traditional fuel sources,	1912	2000.941
The presence of these pests and the discovery of methods of checking their injuries has worked for the interests of the careful, painstaking grower who now has a decided advantage over the slovenly cultivator. In other words, it takes more brains and application to raise fruit now than formerly. Comparative exemption from pests is often the case in new fruit areas but this exemption seldom lasts more than a few years, as is shown by the history of the new fruit areas in the Pacific Coast states where exceptional immunity from insect pests was enjoyed for many years, which might have been continued indefinitely had there been a suitable inspection law    properly enforced. The codlin moth and the plum curculio and other insect pests have come in and are now extremely troublesome and much care is required to hold them in check. State Inspection.	State inspection has become an essential part of agricultural regulation in many regions, particularly those with significant fruit production. The aim is to prevent the spread of pests from established areas to new regions and to manage their impact where they are already present. Inspectors are trained to identify the signs of infestation, assess the severity, and recommend appropriate treatments or preventative measures. In addition to state-led efforts, local agricultural agencies often collaborate with universities and research institutions to develop new strategies for pest management. These can include biological control methods, such as introducing natural predators of the pests, and genetic research to develop more resistant strains of fruit crops. The effectiveness of these programs largely depends on the cooperation of local farmers and growers. They are required to comply with regulations that may include the use of specific pesticides, the adoption of certain agricultural practices, or participation in scheduled inspections. Non-compliance can lead to the spread of pests, affecting not just the individual grower but the entire industry in the region. Thus, modern fruit cultivation demands not only agricultural skill but also an understanding of entomology, local laws, and community	1914	2006.3268
The slight degree of rational responsiveness is supplemented by a certain amount of support by the crowd. The fully developed moral life implies the growth of sentiments whose objects are more  abstract moral qualities or judgments, as duty, justice and right. Let us now apply these results to the case of some institution like the Church. The present sensitiveness on the subject of religious education bears evidence that there is an unconscious recognition of these principles. The religious institution has created a number of minor aids to enable it to meet all requirements. Absolute personal control, the corporate feeling of the church community are just as necessary as the body of doctrine.	These elements together foster a communal moral atmosphere that is conducive to the development of individual ethical standards within the context of the broader community. The church, in its wisdom, has thus not only provided a platform for spiritual expression but has also engineered a social structure that supports moral education through both direct teaching and the subtler influences of community life. This dual role of the church is crucial in maintaining the delicate balance between personal freedom and communal responsibility. The doctrines preached provide a framework for understanding moral and ethical complexities, while the community offers practical examples of these principles in action. This symbiotic relationship enhances the individual's capacity to internalize these values, which in turn strengthens the community. Moreover, the church's role in moral education is further amplified through its rituals and ceremonies, which serve to reinforce the values and principles at the heart of its teachings. These rituals, rich in symbolism and tradition, provide tangible connections to the abstract concepts of duty, justice, and right, making them more accessible and impactful on the congregant's moral psyche. In this way, the church not only addresses the immediate spiritual needs of its	1908	2007.2426
This is the customary way of fixing credit unless the members pay income tax, when their credit is naturally augmented. The pastor was the only member with a large enough income to pay a tax on it. Then the first general meeting was held — in all societies the first and final governing body of the bank, where the policy is determined, the expenditure which shall be made, and what amount they shall commit themselves to using during the year.	At this meeting, various roles were assigned and responsibilities defined, ensuring that each member understood their duties and the expectations placed upon them. The agenda included the election of the board of directors, approval of the annual budget, and formulation of strategic plans for the coming fiscal year. Members discussed potential investments, risk management strategies, and community outreach initiatives aimed at bolstering the bank's reputation and support within the local area. Deliberations were intense but conducted with mutual respect and a shared goal of sustainability and growth. The pastor, given his unique financial standing, offered insights into more sophisticated financial instruments that could potentially yield higher returns without compromising the bank's stability. His suggestions were noted with interest, and a committee was formed to explore these options further. The importance of transparency and accountability was emphasized, with members agreeing on regular audits and public disclosure of the bank's financial status to maintain trust among stakeholders. The meeting concluded with a reaffirmation of the bank's commitment to serve the community's needs and to operate with integrity and prudence. Members left the meeting energized, with a clear sense of direction and	1913	2003.0458
It was like a scene of enchantment as we watched those immense bands of glowing colours changing so rapidly and synchronising with the chords of music. Merna informed us that the lights of each vessel were electrically controlled from the keyboard of one of the musical instruments on the ship. This was followed by a piece resembling a grand chorale: then an intricate fugue was performed, the several movements being taken up in succession by the ranks on each side alternately, and apparently flung to and fro from one side to the other of that vast area in magnificent sequences and variations until it seemed that our human nature was so uplifted, and we were so filled with ecstasy, that we could bear no more. Many of the instruments were quite different from anything we had known upon the earth, and when some of these were unaccompanied the music sounded exactly like a grand choir of Martians singing in the heavens. It really seemed to us quite impossible that this concord of sweet sounds could be instrumental music, so perfect was the vocal effect.	The melody, weaving through ethereal heights, dipped suddenly into deep, resonant tones that seemed to echo from the very depths of the ocean beneath us. The effect was utterly transporting; celestial harmonies intertwined with the elemental rumble of sea and wind, creating a symphony that transcended earthly boundaries. As the fugue developed, the lights danced with increasing fervor, pulsating in brilliant hues of violet, emerald, and gold. Each vessel added its own unique shade to the chromatic spectacle, the colors blending and separating in a visual fugue that mirrored the auditory complexity. The crescendo built as more instruments joined the celestial choir, each adding a layer of depth and emotion to the already rich tapestry. Harps with strings of light, wind instruments that curved and twisted in ways that defied terrestrial design, and percussion that shimmered with the glow of stars—all contributed to the overwhelming beauty of the experience. As the final chords of the fugue stretched towards infinity, a hushed reverence fell over the assembly. It was a moment of pure, unbridled awe, a	1911	1997.9315
on either side between the false bottom and the channel walls. The measurements were made on a plate 10 x 60 cm. x 2 c mm. thick, with a maximum ordinate of 4-4 mm. (Camber 1 in 23). The results for the lift, drift, and lift/drift for angles of 0°, 5°, 10°, 15°, are plotted against the ratio A, where I is the span of the aerofoil, and h the distance of its leading edge above the false bottom. (For determination of the effect of a plane above the model, the model was turned over.) The values of l\h range from 0 to 10, corresponding to distances of the aeroplane from the ground ranging from infinity to one tenth of the span.	The data obtained from these experiments provide a clear depiction of ground effect dynamics, which are crucial for understanding aerodynamic performance near the surface. As the ratio l/h decreases, indicating closer proximity to the ground, there is a noticeable increase in the lift coefficient. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as the ground effect, results from the interference of the airflow patterns between the aerofoil and the ground surface, leading to reduced airflow velocity under the wing and increased pressure below the wing. The drift, or drag, measurements also show variation with changes in the l/h ratio. Typically, as the aerofoil approaches the ground, drag experiences a slight decrease due to the reduction of vortex strength at the wingtips caused by the ground's interference with the wingtip vortices. This effect is more pronounced at lower angles of attack. The lift-to-drag ratio, an important metric in aerodynamics indicating the efficiency of the aerofoil, improves significantly as the aerofoil approaches the ground. This improvement is most notable at lower angles of attack, where the reduction in drag and increase in lift synergize	1912	1997.7527
I am afraid M™ Wyld is asleep ; if that weight was off my heart it would be lighter, but some lucky time may come. My love to Clutterbuck and all friends from one end to the other. I can scarce hold my pen in my hand. Direct to me & Monsr., Monsr. G. chez Monsieur  Leger Munck a Franckfort — write directly and take care to put it into ye proper post.	I am in a state of such anxiety and anticipation, awaiting any word that might signify a change in our fortunes. Each day drags on, and with it, my hope dwindles yet clings stubbornly, for it is all I presently hold. The silence from M™ Wyld weighs heavily upon my spirits, as does the uncertainty of our situation. It is a cruel kind of solitude to be surrounded by whispers of possibilities that may never come to fruition. Yet, I must strive to maintain a semblance of composure, for despair serves no purpose but to further darken our already shadowed path. I implore you, do not delay in your correspondence, for each letter serves as a beacon, guiding me through this tempest of doubt. Ensure that your messages find their way securely, for they are precious cargo in these troubled times. Remember, amidst the tumult of our separation, the fondness and regard I hold for all our companions. Their well-being often occupies my thoughts, and any news of their circumstances would be most welcome. In these trying times, the bond of friendship is	1912	1878.3549
"I thought I couldn't be mistaken, ""' said a cool voice, and Page looked up, startled, at the man in Farwell's car, to see, between the high coat collar which had been thrown open, and the peak of the cap now pushed back, the lean, lined, shrewd face of Galen Corbin. ""There! What 'd I tell ye!"" exulted Ketchum. ""Didn'T I say he'd turn out to be some noted criminal? That story of his was a leetle too smooth!"	"Ketchum's eyes gleamed with the thrill of the chase, his voice tinged with the excitement of the revelation. Page, on the other hand, felt a sudden chill run down his spine as he gazed into the piercing eyes of Galen Corbin. The man's reputation preceded him; tales of his cunning and ruthlessness were common in hushed whispers around town. ""Mr. Corbin,"" Page began, his voice slightly quivering, ""I assure you, there's been some misunderstanding."" Corbin chuckled dryly, his gaze never wavering. ""Misunderstanding?

374 Lighting and Extinguishing Gas Lamps by Hertzian Waves, HITHERTO the automatic control of street gas lamps from a distance lias been accomplished almost invariably by one of two methods — ie., clockwork or pressure wave devices, and the latter have come into very general use during recent years. According to a recent number of The Journal of Gas Lighting, however, a highly novel method is being experimented with by the Paris firm of MM. C. & G. Grimmeisen, which proposes the application of wireless waves. By this method, it is suggested, the signal may be sent out from the works and the lamps ignited or extinguished at any instant with the same precision and ease as electric lamps. The mechanism is stated to involve three essential processes : (1) Turning on the gas at the main, (2) production of an electric spark or the incandescence of a suitable substance to ignite the gas, and (3) cutting off the gas from the burner.	The system relies on the use of a receiver connected to each lamp, which is capable of detecting and responding to specific Hertzian waves sent from a central transmitter. This transmitter, installed at the gas works or another central location, can emit signals that are coded to correspond to the direct control commands for the lamps—either to ignite or extinguish them. The receivers are tuned only to respond to these specific frequencies, ensuring that other radio waves in the environment do not trigger the lamps inadvertently. The technical challenge lies in the reliability and range of the transmission. The effectiveness of the signal depends on the distance over which it must travel and the potential for interference from buildings, other electronic devices, and atmospheric conditions. To address these issues, MM. C. & G. Grimmeisen are reported to be working on enhancing the sensitivity of the receivers and the strength of the transmission signal. Additionally, safety measures are critical. The system must ensure that the gas does not leak if the ignition process fails after the gas is turned on. For this, a fail-safe mechanism is incorporated that automatically shuts off the gas	1912	1997.3196
"With regard to the iodine value it should be noted that the theoretical number required by cholesterol is 68-4, and this value has been obtained for it by Herbig and Lewkowitsch, working with Hiibl's solution. Marcusson, however, found that cholesterol gave a very much higher figure when Wijs' iodine solution was used (109) than it did with Waller's acid iodine and mercuric chloride solution. In this case the same cholesterol gave the value 29. This discrepancy has not been explained. It has been noticed by Mottram, and confirmed by Fourie and myself, that the ""cholesterol"" obtained from the liver of rabbits 1 When aether is used BOmer recommends, in order to avoid delay from the formation of emulsions, that the following proportions should be closely adhered to : 100 grms. sat, saponified with 200 cc.of a solution of 200 grms. KOH in I litre of 96 percent. alcohol, is dissolved in 600 cc. of water and shaken with 800 cc. of aether, and then two or three times each with 400 cc of aether."	The aetherial layers are combined and washed with water until the washings are neutral to litmus. The aether is then evaporated, and the residue is dried at 100 degrees Celsius until constant weight is achieved. This method ensures that the cholesterol extracted is free from impurities that might otherwise affect its iodine value. The variation in iodine values obtained through different iodine solutions suggests that the reactivity of cholesterol with these solutions might be influenced by the specific chemical environment established by each type of iodine reagent. It is possible that the presence of mercuric chloride in Waller's solution could be inhibiting the addition of iodine atoms to the cholesterol molecule, thus resulting in a significantly lower iodine value compared to that obtained with Wijs' solution. Further investigations could involve examining the molecular interaction between cholesterol and these iodine reagents using spectroscopic methods such as NMR or IR spectroscopy. This could provide insights into the possible formation of intermediate complexes or the specific sites of iodine addition, thereby helping to elucidate the mechanisms behind these differing iodine values.

"People of rare quality and reality are portrayed, vital problems are inspiringly handled, and a love story of power and originality is developed to its logical conclusion. Love's Old Sweet Song. CLIFTON BINGHAM Mr. Clifton Bingham, who, thirty years ago, wrote the words of the famous song bearing this title, which is known and sung all the world over, has in this new novel — the first he has written — woven his sympathetic verses into a most interesting and human story, both dramatic and pathetic. Though containing only five characters (excepting the dog) it touches lightly and tenderly the chords of human life in a manner that will appeal, as in Molloy's song, to every heart. It is a book that will be appreciated by everyone who has heard or sung "" Just a Song at Twilight, when the Lights are Low, "" and should make an appropriate gift book to lovers of music.

"whirling arm, in a vertical position, with the mouth of the Pitot tube facing the wind, the tube containing the static pressure holes being tangential to the circular path. The so-called whirling arm or whirling table consists of two arms diametrically opposite: one is of fairly substantial construction and carries the propeller dynamometer, c.; the other is of much lighter construction and was the one used for the present series of tests, in order to keep the Pitot tube as free as possible from local disturbances due to the arm. The end 2 feet 6 inches of the arm 13 of fish form section (2 inches by J inch) ; for the next 3 feet 6 inches towards the centre the arm consists of a single piece of 1 inch steam barrel ; further the Pitot tube itself projects 1 foot 2 inches above the arm. Experience has shown that these precautions are quite sufficient to reduce local disturbances below a measurable amount. The Pitot and static pressure tubes were connected to a sensitive tilting water gange by means of "" compo "" tubing, the rotating connexions being made through two mercury seals, concentric with the shaft of the whirling arm."	The arrangement allowed for continual and accurate measurement of both dynamic and static pressures without significant loss of fidelity due to the mechanical movement of the arm. The tilting water gauge, calibrated with precision, provided a direct reading of the pressure differential, which could then be interpreted to obtain wind speed data. This setup was particularly useful for assessing the efficiency and performance characteristics of various aerodynamic profiles under controlled conditions. During the test runs, observations were meticulously recorded, noting the variations in pressure readings as the arm's speed was incrementally increased. This method allowed for the generation of a detailed performance curve for each tested profile, highlighting the critical points where flow separation occurred or where maximum efficiency was achieved. The data collected not only served as a valuable benchmark for theoretical aerodynamics studies but also had practical implications in the design and optimization of aircraft components, such as wings and propellers. The sensitivity of the entire system was regularly checked by conducting control tests under known conditions to ensure that the setup maintained its calibration. Regular maintenance of the mercury seals and the compo tubing was essential to prevent any leaks or air bubbles, which could	1912	1991.0117
Root galls result from the presence of low forms of life known as Nematodes and possibly also from a bacterial disease. Their life history is not well known. They are often exceedingly injurious but some of them do little harm. Prevention is better than cure and it is a good plan to refuse to receive nursery stock having such blemishes. They are sometimes prevented by using stocks that are resistant to such injuries. Winter killing may be confined to the twigs and roots or flower buds of fruit trees. Any of these injuries may occur in deep valleys, when comparative immunity is secured on the higher land. Winter injury to twigs and trunks.	Winter injury to twigs and trunks often manifests as sunscald, where the bark on the south or southwest side of the tree cracks or peels away due to rapid temperature changes. This can be particularly severe in young trees with thin bark. Wrapping the trunks with tree wrap or painting them with white latex paint can help reflect the sun and prevent this type of damage. Frost cracks can also form when the wood contracts rapidly in cold temperatures, creating vertical splits in the trunk. Proper tree selection and placement, avoiding exposure to harsh winter winds and sudden sun exposure, can reduce the risk of such injuries. Additionally, rootstocks chosen for their hardiness and compatibility with local conditions can greatly mitigate the risk of winter kill. It’s essential for orchardists and gardeners to understand the specific vulnerabilities of the species and varieties they plant. This awareness, combined with strategic planting and preventive care, can help ensure the health and productivity of fruit trees despite the challenges posed by cold weather. 	1914	2006.1848

You'Re hearing what all the mothers will say — that you bagged him here, and kept him all summer, disguised as a plain Englishman, and gave no other girl a hint!"" Mrs. Wilson's colour grew deep. Of course that was what everybody would think, if they were too farsighted to say it. Sunday afternoon, while Wilson was showing Beveridge the stables, and Mrs. Wilson had answered the latest household summons, the two escaped, Den ford and Aline. Though they wandered home two hours later from different directions, no one was in the least deceived."	Everyone at the estate knew something had transpired between them during their separate returns, yet the decorum of silence prevailed. The air was thick with unspoken acknowledgments and speculative glances as they joined the others for tea. Denford, usually so composed, seemed unusually animated, his eyes frequently seeking Aline across the room. Aline, for her part, maintained a serene composure, but her cheeks held a persistent flush that spoke volumes to the observant observer. Peter watched them with a mixture of amusement and concern. He knew his friend well enough to recognize the signs of a man deeply in turmoil, yet he couldn't help but feel a twinge of excitement at the prospect of this budding romance. However, the social implications of their association were not lost on him, nor the potential for scandal should the gossipmongers latch onto any indiscretions.

. . . (3) a common value of the constant for steel shafts being about 3-3. When the maximum twisting moment has been estimated, common working values of f, are 8000 to 10,000 lbs. per square inch. Suitable values of /, or of the constant in (3) will be found in manuals of machine design In long shafts the condition that the twist in a given length shall be within some assigned limit may require a larger diameter than considerations of maximum intensity of shear stress. The necessity of this torsional stiffness will be understood from Art. 167. 111.	Art. 167 explains that torsional rigidity, or the resistance to twisting, is critical in maintaining the functional integrity of a shaft under operational stress. For instance, in applications involving transmission of power over long distances through the shaft, ensuring minimal twist is essential to avoid power loss and potential mechanical failures. This is particularly important in precision machinery where even minor deviations can lead to significant discrepancies in output. Moreover, the torsional stiffness of a shaft affects its natural frequency of vibration. A shaft that is not sufficiently rigid may enter a resonance condition under certain rotational speeds, leading to excessive vibrations that could compromise the lifespan of the machinery and the safety of its operation. Hence, the diameter of the shaft may need to be increased beyond what would be required merely to handle the maximum shear stress, in order to enhance the torsional stiffness. This consideration leads to a more complex calculation in the design phase, where engineers must balance the material costs and the physical constraints of the shaft's environment with the need for mechanical reliability and precise function.

LITTLE LESSONS IN DIRECT LEGISLATION By George M. Hammell I. IF all political power originally resides in the electorate, and is derived from it, it is evident that the departments of government, legislative, executive and judicial, exist and operate by virtue of the electoral franchise exercised by citizen voters, and are directly responsible to the electorate for the performance of their functions.	"II. Direct legislation, then, is the means by which the electorate exercises its will directly, without the intermediary of elected representatives. This is most commonly done through mechanisms such as referendums and initiatives. In a referendum, laws or policies passed by a legislative body can be confirmed or vetoed by the direct vote of the electorate. An initiative, on the other hand, allows the electorate to propose new laws or amendments to the constitution, which are then put to a direct vote. III. The principle behind direct legislation is to enhance democratic participation by giving voters a direct hand in law-making, thus reducing the gap between the government and the governed. It is argued that this form of legislation makes the political process more transparent and responsive to the public will. It can serve as a check on the power of legislative bodies, potentially curbing corruption and mitigating the influence of special interest groups. IV. However, direct legislation is not without its critics. Some argue that it can lead to ""tyranny of the majority,"" where the rights of minority groups are overridden by the majority vote. Others point"	1911	1956.1713
Political Philosophy if this view is correct, has concerned itself with two questions which in thought are quite distinct. The first of these questions concerns the general conditions of social life; the second is the problem of Moral Philosophy. It may be asked whether this latter problem is properly the concern of Sociology at all. Sociology, it may be said, is a science, and science is to be understood in a more limited sense than that given above. A science deals with facts and the interconnection of facts. It discovers laws and makes predictions. Hence it tells us what has been, what is, and what will be, but it has no concern with what ought to be.	Moral Philosophy, on the other hand, deals with values and with normative principles of right and wrong. It seeks not merely to observe and describe, but to evaluate and prescribe. Political Philosophy, occupying a space between these two, thus grapples with the normative implications of the structures and dynamics identified by Sociology. It asks not just how societies are organized, but how they should be organized to promote justice, equality, and the common good. In this respect, Political Philosophy extends beyond the empirical confines of Sociology, incorporating ethical considerations about how societies ought to function. It brings in questions of legitimacy, rights, and responsibilities, which are central to governance but beyond the mere empirical study of social structures. Thus, while Sociology can inform Political Philosophy with its data and analyses, the latter ultimately transcends the purely scientific to address the deeper questions of ethical and political life. Therefore, it becomes clear that the role of Political Philosophy is to bridge the gap between the is and the ought, between the factual and the normative. This underscores the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling the questions of how	1908	2002.8102
"Mr. Galton's first utterances, though based on many years of study, pretended to be no more than the outline sketch of a science; it was necessary that it should be filled in by detailed researches, this, not merely with reference to the immediate subject matter of Eugenics, but with reference to the general application of biological principles to human beings. This preliminary work haa been carried on largely by Professor Karl Pearson and his students, and the results have appeared from time to time in the pages of "" Biometrika."" The intimate relation of these studies to Eugenics proper has been emphasised by the fact that the Eugenics Foundation in the University of London has been placed under the supervision of Professor Karl Pearson. The volume on "" Noteworthy Families"" is the first product of the University of London Research Fellowship in Eugenics. It consists of a study of sixty members of the Royal Society living in 1904 who possessed as many as three noteworthy kinsmen."	The work delves into the familial histories, achievements, and genetic traits that have contributed to the distinction of these individuals, presenting a compelling case for the hereditary component of excellence. The methodology employed in this study is rigorous and quantitative, adhering to the biometric techniques that Professor Pearson advocates. The analysis includes a variety of factors such as longevity, fertility, and the prevalence of certain diseases, alongside intellectual and professional achievements.  This comprehensive approach not only underscores the potential of eugenics as a scientific inquiry but also raises important ethical considerations about the implications of such studies. The promotion of certain genetic traits over others could lead to social and moral dilemmas, which the book acknowledges and addresses. By presenting data and allowing for an informed discourse, the research aims to foster a balanced understanding of eugenics, emphasizing its potential benefits in improving human health and capabilities while being wary of its misuse. Furthermore, the collaboration between various scholars across disciplines—genetics, sociology, statistics, and psychology—featured in the research highlights the interdisciplinary nature of Eugenics.

"To render an opinion admissible, it must ﬁrst be shown that the witness possesses superior skill and scientific knowledge in relation to the question. This must be done before the opinion can be asked.‘ An expert has been defined as nothing more than a man of experience in the particular vocation to which the inquiry relates, or as one having.peculiar knowledge or skill in reference to the subject matter of inquiry, or simply as a person instructed by experience.‘ They have been defined as “men of science, ” ’ “persons professionally '‘ acquainted with the sciences or practice, ” ““conversant with the subject matter, ’’ “’ “persons of skill, ” ““experienced persons, ” "" possessed of some particular science or skill respecting the matter in question.H No precise knowledge is required. It is enough if the witness shows an acquaintance with the subject as to qualify him to give an opinion.“ He is not incompetent to testify because he has acquired his knowledge from books, but he must have made the subject of inquiry a professional study and a. calling. It cannot be understood that a lawyer may, by a few weeks’ study of engineering books, qualify himself to testify as an expert engineer, or vice versa."" A witness who testifies that he is a mechanical engineer, that he graduated several years before from a university, and since then has been engaged in civil and mechanical engineering; that he has given some study to the investigation of the strength of grindstones, and the safe rate of speed at which such stones of various size might be run, and that he ' Grand R. L & D. R Co, 1; Chesebro "" Folks 0."	New York Supp. 1, and others, is presumed to have the necessary expertise to give a credible opinion on the matter at hand. His education and practical experience in the field create a presumption of his qualification, which unless credibly challenged, stands firm in the eyes of the court. Furthermore, the court generally relies on the demonstration of continued professional engagement and specific study related to the case, as it suggests a depth of understanding beyond that of a layperson. In this context, the expert's testimony becomes crucial not only in providing clarity about technical aspects but also in influencing the court's understanding of the facts as applied to the frameworks of law. The reliability of an expert's testimony is often bolstered by their impartiality and the consistency of their findings with accepted practices and principles within their field. It should be noted, however, that the expert's role is not to decide the issue but to aid the court by providing a specialized perspective that helps to illuminate complex technical issues that are outside the typical knowledge base of the court. This is instrumental in ensuring that justice is not only done but seen	1913	1972.2094
"Long continued sickness may be a cause for removal from office, but until removed he is entitled to his salary.‘ When a person is employed to perform certain duties it is presumed that he will attend to them personally. If the servant delegates such duties to another without notice to his employer it will justify his discharge.lo Such contracts include those for the services of engineers, architects, lawyers, physicians, playwrights, opera singers, and even domestic servants. The contracts cannot be transferred nor assigned, nor can the services be delegated.""

The employer has the right to expect the level of competence and skill that was promised and reasonably required for the job. If it becomes evident that the employee lacks the necessary abilities, it is not only within the employer's rights to terminate the employment, but it may be necessary to do so to prevent further damage or inefficiency within the organization. Furthermore, it is important to note that while the employer must act within the bounds of the contract and any applicable employment laws, the protection against incompetence is a fundamental aspect of maintaining standards within any professional or operational environment. This protection ensures that the quality of work is not compromised, and that the interests of the business or institution are safeguarded. In cases where incompetence or incapacity is identified, it is advisable for employers to document instances and provide evidence of the deficiencies observed. This documentation can be crucial if the termination of employment leads to legal disputes or claims of unfair dismissal. Proper procedural fairness, including giving the employee a chance to respond to the allegations and improve their performance, should be observed to ensure that the dismissal	1913	1981.1956
Later the production of carbonic acid decreases and the animal again becomes indifferent to light and can move in any other direction. Then the production of carbonic acid increases again and the animal goes again, for a short time, toward the light . Such animals finally gather at the lighted side of the vessel because the algebraic sum of the movements in the other directions becomes zero according to the law of chance. But it is plain that such animals do not reach the source of light by a straight path. A writer who is not trained to interpret the variations in the behaviour of such an animal chemically and physiologically, can naturally give no explanation of their significance.	The movements of these creatures are not a simple response to a stimulus but rather a complex interplay between their physiological state and the environmental cues they perceive. The fluctuating levels of carbonic acid in their systems prompt them to move intermittently towards the light, not as a deliberate act of navigation, but as a reflexive response to changing internal conditions. This erratic behavior illustrates the principle that animal motion is not always directed or purposeful, but can be the result of physiological changes that temporarily alter their responsiveness to stimuli. Moreover, this observation highlights the importance of understanding the biochemical processes underlying animal behaviors. Without knowledge of the internal states influencing these movements, one might mistakenly attribute purpose where there is none, or fail to recognize the adaptive significance of what might seem like random activity. Thus, the study of such behaviors demands a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from biochemistry, neurology, and ecology to fully understand the complex mechanisms driving the actions of living organisms.	1911	2003.7562
His responsibility, therefore, is fully discharged to his child only when he does for it all that he individually can, first, immediately by his own powers in his individual home and next by his mediate powers in the school, the hospital, the city as a whole, to secure the nurture and education of his child towards full citizenship. Here I am not concerned with any practical consequences that flow from the theory. That would lead me into politics, with which a Sociological Society has nothing to do except after the fact. What I have sought here to indicate is that the actualities of our present practice demand something a little more subtle, a little more thoroughgoing, than the abstract parenthood and the abstract citizenship that have for so many years been filling us with weariness and confusion. X. Illustration from Recent Edinburgh Investigation. If it were necessary to give a reason for discussing the family, it would be difficult to find one better than the recent investigation in Edinburgh.	This study revealed that numerous families, despite living in a society with established institutions and resources, still face significant challenges in securing basic needs and educational opportunities for their children. The investigation underscored the gaps between the ideal of comprehensive social support and the reality experienced by many. It highlighted how crucial it is for both individual parents and community systems—like schools, healthcare facilities, and municipal services—to work in harmony to ensure the well-being and development of every child. The findings from Edinburgh serve not only as a microcosm of larger societal issues but also as a call to action for more integrated and effective support systems. They remind us that while the responsibility of parenthood is deeply personal, it is also undeniably political in that the structures of society must support the efforts of parents. The duty extends beyond providing mere sustenance and education; it encompasses fostering an environment where emotional, social, and cognitive development is equally prioritized, enabling children to grow into well-rounded and capable adults. Thus, while the Sociological Society may not engage directly in political advocacy, the implications of such findings inevitably lead to a	1908	2005.3683
So the portion of the trunk of an apple    tree that is exposed to the direct rays of the midday sun may start into growth independently of the rest of the tree. Injuries from birds. Birds are often very injurious by eating cherries, raspberries and some other fruits. At times they become so exceedingly injurious that it may be necessary to use the shot gun, but as a rule the birds that commit these depredations are very helpful in destroying large numbers of injurious insects and the toll they take in fruit is not more than they are justly entitled to. The yellow belly Sapsucker is a bird that often girdles the larger branches of our choicest trees. He should be destroyed. Partridges and perhaps quail will sometimes eat the buds of our fruit trees in winter. They may be kept off by giving them a shock of grain to work on instead. Injuries to trees by cattle. In remote sections deer will browse the twigs off fruit trees and break them down.	Cattle and other livestock can also cause significant damage to fruit trees by trampling around the base, compacting the soil, and damaging the root systems. This compaction inhibits the tree's ability to absorb water and nutrients effectively, leading to weakened health and reduced fruit production. Additionally, animals may strip bark from the trees, which can expose the underlying tissues to pests and diseases, potentially killing the tree if the damage is extensive. To protect fruit trees from cattle and other large animals, it is advisable to erect sturdy fencing around the orchard. The fence should be high enough to prevent animals from jumping over and robust enough to withstand any attempts to break through. Alternatively, individual tree guards can be used to encircle each trunk, offering protection from physical damage while still allowing the tree ample space to grow. It is also essential to regularly inspect the orchard for any signs of animal intrusion or damage. Prompt repairs to fences and tree guards, along with measures to deter wildlife, can help maintain the health and productivity of the fruit trees. By taking these precautions, farmers and gardeners can ensure that	1914	2006.7426
The winter of 1908, and for a year before that and a year after, the government school teacher at Point Barrow was Mr. Charles W. Hawkesworth. Mr. Hawkesworth was a New england er, a graduate of Bowdoin, a fine type of man of the sort that is rare even in New England and yet typical of New England. He said, and I agreed with him, that he thought the Eskimo boys and girls at Barrow had as much native intelligence as boys and girls of a similar age and the same grade in school in Massachusetts or New Hampshire. But I told him that, admitting all that, I did not believe they were getting from the books which they read and the lectures which he delivered to them the same ideas that pupils in aMassachusetts school would get, for their environment was so essentially different from that described in the books that many a thing which is a plain statement to a boy in Massachusetts must be, to the boy of northern Alaska, a riddle without a key. Apparently Mr. Hawkesworth did not fully agree with me in this, but an examination in United States history which he held shortly after gave results that Vol. CXXVII.	were quite revealing. The Eskimo students, while adept at memorizing facts, struggled to contextualize the historical events within their own experiences and surroundings. This was especially apparent in their understanding of concepts like the American Revolution and the Civil War, which were far removed not only in time but also in cultural and environmental context. Mr. Hawkesworth noted this discrepancy with a mix of surprise and contemplation. He acknowledged that perhaps there was a need to adapt the educational content to make it more relatable to his students’ lives and surroundings. This realization led him to incorporate local history and traditional knowledge into his curriculum, blending it with the broader American history to bridge the gap between the two worlds. He started inviting local elders to share stories and lessons from Inupiat history and culture. This approach not only enriched the students' learning experience but also fostered a deeper respect for their own heritage among them. The elders spoke about the long-standing traditions of whaling, the significance of the seasonal migrations, and the survival skills that had been passed down through generations, which were as crucial for the community's	1913	2007.7582

Hughes, LR 6 QB 597, which illustrates the importance of distinguishing between what parties actually agree upon versus their subjective beliefs or understandings. Additionally, for a comprehensive understanding of the doctrine of estoppel as it pertains to contractual agreements, one should consider the ruling in Jordan v.

This doctrine is crucial in cases where explicit contractual terms may be lacking, but	1913	1949.1595
Seedling Labrusca grapes are frequently white or greenish in colour. The cultivated grapes of this class have perfect flowers with well developed stamens. They also cross readily with the European wine grape, the River Bank and several other native grapes. (2) River Bank or Frost grape (Vitis riparia), the common wild grape found far north in Canada and in the northern United States, is as yet scarcely cultivated, but it is probable that some of its hybrids wll prove valuable for cold locations. This grape has thin, smooth foliage, green on both sides; short jointed wood and perfect or staminate flowers. The vines bearing the staminate flowers generally make an extremely rapid    growth and produce a great number of delightfully fragrant flowers but no fruit.	(3) The Muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), predominantly found in the southeastern United States, is another species worth mentioning. Unlike the River Bank grape, the Muscadine is extensively cultivated, particularly for its ability to thrive in humid and hot climates where other grape species struggle. Its distinct thick, tough skin and musky flavor set it apart from other varieties. Muscadine grapes are usually bronze or dark purple when ripe and are primarily used for making jams, jellies, and wine. Further, the resilience of Muscadine grapes against pests and diseases makes them a favorable choice for growers in their native regions. Their vines are vigorous and capable of producing large quantities of fruit, which are borne on unique, separate female and male plants. This dioecious nature requires careful consideration in vineyard planting to ensure proper pollination. (4) The Concord grape (Vitis labrusca 'Concord'), perhaps the most famous of the Labrusca varieties, is renowned for its bold, sweet flavor and deep purple color.

As a matter of practice, therefore, the purchaser will pretend that he received the spirit and he will announce that fact. Some time later sickness occurs in a family or a valuable article is lost. The young man is appealed to, and in order to keep up the deception which he has begun by pretending to have received the spirit, he goes into as good an imitation of a trance as he can manage, for he has from childhood up watched the shamans in their trances.	He then delivers a message purportedly from the spirit, diagnosing the cause of the sickness or revealing the whereabouts of the lost object. This performance solidifies his position as a mediator between the spiritual and the physical realms, despite the initial pretense. The community, relying on traditional beliefs, accepts his declarations as genuine, thus reinforcing the cycle of belief and the young man's newfound authority. Such practices, where the line between deception and belief is blurred, are common in cultures where shamanic traditions are integral. The role of the shaman or the spiritual intermediary often necessitates a blend of performance, knowledge of cultural symbols, and psychological insight into the community’s needs and fears. Through these acts, whether initially deceptive or not, the individual often grows into the role, sometimes coming to believe in their own spiritual encounters and capabilities. This evolution from pretense to a sincere embodiment of the shamanic role highlights the complex interplay between belief, culture, and individual psychology in sustaining traditional practices.	1913	2005.7408
"For all ""explanation"" consists solely in the presentation of a phenomenon as an unequivocal function of the variables by which it is determined, and if in nature we find a function of two variables, it does not, in my opinion, tend toward progress to assert that this is a case of functions of more than two variables, without furnishing sufficient proof of this assertion. These writers represent the geotropic reactions of plants by saying that in certain cells starch grains are present which serve the purpose of the otoliths in animals. These starch grains are believed to press upon the sense organs or nerve endings in the plant cells concerned and the pressure sense of the plant is then supposed to give rise to the geotropic curvature. I have no opposition to offer to the assumption that the starch grains change their position with a change in the position of the cells, and I am also willing to pass over for the present the view that the starch grains form one of the two phases in the cell."	However, I must express my reservations about the notion that these starch grains act in the same manner as otoliths. The analogy, while intriguing, seems overly simplistic when considering the complex physiological processes involved in plant responses to stimuli. It is paramount to remember that the mechanisms of perception in plants are fundamentally different from those in animals. Plants lack a nervous system, and their sensory and response systems are mediated through different biochemical pathways and cellular structures. The hypothesis that starch grains directly press upon specific sensory structures within plant cells needs careful examination and more direct evidence. It would be more prudent to consider alternative explanations or mechanisms by which these grains could influence cell behavior indirectly, perhaps through changes in cellular biochemistry, alterations in osmotic pressure, or modifications in the distribution of growth hormones. These factors could potentially play a role in the perception of gravity and the resultant growth orientation known as geotropism. In conclusion, while the starch grains certainly play a role in the geotropic responses of plants, positing them as direct analogues to animal otoliths might be an oversimplification.

"They are termed flames, but are more probably immense volumes of incandescent gases. The corona itself is never seen twice alike ; 97 G  its shape and size vary at every eclipse, but the variation runs in a regular cycle from maximum to minimum. "" You will also observe that all around the corona, and extending a vast distance beyond it on both sides, is a fainter pearly light. This is what is termed the zodiacal light, and is believed to be the thinner portion of the sun's atmosphere. We can see it from the earth occasionally after the sun has set, extending far up into the sky in the form of a semiellipse, the base of which is over the place where the sun is."""	"The reason this phenomenon is more visible in the tropics than in the temperate zones is due to the angle at which the ecliptic intersects the horizon. When the ecliptic stands nearly perpendicular to the horizon at twilight, the zodiacal light appears more prominently, stretching higher into the sky. This is typically observed after sunset in spring and before sunrise in autumn. ""The zodiacal light,"" the lecturer continued, ""is composed largely of dust particles that orbit the Sun, possibly remnants from cometary tails or collisions between asteroids in the solar system's early history. These particles scatter sunlight towards Earth, creating the faint glow that can be observed under clear, dark skies away from city lights."" ""As the Earth orbits the Sun, our perspective on the zodiacal light changes, contributing to its varying intensity and visibility throughout the year. Additionally, during certain times of the year, the interplanetary dust is backlit by the Sun, enhancing the brightness and extent of this light."" ""This faint, yet extensive light serves as a marker of the Sun's presence below the horizon and highlights the dynamic"	1911	2004.8131
"""It is true that not a few of the old and popular proprietary remedies were originally favourite prescriptions of family physicians enjoying large practises. The medicines that were later put on the market had seemed to be peculiarly efficacious, and the doctor or some druggist subsequently began their manufacture and sale to the public. In recent years, since the craze for getting rich has become a national mania, a number of new preparations, some of them said to contain small quantities of opium, chloral, cocaine and other habit forming drugs, have been put on the market, and the charge is made that in certain instances the drugs contained in these medicines might easily lead to death through carelessness of the consumer, or in other instances there is grave danger of brain and nerve destroying habits following the use of the medicines."	The problem is exacerbated by the fact that these concoctions are often marketed under the guise of curing a plethora of ailments, thus appealing to a wide and unsuspecting audience. The allure of a quick cure can be irresistible, especially to those who suffer chronic discomfort and have found little relief through conventional medicine. This, coupled with aggressive advertising campaigns that tout miraculous results, leads many to overlook the potential risks associated with these substances. Furthermore, the lack of stringent regulations in the early 20th century meant that many such remedies could be sold without proper labeling of their contents, leaving consumers completely in the dark about what they were ingesting. It was not uncommon for these 'patent medicines' to be composed of nearly anything—from harmless vegetable compounds to potent and addictive drugs. The public's growing concern over these practices eventually led to calls for reform and the implementation of laws that required clearer labeling and honest advertising. This movement aimed not only to protect the health and safety of the consumer but also to uphold the integrity of the medical and pharmaceutical professions, which were often tarnished by association with such dubious products.

Instead of throwing away as a poisonous waste the sulphur dioxide formed in smelting their ores, the smelters are now collecting as large a proportion of this gas as possible for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. This they sell to the manufacturers of phosphate fertiliser. Instruction is leading to improved methods of farming, to the use of the phosphates made from converted smelter waste, the farms are beginning to yield crops which repay tillage, and the woodlands are improving. To complete this romance of industry reformed under federal compulsion, it need only be said that the manufacture of sulphuric acid is so profitable that the smelters would be run for that purpose now if for no other, and that their copper costs them nothing!	Indeed, the ingenuity of turning what was once considered an environmental nuisance into a lucrative side business not only exemplifies the potential for sustainable industry practices but also highlights a shift in the industrial paradigm. This transformation has not only remedied the previous damages caused by unregulated emissions but has fostered a symbiotic relationship between industries that was previously unimaginable.  The phosphate fertilizer manufacturers, once dependent on more costly and less efficient sources of sulphuric acid, now benefit from a steady, reliable supply. This, in turn, boosts agricultural productivity, which is critical in a time when food security is becoming a growing concern. The enhanced crop yields contribute to stabilizing food prices and improving the livelihoods of farmers who can now engage in more sustainable farming practices.  Moreover, the environmental impact of such an initiative cannot be overstated. By capturing and repurposing sulphur dioxide, these smelters are significantly reducing the volume of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere, contributing to cleaner air and a reduction in acid rain, which has plagued forests and lakes for decades. Thus, what began as a federal mandate	1911	2007.4819
Soap:  Whale Oil Soap, 1 pound. Water, 6 gallons. Whale oil soap or other cheap soap Is used for plant lice and other soft bodied insects. When the leaves are off the trees it may be used as strong as 2 pounds to the gallon of water. It is sometimes used in treating scale insects. Hellebore:  Hellebore, 1 pound. Water, 25 gallons. Hellebore may be mixed with three or four parts of flour and dusted on the insects, or it may be mixed with water and used as a spray. It is especially useful in combating worms on currants and gooseberries while the fruit is ripening, because it may be used without serious danger of poisoning the fruit. Pyrethrum:  Pyrethrum powder, 1 ounce. Water, 3 gallons.	Pyrethrum should be applied in the evening or early morning when the insects are most active. This natural insecticide is derived from chrysanthemum flowers and is highly effective against a wide range of insects due to its rapid knockdown properties. It is particularly useful in organic gardening as it is non-toxic to humans and animals when used as directed. The solution should be used immediately after preparation as its potency decreases rapidly once mixed with water. Bordeaux Mixture: Copper sulfate, 1 pound. Hydrated lime, 1 pound. Water, 50 gallons. Bordeaux mixture is a traditional fungicide and bactericide that can be used to control a variety of plant diseases such as downy mildew, leaf blights, and apple scab. It is important to mix the copper sulfate and hydrated lime in water correctly to form a stable suspension. Apply it as a preventative measure before the onset of disease, particularly during wet weather, which promotes the spread of many plant pathogens. Always wear protective clothing when preparing and applying Bordeaux mixture, as copper sulfate can	1914	2002.8286
The hard rim does not wear away continuously and gradually. Rifts are formed some distance from the edge, which allow the water to cut out huge blocks of the protecting conglomerate; and as these fall away in time, the stream may dash upon a shelf before it takes the final plunge into the chasm. Viewed from the brim, where one stands knee deep in the river, the gorge presents an appearance almost as magnificent as Kaieteur itself. Far below, the stream rushes on between forest clad slopes whose trees seem like so much moss; above, the bare cliffs rise to the level of the higher plain. Enormous boulders have fallen to the bottom, and the natives will point to some of them, which, their traditions say, are a canoe and its human occupants, carried over the edge and turned into stone.	The roar of the water is constant, a deep, resonant symphony that echoes through the gorge, amplifying as it bounces off the sheer rock faces. The mist thrown up by the tumultuous descent of the river hangs in the air, a perpetual cloud that shrouds the lower reaches in a veil of mystery. The sunlight, when it pierces this veil, casts rainbows that arch across the gorge, adding a surreal beauty to the rugged landscape. As you follow the river's course along the rim, the path narrows and the vegetation changes. Delicate ferns and mosses cling to the damp rock, thriving in the perpetual moisture. Occasional breaks in the foliage offer glimpses of the river far below, a white ribbon winding its way through the darkness of the deep gorge. The natives of the region hold this place in awe, considering it a sacred site where the spirits of the water and stone dwell together. They seldom venture close to the edge, respecting the power and majesty of the natural forces at work. Their stories, passed down through generations, speak	1913	1998.5005
Another computation shows the total amount of condensed vapour; so a simple division gives us the number of the droplets, and hence of the electrons. Then the total charge of electricity carried by all the electrons can readily be measured with the electrometer, and again all that is necessary is to divide this quantity by the number of electrons to find the quantity of electricity which each conveys. The experiment shows that the unit charge of electricity carried by the electron is always the same. Professor B. A. Millikan, of the University of Chicago, has recently confirmed this by a series of ingenious experiments, in which he isolates a droplet of oil and observes it through a miniature telescope while it takes up one or more electrons from the air.	The droplet is then subjected to an electric field, and its motion observed. By carefully adjusting the strength of the field, Millikan was able to determine the force exerted on the droplet and thus calculate the charge it carried. Repeating this procedure with numerous droplets, he found that the charges could always be expressed as multiples of a single, fundamental value. This fundamental charge, which we now recognize as the charge of a single electron, was found to be approximately \(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\) coulombs. Millikan's oil drop experiment, conducted around 1909, was pivotal in solidifying the concept of quantized electric charge. His meticulous measurements provided a high degree of accuracy, confirming the discrete nature of electric charge and the existence of elementary particles carrying this charge. This work not only supported previous findings by other scientists such as J.J. Thomson but also provided a more precise value for the elementary charge, which is a cornerstone in the field of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.	1913	1979.8628
So clearly established were the crimes committed in the interest of Lorimer that they could not even be questioned, and the conscience guided, self respecting and patriotic Senators of the Republican party, no less than the Democratic party, refused to degrade the Senate by voting for the election of this man who did not dare to resign and go before the people asking for vindication through a reelection. The corrupt bosses and corrupt corporations that have debauched our political life were intensely eager to secure the seat for Mr. Lorimer, and Mr. Bailey, the pretended Democrat, was found eagerly and eloquently labouring and speaking in behalf of this discredited Republican. When before has the state of Texas been so humiliated by the action of one of her Senators? Yet Mr. Bailey's pernicious activity in compassing the cherished desires of the corporations and the corrupt elements of plutocracy did not end here. There were two territories clamouring for statehood.	Oklahoma and New Mexico, both ripe for admission into the Union, found their fates intertwined with the political machinations far removed from their own soil. Mr. Bailey, leveraging his influence, sought to manipulate the proceedings to benefit those who backed Lorimer, ensuring that any legislation passed would favor the interests of the powerful rather than the needs of the many. His maneuvers were not just limited to speeches and votes; they extended into the committees where the details of the statehood bills were crafted and amended. The outcry against such blatant corruption was significant, yet the machinery of influence was well-oiled by funds and favors. The press, once a watchdog of democracy, was now muzzled by the same corporate interests, leaving the citizenry partially blind to the dealings in their own Senate. It was a time of disillusionment for many who held the belief that their representatives were champions of the common man. Yet, amidst this political turmoil, there were still those in the Senate who stood firm in their principles. They rallied against the pressure from party leaders and corporate lobbyists, advocating for a clean and	1911	1958.819
I wonder, by the way, if Mr. F. E. Smith has ever attempted to get through a work of Shakespeare's since the unavoidable encounters of his schooldays ; I wonder how many of those who, like him, prate so glibly about the glory of his genius, are capable of an intelligent appreciation of it. ... But let me be honest: I do not really wonder at all. I would — to use a vulgar expression — bet my last button that the Smithites' knowledge of Shakespeare is limited to a dim recollection of some dull and literally blank verse in an impossible dialect, coupled with a few rather obvious quotations for use in cultivated conversation and for impressing womenfolk. Do not let it be imagined that I mean this by way of a reproach to these inestimable persons.	"On the contrary, the situation is perfectly understandable. Shakespeare, for all his universal acclaim, demands a certain readiness of mind and a depth of experience that not every casual reader possesses. His language, rich and ornate, can seem a labyrinth to those unaccustomed to the turns and tropes of Elizabethan English. His plots, woven with the threads of ancient fables and histories, require a patience and cultural awareness that the modern pace of life seldom allows. Moreover, the very sanctification of Shakespeare within the educational system often serves to alienate rather than endear. When his works are taught as mere exercises in literary analysis, or worse, as mandatory hurdles to be cleared on the path to academic validation, it is no wonder that many emerge with no greater love or understanding of the Bard than they entered with. This is not to say that Mr. Smith and his ilk lack intelligence or cultural sensitivity; rather, it is to acknowledge that genuine appreciation of Shakespeare—or indeed, any great artist—requires more than the passive absorption of classroom teachings or the social currency of quoting ""Hamlet"" at"	1911	1955.8375

Roughly speaking, eastern Asia is already peopled almost to the limit under present conditions, while tropical Africa is but sparsely populated in proportion to ite capacity. Under favourable conditions of economic efficiency tropical Africa would be the home of nearly a billion blacks. Taken together, and allowing for a normal growth, these two ethnic groups may possibly increase in numbers until they shall cause the whites of Europe and America to dwindle into insignificance by comparison.	However, this notion, while speculative, suggests significant implications for global demographics and power dynamics. The potential for such shifts underscores the importance of understanding and managing economic and environmental policies that could influence these population trends. Moreover, the cultivation of political stability and infrastructure development in regions like tropical Africa could drastically change the living conditions and thereby support a denser population. In contrast, the already dense population of eastern Asia poses different challenges, including the sustainable management of resources and the integration of technological innovations to maintain and improve living standards amidst growing environmental pressures. The balance of maintaining cultural heritage while fostering economic growth is also a crucial factor in these densely populated regions. These considerations illustrate the complex interplay between geography, economics, and demographics that will shape the future of global population distribution. As nations and communities navigate these challenges, international cooperation and thoughtful policy-making will be essential in steering the world toward a sustainable and equitable future.	1911	2006.4415

Given the complexity of the calculations and the need to ensure accuracy in structural engineering scenarios, it is crucial to follow step-by-step procedures to determine the crippling load of the strut. Here we are given the yield point of the steel in compression as 20 tonnes per square inch and the modulus of elasticity \(E = 13,000\) tonnes per square inch.  Using the Euler's formula for crippling load \( P \), which is applicable for long slender columns, the formula can be expressed as: \[ P = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2} \] where: - \( P \) is the crippling load, - \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity, - \( I \) is the minimum area moment of inertia, - \( K \) is the column effective length factor, - \( L \) is the unsupported length of the column.

"It is, in his view, nothing more than a biological instinct dressed up in the garb of poetry and chivalry, a mere illusion fostered by centuries of literature and culture to sanctify what is essentially a primal urge. Yet, despite this seemingly cynical stance, there lies a deeper, more constructive criticism in his works. He does not dismantle these romanticized notions merely for the sake of destruction, but rather to clear the ground for a more honest and realistic understanding of human relationships. Through his characters and narratives, he challenges us to reconsider what we accept as the norm, pushing us towards a recognition of genuine emotion, stripped of its traditional embellishments. In place of idealized love, he offers a vision of partnership based on mutual respect, intellectual compatibility, and real-life practicality. His ""disillusionment"" is not an end, but a means to a greater depth of understanding—a call to see things as they are, not as we romantically wish them to be.

"Father Yevgeny, who made himself very conspicuous in all the arrangements, found a room set apart for clean pilgrims. I had settled down to a pallet on the floor of the general dormitory, and was wondering whether I would not go out and find some fresh and open place among the mountains, when Yev geny came across me and kindly brought me to his room. "" There's just one bedstead left, "" said be. ""I'Ve been looking for a likely sort of person to give it to."" This was very fortunate for me, as the Keneral room was soon so crowded with sleepers that it was impossible to get across without treading on arms and legs."	"The room Father Yevgeny led me to was small but neat, with a window that opened towards the east, offering a breathtaking view of the dawn-lit mountains. The bedstead was modest, made of wood with a straw mattress, but it seemed like a luxury compared to the floor of the general dormitory. I thanked him gratefully, and he simply nodded, a humble smile touching his lips. ""Rest well,"" Father Yevgeny said as he left, his voice soft but carrying an unmistakable warmth. ""The mountain air is crisp at night; it brings peace and clarity with the morning sun. May it refresh you."" As I settled into the bed, the contrast between the bustling dormitory and this quiet sanctuary was palpable. The room held a certain tranquility, a sanctity that seemed imbued in its very walls, perhaps a residue of many prayers said or confessions heard here.

Interest in city planning in this country may be traced to the World's Fair in Chicago. This fugitive city of plaster and staff awakened the enthusiasm of architects and landscape artists, and suggested to thousands the idea of the city beautiful. It was a vision that did not fade; it was a permanent denial of the assumption that the city must of necessity be an uncontrolled behemoth of ugliness and disorder forever dedicated to mills, factories, and workshops. If millions could be spent on a play city and experts be employed to make it beautiful, why could not the same intelligence and harmony be adjusted to everyday use ?	The question stirred the hearts and minds of many who returned to their homesteads inspired to re-imagine their urban environments. The influence of the City Beautiful movement, ignited from the ashes of Chicago's temporary splendor, was evident as municipalities across the nation began to adopt comprehensive planning strategies. Civic centers, grand boulevards, and expansive public parks became the new emblems of American cities, each component a testament to the potential for aesthetic integration into urban development. City planning became recognized not merely as an artistic endeavor but as a crucial element in improving the quality of urban life. Problems such as traffic congestion, inadequate housing, and pollution were now addressed with a holistic approach that considered both functionality and beauty. Planners and architects collaborated closely, drawing upon a variety of disciplines to ensure that the infrastructure and aesthetics of a city complemented each other, promoting efficiency and well-being. Moreover, the engagement of the public in the planning process began to be seen as essential. Community meetings and public forums became platforms for residents to voice their opinions and influence the development of their neighborhoods. This participatory approach helped to	1913	2005.589
"So in our towns, you may see holes in what should be domes of foliage, bits of sky through what should be hollow masses of translucent green, olives and yellows when there should be a brilliant verdure. More careful examination will show that not only is the foliage deficient in amount and defective in colour in carefully tended city trees, but their annual growth in length and thickness is less than that of their fellows uncared for in the purer air beyond the outmost suburbs. The much advertised ""tree surgery"" of today is a species of not altogether useless quackery, developed to treat a symptom in communities which do not yet recog  mze and remove the cause of disease."	The true ailment afflicting these urban trees is not merely a matter of individual sickness but a systemic issue tied to the environment in which they are situated. The smoke, the soot, and the myriad pollutants that fill city air contribute significantly to their maladies. These contaminants, along with often poor soil conditions and inadequate space for root growth, stifle the natural vitality of the trees, leading to the symptoms so often treated superficially by tree surgery. Urban planning must involve more than the mere planting of trees as decorative or shade elements. It requires an integrated approach that considers the holistic needs of these living organisms. This includes the provision of sufficient space for root expansion, the use of suitable species that can better tolerate urban conditions, and most importantly, the improvement of air quality within city environments. Moreover, regular maintenance programs that go beyond the occasional pruning or treatment of visible wounds are essential. Nutrient supplementation, soil aeration, and proactive pest and disease management strategies can help sustain the health of city trees. This, coupled with broader environmental policies aimed at reducing urban pollution, would address both the symptoms	1911	2004.4989

Feminists, consciously or unconsciously, are seeking but one thing, though they often call it by other names, to wit, ""The readjustment of the relations between men and women to suit present needs."" So I fear that — my friend and the Philistines notwithstanding — we must be forgiven if we seem to give sex questions an undue prominence. It is only the swing of the pendulum, and will right itself.

The movement has gained such momentum, the voices such volume, that the echoes are heard in every corner of society. The winds of change are sweeping through the corridors of power, and no longer can the old guards shut their doors and windows against them. We stand at the threshold of a new era, where the scales of justice and equality are being recalibrated. The old norms and mores are being scrutinized under the relentless gaze of progress, and what was once deemed immutable is now seen as archaic, ripe for reform. The conversation has evolved from whispered grievances in private drawing rooms to loud proclamations on public platforms. And it is not just women who are speaking; men, too, are joining this chorus, recognizing that the liberation of women is not the confinement of men, but the elevation of all humanity. The task ahead is monumental, certainly, and the road fraught with resistance and setbacks. Yet, there is no turning back. The genie is out of the bottle, the spirit unleashed, and it demands nothing short of transformation. So let us march forward, not in confrontation	1911	1929.161
"Mounting the steps of the conning turret, we then had a look at the earth, from which we were so rapidly moving away. It appeared about fifteen degrees in angular diameter, showing that we had travelled some thirty thousand miles from it. The full moon, as seen from the earth, appears just about half a degree in diameter — sometimes a little more, sometimes rather less ; so the earth was apparently about thirty times the diameter the moon usually appears to us. It was only a thin crescent where lighted by the sun, but well might M'Allister describe it as ""enormous, "" for it appeared still larger to him when he saw it some thirty minutes earlier and mistook it for the new moon."	"The surface details of the Earth, though blurred by the distance, were still discernible. The vast expanses of the oceans reflected the sunlight, creating a shimmering effect that contrasted sharply with the darker land masses. The polar caps, tinged with a brilliant white, stood out distinctly against the deeper blues and greens of the globe. As we continued to observe, clouds could be seen swirling in the atmosphere, casting moving shadows over the terrain below. The sight was awe-inspiring, providing a profound sense of the planet's dynamic and living nature even from our distant vantage point. Dr. Helmsley, our onboard geologist, pointed out specific features of interest. ""There,"" he said, pointing towards a particularly bright spot, ""is the Sahara Desert. Its sands reflect more sunlight and thus appear brighter from space."" Nearby, the lush Amazon rainforest appeared as a darker patch, a testament to its dense canopy.

And one by one our little conclave thinned, Passed into ships and sailed and so away, To drown in some great roaring of the wind, Wanderers themselves, unhappy fortune's prey. And Time went by me making memory dim, Yet still I wondered if the Wanderer fared Still pointing to the unreached ocean's rim, Brightening the water where her breast was bared. And much in ports abroad I eyed the ships, Hoping to see her well remembered form Come with a curl of bubbles at her lips Bright to her berth, the sovereign of the storm. I never did, and many years went by, Then, near a Southern port, one Christmas eve, I watched a gale go roaring through the sky, Making the caldrons of the clouds upheave.	Amidst the tempest's wail, I thought I spied, A figure steadfast, battling with the tide. It was her silhouette against the moon, The Wanderer, her sails torn and strewn. Her mast was bent, her deck was swept and bare, Yet still she fought, a ghost upon the air. My heart leapt up, my old soul stirred within, To see her brave the storm with such chagrin. Though years had passed and left their silent mark, Her spirit undimmed, ignited still a spark. I called her name into the howling wind, Praying she’d hear me, praying she'd been pinned. But as quick as she appeared, she vanished from view, Swallowed by the night, into the black she flew. The storm calmed down, the sea’s rage met its end, Leaving me to ponder, my mythical, lost friend. Years more have gone, and still I watch the sea, For that brave vessel which once fled from me.

These results obtained by experiment justify, therefore, the assertion that the problem  of urban smoke is one of gases as well as solids, of poisonous fumes as well as inconvenient soot. Turning now from cities, in which the growth of plants is purely for pleasure, and by no means natural or commercially profitable, we may ask what are the effects of smelting and other works from which poisonous fumes may be discharged? Manufactories of certain chemicals, or of materials in the preparation of which poisonous substances may be volatilized, and establishments in which sulphurous ores are roasted either for the extraction of the metal or in order to obtain sulphur for the preparation of sulphuric acid, will affect surrounding vegetation more or less seriously. Even locomotive smoke injures the plants along the railroads, as anyone may observe. The herbaceous plants along the track, but quite beyond the reach of steam, often show burned spots on their leaves and stems.	This damage is primarily due to the sulphur compounds and other harsh pollutants emitted from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels used in locomotives. Furthermore, industries that produce heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium also contribute significantly to environmental contamination. These metals can be airborne and eventually settle on plants, inhibiting their growth by altering the soil pH, affecting nutrient absorption, and causing direct toxicity to plant cells. In areas close to zinc smelters, for instance, the high concentration of zinc in the soil can severely diminish plant biodiversity. Zinc, although a necessary trace element for plants, becomes toxic at higher concentrations, leading to chlorosis and stunted growth. Similarly, copper smelting can release arsenic and lead, posing not only a risk to plant life but also to animals and humans who rely on these plants for food. Addressing these issues involves implementing stricter emission controls and adopting newer technologies that reduce the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere. For example, scrubbers and filters can be used to capture sulphur dioxide and heavy metals before they are able to escape into	1911	2006.659
"""There is only one way to accomplish this. A firm and united stand on the part of frtaiJs of medical freedom for the principle involved will win. A large and permanent organisation of our forces extending throughout the country, for the purpose of keeping alive this vital issue, will assure victory. We desire our friends to assist us by recruiting all their friends in this great cause. ""Everyone interested should constitute himself a committee to enlarge the membership of our organisation."	This can be done by explaining the importance of the issue at hand and by showing how the preservation of medical freedom directly impacts each individual and the community at large. We must disseminate information, hold meetings, and organize rallies to foster awareness and support. It is crucial that our message reaches every corner of the nation, penetrating urban centers and rural areas alike. Furthermore, we must engage with legislators, presenting our case clearly and persuasively to influence policy decisions. Our arguments should be backed by solid data and personal testimonies that highlight the consequences of restricted medical choices. By maintaining a consistent presence in the media and online platforms, we can shape public opinion and create a strong, vocal demand for the protection of medical freedom. We call upon professionals from all fields—doctors, lawyers, educators, and business leaders—to lend their expertise and credibility to our cause. Their endorsement can significantly enhance our campaign’s legitimacy and impact. In unity, there is strength.

Currant bushes tied up for winter to prevent snow from breaking them down. sometimes most profitable to market the crop when the berries at the end of the bunches are still quite green. Varieties. There are not so many varieties of the currant offered in the nursery catalogues as of most other cultivated fruits, but still there is much difference in the size and quality of the different kinds, as well as in the hardiness and vigour of the plants. For the home garden, about one dozen plants well cared for will give an abundance of fruit.	In selecting varieties, one might consider the Red Dutch as a reliable and widely grown type. It boasts a medium to large berry that is both tart and sweet, making it ideal for both fresh consumption and culinary use. For those who prefer something a bit different, the White Imperial offers a milder flavor and a less pronounced tartness, making it excellent for eating fresh off the bush. For the more adventurous gardener, the Blackcurrant variety provides a distinctly stronger flavor, often described as 'musky' or 'earthy.' This variety is exceptionally high in vitamin C and is perfect for making preserves and liqueurs. When planting currants, it is important to consider their preferred growing conditions. These bushes thrive in a cool, moist climate and benefit from a location that offers some shade during the hottest part of the day. Soil should be well-draining but kept consistently moist. Organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, can be worked into the soil to improve its fertility and structure. Pruning is crucial to maintaining healthy currant bushes.

But land is scarce, the price of it is forbidding, and the large estates so general that individualism has quite generally Vol. CXXVII. — No. 762. — 118 gone down in defeat until necessity has at last forced a collectivism which is the very antithesis of the case of Denmark. Intended as a protection and in some cases actually exercised as such, the patronage which envelops the countryman has generally been outworn.	The old feudal bonds, while broken in law, linger in sentiment and in economic conditions, creating a dependency that stifles the spirit of enterprise so necessary for individual success. The small farmer, the peasant, finds himself caught in a web of traditional obligations and modern financial pressures that leave little room for the independence his forebears might have fought for. This situation has led to a growing discontent among the rural population, a ferment that may yet reshape the social and economic landscape. For where the land is monopolized by the few, and the many are left to struggle for their share, there can be no lasting peace or prosperity. The echoes of this struggle reach the cities too, where the displaced rural populace adds to the swelling ranks of the urban poor, creating further social strain. Thus, the necessity for land reform becomes apparent not only as a matter of justice but as a crucial step towards the stability and development of the nation as a whole. The redistribution of land, or at least a more equitable access to it, must be addressed if the cycle of poverty and dependence is to be broken. The	1913	1962.7443
"We were in a position to blow up the bridge at any moment ; but we wanted to ascertain if the enemy were prepared to do likewise. "" Minutes seemed like hours as we waited impatiently for the appointed moment. It was evident that Von Kronhelm feared to make further arrests, now that London was flooded by those red handbills. He would, no doubt, require all his troops to keep us in check! On entering London the enemy had believed the war  to be over, but the real struggle is only now commencing.  "" At last the low boom of a gun sounded from the direction of Westminster. We looked at our watches, and found that it was just ten o'clock."	"The signal had been given; it was the hour to act. With hearts racing, we moved swiftly but silently towards the control panel that would initiate the explosives. As we did, the distant sounds of chaos from the city reached our ears, a muddled cacophony of shouts and more gunfire. The enemy was indeed on high alert, their movements erratic and tense. Our fingers hovered over the switch, each of us exchanging a glance that conveyed both determination and the gravity of what we were about to do. This bridge was a vital artery for the enemy’s logistics and its destruction would cripple their advance, buying precious time for the resistance to regroup and mount a counteroffensive. Just as we were about to act, a sudden burst of light from the opposite bank caught our attention. Flares shot up into the night sky, painting everything in a stark, ghostly hue. It was clear now that the enemy had anticipated a move like ours and was prepared to counteract. ""We need to move now!"" I whispered urgently. Without hesitation, we pressed the switch.

IV. MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREGARIOUS ANIMAL. (a) Current Views in Sociology and Psychology. If we now assume that gregariousness may be regarded as a fundamental quality of man, it remains to discuss the effects we may expect it to have produced upon the structure of his mind. It would be well, however, first, to attempt to form some idea of how far investigation has already gone in this direction.	It is clear from the research of sociologists and psychologists alike that gregariousness not only influences individual behavior but also significantly molds the collective cognitive frameworks of societies. The consensus is that the human mind has developed certain mental characteristics specifically to facilitate living in groups. These include, but are not limited to, empathy, a propensity for learning through imitation, a tendency to conform to group norms, and the development of intricate forms of communication. Empathy, for instance, allows individuals within a group to understand and respond to the emotional states of others, promoting cohesive social interactions. This feature is seen as crucial for the survival of a species so heavily reliant on social structures. Similarly, the ability to learn behaviors by observing others is a trait that enhances the transmission of culture and knowledge across generations, ensuring that successful strategies for dealing with the environment are passed on. Conformity to group norms and the enforcement of these norms through various forms of social approval and disapproval are also seen as adaptations that serve to maintain group integrity and purpose. These norms can dictate everything from the types of food eaten, to the manner	1908	2007.1493
A great majority of thunderstorms over Continental North America and its adjacent waters result from a combination of causes; they occur at all hours but are more frequent during the afternoon than at any other time. THE PROBABILITY FACTOR. — The probability of having a thunderstorm within a fixed time at any particular spot, ie., an airport or a dock, depends on the total number of thunderstorms present in a fixed area and the rate at which they are travelling. Figure 67 is a map of the Lake  Michigan area on which are spotted 5 thunderstorms. Each storm covers an area of 10 square miles. To arrive at the probability of receiving a thunderstorm at the Yacht Club on the west shore of Lake Michigan between the hours of three and four in the afternoon the following procedure can be used. The total area containing 5 thunderstorms is 220,000 Figure 67. Typical thunderstorm distribution on hot summer afternoon.	First, determine the ratio of the area covered by the thunderstorms to the total area. Each storm covers 10 square miles, thus all five storms cover a total of 50 square miles. The total area under consideration is 220,000 square miles. Therefore, the percentage of the area covered by thunderstorms is (50 / 220,000) * 100, which equals approximately 0.0227%. Next, to calculate the probability that a thunderstorm will hit the Yacht Club during the specified hour, we must consider the movement and direction of the storms. Assuming the storms are moving towards the west shore and that they travel at a rate of 15 miles per hour, it is possible to estimate the likelihood of one reaching the Yacht Club. If the closest storm is currently 30 miles east of the Yacht Club, it would take about 2 hours for the storm to reach the club, placing it outside the 3-4 PM window. However, if any storms are within 15 miles and moving toward the club, they could potentially reach it within the	1913	1964.6451
"""They often waste more than they eat in finding food to their taste."" Their boldness is great, and they are not unfrequent visitors to the Botanic Gardens and Hyde Park, in the very centre of Sydney, where they refresh themselves on the ripe Moreton Bay figs. They have a peculiar musky odour, especially the northern kinds, and this odour serves as a guide to the camps. Another unpleasant peculiarity is that they are commonly infested with vermin, and indeed they are never known to take a bath. As there is so little in their favour, and the losses which they cause the fruit growers are so great, very little affection is felt for them. The blacks certainly will feed on the flesh, and Leichhardt states that he found it to be an excellent article of food when on his travels."	Nevertheless, the general consensus among settlers and farmers is markedly against these creatures. They are seen as pests rather than part of the natural fauna worth preserving or appreciating. Efforts to control their populations through hunting or other means are common, though not always successful, given the creatures' resilience and adaptability. Moreover, their rapid reproduction rates only exacerbate the problem, causing further complications for local agriculture and the balance of native ecosystems.  Despite their unpopularity, some naturalists and environmentalists argue for the need to understand and manage these populations with a more balanced approach. They suggest that these creatures, like all parts of an ecosystem, play a role in their environment, potentially aiding in the dispersal of seeds and maintaining the health of the forests in which they dwell. This perspective advocates for more research into their habits and ecological roles, proposing that a sustainable coexistence could be more beneficial than outright eradication. This debate continues as communities, farmers, and conservationists seek effective solutions to manage the impact on agricultural resources while considering environmental conservation.	1909	2006.2794
"Passing through Ferney, she found enough strength to act before Voltaire, and to rouse him to enthusiasm at the sound of his own verses. They talked of Garrick, and Clairon recounted how, at the date of her imprisonment, the English actor had made her a princely offer of assistance — 500 louis : "" Is there in all France a duke or a marshal generous and honourable enough to do as much?"" asked Voltaire of his friends But at the same moment we find her complaining of the irregularity of her London correspondent. Garrick makes use of the faithful Antonio passing that way with a new convoy of 1 Undated letter — June 1766 : Boaden, vol ii. p. 476. ' Boaden, vol."

Voltaire, ever the advocate for the oppressed and a great admirer of Garrick's talent, took it upon himself to write to the English actor. In his characteristic style, full of wit and underlying earnest, he expresses a mixture of reproach and appeal: ""Sir, the divine Clairon, who has illuminated our stages with her unparalleled talents, now finds herself in a plight most undeserving. Your noble intentions, I fear, have been thwarted by the caprices of fate or perhaps the negligence of intermediaries. Could I persuade you to renew your efforts to assist her?

The tribal lands are leased by the government, as administrator, and the rentals are paid over to the members of the tribe, each man, woman and child receiving from the United States government a dividend of over six hundred dollars a year. There are five million American workingmen who receive less than that for a year's hard labour. What if this continent, with its untold treasures, had been considered the common inheritance of the American people? What if the government had assumed the responsibility of administering these lands of the nation, leasing them to the biggest bidders, and dividing the proceeds equally, each year, among the men, women and children of the Republic ? Emphatically, one would not advise that. That would be reducing the people to the position of Indian wards. Every child of this Republic has, in sound morals, an inalienable inheritance in an equal share of the total unimproved value of the private and public land of the nation.	Yet, it is the duty of the government to manage it in such a way that it encourages self-reliance and industry, rather than dependence. The idea of a universal dividend might seem appealing as a form of social justice, redistributing wealth derived from natural resources that, in theory, belong to all. However, such a system could potentially stifle individual initiative and the economic drive that has historically been a cornerstone of American prosperity. Instead, a more balanced approach could involve the government using revenues from these lands to fund public services that empower individuals: education, healthcare, infrastructure, and perhaps even a form of conditional basic income that requires recipients to contribute to the community or engage in educational activities. This would not only help in elevating the living standards but also in creating a more skilled and motivated workforce. Moreover, the management of these lands must be transparent and accountable to prevent misuse and ensure that the benefits truly reach the public. The leasing process should be competitive and open, ensuring that no undue advantages are given to large corporations at the expense of smaller entities or the public good. In conclusion, while	1911	2005.8807
"""Zed"" Fuses. We have received from Messrs. Siemens Bros. Dynamo Works, Ltd. (39, ""Upper Thames Street, London, EGAN illustrated pamphlet describing some of the special features of "" ZED "" FUSES. Attention is directed to the risk of using bare wire fuses in which any size of wire can be inserted irrespective of the requirements of the particular circuit, and it is pointed out that this really affords no adequate protection. The convenience of the "" Zed"" fuse is emphasised, especially the clearness of the indication of a blown fuse and the simplicity of replacement, due to the use of distinctive colours for fuses of different capacities. A 10 Candle power Drawn wire Tungsten Lamp. Messrs. Siemens Bros. Dynamo Works, Ltd. (Tyssen Street, Dalston, London, NORTHEAST."	) have also introduced a new type of tungsten lamp, which is claimed to be a considerable advance over previous models. This new 10 candle power lamp is constructed with a specially drawn wire that enhances its durability and efficiency. The filament, being more finely drawn, offers less resistance and consequently, consumes less energy while providing a brighter and more stable light. The lamp's design also features an improved gas fill, which not only extends the life of the filament but also contributes to a more consistent light output throughout the lifespan of the lamp. This makes it particularly suitable for use in domestic settings where quality of light and energy efficiency are paramount. Furthermore, the new lamp is designed with a robust glass envelope that can withstand minor impacts and vibrations, making it ideal for use in areas where frequent movement or machinery operation might otherwise lead to frequent bulb replacements. This durability, combined with the energy efficiency and high-quality light output, positions this new tungsten lamp as a leading choice for both residential and commercial lighting applications.	1912	1993.4192

"Not that I ever occupied a Professorial Chair at a university or elsewhere, but it arose in this way : When John first came to live with me he felt a diffidence, owing to the disparity between our ages, in addressing me by my Christian name ; on the other hand, to call me by my surname seemed to him far too cold and formal. So on one occasion, when I had been holding forth on my favourite science, he remarked, "" I think, sir, if you will allow me, I shall call you ' Professor' in future; the title seems most appropriate for one who has the power of conveying information on scientific subjects in so clear and interesting a manner."" I was much amused at this proposal, but fully appreciating the difficulty he felt in the matter, replied, ""John, you really flatter me too much ; but as you seem to think the title fits, you may call me by it if you like."""	"Thus, the name stuck, and from that day forward, John always addressed me as ""Professor,"" a title which, though unofficial, lent a certain charm and humor to our interactions. It wasn't long before the name began to catch on within our circle of friends and acquaintances as well. They seemed to enjoy the slight formality and the nod to my penchant for detailed explanations on a range of topics, from the intricacies of botany to the complexities of mechanical engineering. In time, I found that the title of ""Professor"" not only shaped the way John saw me but subtly influenced my own behavior. I began to embrace the role with a gentle earnestness, diving even deeper into my studies and sharing my findings with greater enthusiasm. Our home became a small sanctuary of learning, with books stacked high and notes scattered about, each room a testament to a particular curiosity.

It ought to be a happy time which the child passes in the schoolroom, and to which he looks back with gratitude. But the great word which is to control it is not pleasure but duty. At some time in life, everybody must learn that no one can only follow his liking. Those to whom the community gives no chance to learn this lesson in the plastic years of school will have to learn it by disappointment and dissatisfaction at a later age. He who learned in the discipline of the school the eternal truth that the fulfilment of duty is the best thing which makes life worth living will be most grateful for his curriculum.	Such discipline prepares a child not only for the challenges of academic pursuits but also for the broader tests of character that life inevitably presents. The schoolroom, therefore, should not merely be a place of intellectual engagement but also a crucible for the shaping of moral fiber. It is here that the seeds of responsibility, perseverance, and integrity are sown—qualities that define the contours of a well-lived life. Indeed, the concept of duty extends beyond the mere completion of tasks; it encompasses a commitment to excellence, a respect for others, and a dedication to the common good. These are the principles that, when instilled at a young age, forge individuals capable of leadership and compassionate citizenship. Thus, while the joys of learning and the pleasures of discovery are vital, they must be balanced with a rigorous emphasis on the virtues of hard work and ethical behavior. It is through this balanced approach that education fulfills its highest purpose—not just informing the mind, but also forming the heart.	1909	1968.4766

It's pretty shaky, anyway.' "" The street was fairly full of people. The Germans, it is true, had ordered that no one should be out of doors between eight in the evening and six in the morning ; but just now they appeared to have their hands pretty full elsewhere, and if any of the few soldiers that were about knew of or thought anything of the interdiction, they said nothing. Wat Miller, the postman, came up and touched his cap. "" c Terrible times, sir, ' he said, ' ain't they ? There was a mort of people killed this afternoon by them shells."

Just then, a sharp whistle cut through the air, drawing everyone's attention to a small group of soldiers marching briskly towards them.

She passed the Hunter, and, placing herself astern of the Detroit, opened heavily upon the Lawrence, now, at a quarter past twelve, only musket - shot distance The Lookout from her chief antagonist. For two hours the frallant Perry and his devoted ship bore the brunt of the battle with twice his force, aided only by the schooners on his weather bow and some feeble shots from the distant Caledonia when she could spare them from her adversary the Hunter. During that tempest of war his vessel was terribly shattered. Her rigging was nearly all shot away; her sails were torn into shreds; her spars were battered into splinters; her guns were dismounted; and, like the Guerriere when disabled by the Constitution, she lay upon the waters! almost a helpless wreck. The carnage on her deck had been terrible. Out of one hundred and three sound men that composed her officers ami crew when she went into action, twenty-two were slain and sixty one were wounded.	The deck was slippery with blood, and strewn with splintered wood and debris. Amidst the chaos, Perry's resolve remained unbroken. With the Lawrence unable to continue the fight, he made a daring decision. Seizing the moment, he ordered a small boat to be lowered. Amidst a hail of enemy fire, he transferred his command, flag in hand, to the Niagara, which had been less engaged and was still seaworthy. As Perry departed the Lawrence, his men cheered him on, their spirits lifted by his indomitable courage. Reaching the Niagara, he quickly took command and steered her directly into the heart of the enemy line. With fresh vigor, the Niagara unleashed a furious broadside assault, her cannons roaring as they found their marks on the British ships. The tide of battle turned swiftly.

— When the stress across any given surface in a material is neither normal nor tangential to that surface, we may conveniently resolve it into rectangular components, normal to the surface and tangential to it. The normal stresses are tensile or compressive according to their directions, and the tangential components are shear stresses. A cel  p P 0/ B Fig. 4. A simple example will illustrate the method of resolution of stress. If a parallel bar of cross section a square inches be subjected to a pull p of P tonnes, the intensity of tensile stress / is - in the direction of the length of the bar, or, in other words, normal to a surface, AB (Fig. 4), perpendicular to the line of pull.	The formula for calculating this stress is given by \( f = \frac{P}{a} \), where \( P \) is the force applied and \( a \) is the area of the cross section. This will give us the stress in tonnes per square inch. Now, consider the bar also experiencing a shear force \( Q \) along the length of the bar at the same time as the tensile force. The shear stress \( \tau \) on any plane parallel to the direction of the shear force, such as plane CD in Figure 4, can be calculated using the formula \( \tau = \frac{Q}{a} \). It is important to note that while the tensile stress \( f \) acts perpendicular to the cross-sectional area \( AB \), the shear stress \( \tau \) acts parallel to it. In real-world applications, these stresses often occur simultaneously, and their combined effect must be considered to ensure the structural integrity of the material. For a complete analysis, one might also need to consider moments and other types of stresses depending on the complexity	1908	1985.8663

On page 464 of your last issue you quote Rabbi Ben Ezra excruciatingly amiss. "" Look not thou down, but up I To uses of a cup . ."	"The cup but mirrors earth, meanwhile thy soul, sublime, should burn with higher fire."" What Rabbi Ben Ezra implores is not a mere contemplation of the mundane, but a striving towards the celestial, the aspirational essence of human spirit. To reduce his exhortation to the mere utility of a cup is to strip it of its poetic and philosophical garment. Rabbi Ben Ezra, as crafted by Robert Browning, is a figure of profound wisdom, urging us to embrace the potential of our later years, to see in them not decline but the opportunity for spiritual ascent. He argues for a life lived with purpose and intensity, a life that continually reaches towards its highest potential until the very end. This is the essence that your quotation misses, and it is crucial for a true understanding of the poem. I urge you, Madam Editor, to revisit the text and consider its deeper resonances.

"But besides these two more common expressions there was found in a few cases ""the author"" or ""the printer""; and in nearly half a dozen instances ""the proprietor."" Many of the expressions erroneously put down as Americanisms have sprung from the belief that educated speech in this country is fairly represented by the farrago of words and phrases huddled together in the collections which the earlier compilers of these vocabularies put forth. Slight was the care originally exercised to separate what is peculiar to this country from what is universal in the English speaking world. This was even truer of the brief and scattered remarks upon these expressions which appeared in early British and American periodicals. Such, however, was hardly the case with the writer who first professedly devoted his attention to the subject, though even with him it was incidentally a part of the general discussion of usage. His name was John Witherspoon."	"Witherspoon, a Scottish-born American, was notable not only for his role as a signatory of the Declaration of Independence but also for his contributions to American English. In his essay ""On the Controversy Concerning Public Right,"" published in 1781, he meticulously examined various linguistic peculiarities he observed in American speech. Witherspoon's work was pioneering in that it differentiated between mere colloquialisms and words that were genuinely unique to American English. His approach was analytical and somewhat prescriptive, aiming to refine the American dialect so that it might be seen as equal in dignity to British English. Witherspoon argued that many so-called Americanisms were in fact legitimate derivatives of older English forms that had simply fallen out of common use in Britain. He also pointed out that some words considered Americanisms were actually preservations of these older forms and thus should not be dismissed as corruptions. His writings not only provided a defense against criticisms of American English but also set a scholarly foundation for future studies.

Industrial education and expert vocational counsel. Our public schools teach the common English branches, but as a rule give no definite instruction in the means of making a good living. Society is very shortsighted as yet in its attitude toward the development of its human resources. It trains its horses, as a rule, better than its men. It spends unlimited money to perfect the inanimate machinery of production, but pays very little attention to the business of perfecting the human machinery, though by far this is the most important factor in production.	This neglect is particularly striking when one considers the burgeoning complexities of modern industrial society. Every year, the demands of the workplace grow more intricate and specialized, requiring a workforce that is not only literate and numerate but also skilled in specific trades and technologies. Yet, our educational system lags woefully behind, structured more as a relic of a past era when a basic education was sufficient for finding employment. The need for a reformed educational paradigm is clear. Schools must evolve to offer programs that not only continue to teach fundamental academic subjects but also integrate vocational training that aligns with current and future job markets. This would include not just manual trades but also training in emerging fields like technology, healthcare, and green energy. Furthermore, the introduction of expert vocational counselors into schools could play a pivotal role. These professionals would help students understand their own aptitudes and interests and guide them towards educational pathways that lead to viable careers. This guidance would be particularly valuable in communities where children lack exposure to the variety of careers available to them, or where there is little tradition of continuing education beyond the compulsory levels.

After having provided Daisy with an expensive education which seems to have been no earthly use to her, the State permitted her to enter a laundry. By neglecting to inspect that laundry or to interfere when the owner paid Daisy a pittance of from five to ten shillings a week, the State tacitly consented to Daisy being brought to such a state of physical and mental starvation that any kind of emotion — even illicit and imprudent love — was a thing not to be resisted. Then when she was going to have a child, the State created such a strong feeling against her that the last drop of courage was squeezed out of a weakened body, and she dared not risk exposure by calling assistance during childbirth. So that, in a fit of delirium, she killed her baby. Then Mr. Bax wants the State to finish its beneficent ministrations to Daisy by hanging her. This is the limit.	To hang Daisy would be the final, irrevocable admission of the State's failure, not just in her case, but as an emblem of its treatment of countless others left vulnerable by systemic neglect and exploitation. If the State is indeed a guardian of its citizens, it must accept culpability for its part in her tragic trajectory. Instead of condemnation, what Daisy requires is rehabilitation and support—resources to heal from the psychological and physical scars inflicted by a society that has failed to protect her at every turn. It is imperative that we scrutinize not only this individual case but also the broader societal structures that allow such injustices to perpetuate. The State must reform its approach to social welfare, ensuring that all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable, are provided with viable opportunities and a livable wage. Additionally, there must be stringent oversight of all workplaces to safeguard against exploitative practices. Only through these measures can we hope to prevent future tragedies akin to Daisy’s and truly fulfill our moral obligations as a society.	1911	2007.6578

Why was Executive Order No. 1260 proclaimed to some of the public (certain entrymen on Controller Bay) some of the time (October 28, 1910, to April 20, 1911), and to all of the public after that time? A Significant Chronology 1903. Clarence Cunningham and his ""dummies"" filed on ""Cunningham Ridge"" coal claim in Alaska. November 1906."	President Theodore Roosevelt issued an Executive Order withdrawing coal lands in Alaska from entry pending legislation to address issues of monopoly and conservation. February 1908. The Alaska Coal Land Commission was established to investigate coal land claims and recommend a framework for management and disposal. July 1908. The Commission submitted its report, advising against large-scale monopolistic control and suggesting measures to ensure smaller, individual entries for development. March 1910. Congress passed the Alaska Coal Land Act, incorporating many of the Commission's recommendations, aiming to limit the size of claims and prevent monopolistic practices while promoting reasonable development. October 1910. Executive Order No. 1259 reinstated certain lands for entry under the new regulations, but with stringent oversight to prevent abuse. April 1911. All previously withdrawn lands were opened under the stipulations of the new coal land laws, ensuring a fair opportunity for all Americans in the development of Alaska's coal resources. This sequence of events underscores the ongoing governmental efforts to balance economic development with equitable resource management and conservation, reflecting a fundamental democratic principle of fairness and access for all.	1911	1987.901

For practical applications, especially in engineering design, it is essential to consider the factors of safety and the actual conditions under which the structure will operate. The approximation made in replacing the trigonometric function with an algebraic expression simplifies calculations significantly and allows for easier integration into design processes without compromising much on accuracy. Further, by manipulating these derived equations, one can predict the failure modes of struts or columns, which is crucial for ensuring the stability and integrity of structures. This predictive capability forms the basis for more advanced structural analysis methods, such as finite element analysis, which can handle complex geometries and material behaviors. Moreover, these foundational equations can be extended to account for different materials and cross-sectional shapes, thereby broadening their applicability across various fields of structural engineering. By understanding the underlying principles, engineers can adapt the equations to suit specific project requirements, whether they involve steel frameworks, reinforced concrete, or newer composite materials.

The alkaline salts when dry may be treated with a small excess of 20 percent sulphuric acid. Caproic and higher acids will then separate as an oil. The subjacent aqueous solution may be treated with salt, and butyric acid will then separate out from the salt solution also as an oil. And the salt solution shaken with aether will give up its lower acids to the aether. Silver calcium or barium salts of the several fractions of acids so obtained may be made, and from the amount of metal these salts contain the composition of the acids in each fraction determined.	This method allows for the separation and identification of the various fatty acids present in a mixture. Following the extraction and separation, the acids can be further purified and their structures confirmed through techniques such as gas chromatography or mass spectrometry. For instance, the silver salts of the fatty acids can be analyzed to determine their molecular weights and structural characteristics, providing insights into the nature of the acids. Further, by converting these acids into their methyl esters, more detailed analysis using gas chromatography can be performed, allowing for the identification of even minor components in the mixture. This process involves esterification of the acids followed by the separation of the esters on a chromatographic column, which can be tailored to separate fatty acids based on their chain length and degree of saturation. The utilization of these methods not only confirms the identity of the individual fatty acids but also quantifies their relative amounts, offering valuable data for both research and industrial applications. Thus, the initial separation using sulphuric acid and subsequent treatments form a fundamental part of the comprehensive analysis of fatty acids in various samples.	1913	2003.711

The integration is performed over the entire circumference of the ring or link, taking into account the distribution of stress and strain around the loop. This comprehensive approach allows for a more accurate prediction of the deformations under load, considering both bending and normal stresses. In practical applications, these theoretical insights can be used to design more efficient and resilient chain links and rings, which are fundamental components in various mechanical systems such as lifting equipment, vehicle tow chains, and maritime mooring systems. Moreover, understanding the interplay of forces and the resultant deformations can help in predicting failure modes and in establishing safer operational protocols. Furthermore, the validation of these theoretical predictions by experimental data not only strengthens the reliability of the mathematical models but also enhances the confidence in their practical applications. This close alignment between theory and experiment underscores the importance of integrated approaches in engineering design and analysis, where theoretical models are continually refined and validated through empirical data to ensure their accuracy and applicability in real-world scenarios.	1908	1994.4688

A beam of length / carries an evenly distributed load and rests on two supports. How far from the ends must the supports be placed if the greatest  I IO [CH. IV. STRENGTH OF MATERIALS. bending moment to which the beam is subjected is to be as small as possible ? Where are the points of contraflexure ? 10.	For a simply supported beam carrying a uniformly distributed load, the bending moment at the supports is zero because the reaction forces at the supports counteract the moments generated by the load. The maximum bending moment occurs at mid-span, where the bending moment is given by \( M = \frac{wL^2}{8} \), where \( w \) is the load per unit length and \( L \) is the span of the beam. To minimize the maximum bending moment in a beam supported at two points, the supports should be placed such that they create a condition of continuous beam over more than two supports. This can often be practically achieved by placing the supports at approximately \( \frac{L}{4} \) from each end of the beam. This placement results in a lower maximum bending moment compared to a simple beam with supports at the ends. The points of contraflexure, where the bending moment changes sign (from positive to negative or vice versa), occur in a uniformly loaded beam when it is supported in such a way that it has multiple spans (i.e., more than two	1908	1977.6486
Nor will he neglect the external and, as it may seem, fortuitous elements of history, the invasions of the eighth and ninth century which dissolved the mechanism of the Empire and threw political power and responsibility into the hands of the holders of military fiefs. the need for cavalry warfare which necessitated primogeniture; the slow growth of the royal power and the correspondingly jealous retention of what, for lack of a better name, may be called the feudal habit of society, a habit making for local and family autocracy, intense family pride and persistent hostility to the intrusionsof the royal jurisdiction. The extent to which the absence of state supported asylums for lunatics may have played a part in this curious chapter of history; the influence of Roman law; the diffusion of autocratic ideals from the Papacy and the Monarchy downwards, not to speak of a whole train of economic forces, would require most careful attention. We have a suspicion that in the end it would be found that in this, one of the most essential particulars of national life, the French are the most conservative people in Europe.	This conservatism, deeply rooted in the traditions and structures established during these formative centuries, would manifest itself in various ways across the social and political spectrum of France. It is seen not only in the persistence of feudal privileges and the slow evolution towards centralized authority but also in the enduring influence of the Catholic Church and the rigid stratifications of society. Even as the winds of change swept through Europe, bringing with them ideas of enlightenment and revolution, France's transformation was marked by a unique adherence to past forms and norms. Indeed, the French Revolution itself, while a dramatic upheaval, can be interpreted as a manifestation of this conservative impulse. The revolutionaries, in their radical break from the monarchy, paradoxically sought to return to an idealized version of the past, a 'natural order' where liberty, equality, and fraternity were supposedly enshrined. This is not to say that they aimed to restore feudalism, but rather that their vision was informed by a deep-seated respect for the continuity of the nation's historical identity, even as they sought to redefine it. Furthermore, the restoration of the	1908	1995.8004
"""The term 'liberal Marxian Socialist, '"" says Mr. Spargo, ""is fairly accurate as a description  Books of the Day 575 of the author's attitude toward Marx and the Socialist movement. He believes that the teachings of Marx, interpreted in a liberal spirit, such as Marx himself would approve, rather than in the narrow, dogmatic spirit which Marx condemned, constitute the best basis for successful Socialist agitation and policy. ""There are today in the Socialist movement, as there were in the lifetime of Marx, those who would interpret Marx's teachings in such a narrow and dogmatic manner as to prevent the progress of the movement beyond the limits of a sect wedded to a dogma. That they are false to the spirit of Marx himself is the burden of the three lectures here published."" We can heartily recommend the volume to all persons interested in the subject of Socialism. Man's Tomorrow. By William W. Kinsley."	"Published by Harrow and Brothers, New York. Price $1.50. In ""Man's Tomorrow,"" William W. Kinsley presents a thought-provoking exploration of potential future societies shaped by the ideals of socialism and the practical applications of Marxian theories. Kinsley, much like the author discussed by Mr. Spargo, adopts a liberal interpretation of Marx, arguing that rigid adherence to dogma can stifle innovation and the broader applicability of socialist principles. Through a series of essays, Kinsley critiques contemporary societal structures while proposing alternatives that emphasize collective welfare, economic equity, and sustainable development. He delves into topics such as the redistribution of wealth, the role of technology in a socialist future, and the potential for global cooperation to address pressing issues like climate change and social inequality. Kinsley's writing is both accessible and intellectually rigorous, making ""Man's Tomorrow"" an essential read for both seasoned scholars of political theory and newcomers to the discourse on socialism.

"I do not propose to enter into a detailed comparison of Shakespeare and Christ. I assert in all brevity that their deepest sentiments were substantially the same. It is a matter of intuition. Anyone who knows his Shakespeare and his New Testament — anyone, that is to say, with the necessary music in himself — is bound to come to the same conclusion. Besides, Frank Harris mentions it in his monumental "" Women of Shakespeare, "" and Frank Harris' word on the subject is spiritual law. No one will deny that women in general have always found a personal affinity in the figure of Christ — least of all the unsympathetical, unmusical man. It is one of his most constant and most typical sneers."	Yet, to truly appreciate the parallelism between Shakespeare and Christ, one must look beyond the superficial and delve into the essence of their teachings and portrayals of the human spirit. Both figures, in their respective realms, explored the depths of human emotions, the complexity of relationships, and the eternal quest for understanding and redemption. Shakespeare, through his myriad characters and intricate plots, encapsulated the full spectrum of human experience, from the basest desires to the noblest sacrifices. Christ, in His teachings and parables, addressed the human condition with profound compassion and offered a path to transcendence through love and forgiveness. The resonance of their messages across centuries underscores a universal truth about the enduring quest for meaning and connection in human life. Both taught about the power of love, the importance of forgiveness, and the possibility of redemption, thereby affirming the intrinsic worth and potential of every individual. This deep-seated alignment in their core messages perhaps explains the intuitive link that some discern between Shakespeare's literary genius and Christ's spiritual insight. Thus, while the comparison may initially seem far-fetched or irreverent to	1911	1992.4332
This place they held during two centuries or more; only with modern romanticism and realism have they been retired from duty. As a striking example of the immense influence that Ronsard exerted, we find Boileau, in spite of all his disdain for his predecessor, recommending in the Art Poctique the use of gods and goddesses as convenient literary devices and adornments, as follows: Ainsi, dans cet amas de nobles fictions, Le poet s'egaye en mille inventions, Orne, Sldve, embellit, agrandit toutes choses, lit trouve sous sa main des fleurs toujours ecloses. Boileau, however, almost entirely lacked the spirit that animated Ronsard. If Boileau used mythology, it was only /  616 that he might be in fashion; at heart he considered it nothing but a cold and lifeless allegory. Ronsard, on the contrary, made of his classics an imaginative faith.	He breathed life into the ancient myths, making them vibrant and relevant to the sensibilities of his time. His poems were not merely decorative or superficially embellished with mythical references; they were deeply infused with the essence and spirit of classical mythology, which he wielded as a powerful tool for exploring human emotions and experiences. Ronsard's approach to mythology was dynamic and inventive, allowing him to connect with his audience on a profound level, transcending mere literary tradition. In contrast, Boileau's engagement with mythology can be seen as somewhat mechanical and utilitarian, employed more as a formalistic element of style rather than as a means of genuine artistic expression. This difference in their use of mythology underscores a broader divergence in their poetic philosophies: where Ronsard saw poetry as a living art, rich with potential for innovation and emotional depth, Boileau adhered more rigidly to classical forms and rules, prioritizing order and reason over the imaginative freedom cherished by Ronsard. Thus, while Boileau might have recognized the utility of mythological elements as a staple of classical poetic	1911	2007.5233
Faith is not a mere matter of feeling. It is the acceptance of truth, positive, unchanging, revealed truth, in regard to God and the world, Christ and the soul, duty and immortality. The first appeal to faith lies in the clearness and vividness, the simplicity and joy, with which this truth is presented. There has not been too much preaching of doctrine in this age — there has been too little. And what there has been, has been too dull and cold and formal, too vague and misty, too wavering and uncertain. What the world wants and waits for today is a strong, true, vital preaching of doctrine. The Church must realise anew the precious value of the truths which Christ has given her. She must not conceal them or cast them away; she must bring them out into the light, press them home upon the minds and hearts of men. She must simplify her statement of them, so that men can understand what they mean.	She must make them vivid, so that men can feel their power. She must make them practical, so that men can apply them to their lives. This is the true mission of the Church, to be a beacon of truth in a world often shrouded in confusion and despair. The doctrines of faith should not be treated as mere intellectual exercises or theological puzzles to be solved. They are living truths, meant to transform lives and guide souls towards righteousness and peace. Indeed, the substance of faith is not merely to believe in something because it is written or spoken, but because it has been experienced and lived. The teachings of Christ are not just historical accounts; they are pathways to a deeper understanding of our existence and our purpose. They are the foundations upon which we build our moral and spiritual lives, and from which we draw strength in times of trial. Thus, the Church must strive to communicate these truths with renewed passion and conviction. It must engage not only the minds but also the hearts of the faithful, encouraging them to live out these truths in their daily lives. It is through such active and	1908	1907.1285
Looking over the world at large, and throughout all time, we see that the results of racial intermarriage have been exceedingly variable. Sometimes it has produced a better race. This is especially true when the crossing has been between different but closely allied stocks. The Englishman who has resulted from the commingling of so many Teutonic tribes with the native Briton and Celt, and the composite moulded and directed by Roman culture, is perhaps the very best example of a good result from extensive crossing. Likewise the cross which has taken place in Ecuador, Mexico and Peru has produced a race not altogether hopeless so far as the future is concerned; for, however much it may have hurt the Spaniard, it certainly has improved the Indian immeasurably. It is not so much a question of the possibility of producing a vigorous cross race under favourable conditions, as it is a question of whether such a cross is, in itself, a desirable thing.	For while in some cases the blending of races has led to a strengthening of certain desirable traits, in others it has resulted in a dilution or even a loss of cultural identity and heritage, which some might argue is too great a cost. Historical examples abound where the merging of distinct peoples has led to conflict and strife rather than harmony and progress. The complexities of such unions are manifold, involving not only biological but also sociocultural factors. Moreover, the success of racial intermarriage often hinges on the societal context in which it occurs. Societies that are open and accepting of diversity tend to facilitate better integration and mutual enrichment among different racial groups. Conversely, in contexts where racial prejudice and discrimination prevail, the outcomes of such intermixing can be less positive, leading to social marginalization and perpetuating cycles of inequality. Thus, the question of whether racial intermarriage is desirable cannot be answered in a straightforward manner. It requires a nuanced understanding of the specific historical, cultural, and social dynamics at play. It calls for a consideration not only of the biological or genetic outcomes but also of the	1911	1998.8485

Their role is not only to lead in rituals but also to settle disputes, manage communal resources, and maintain the laws of the land. These leaders are often regarded as the custodians of the tribe's traditions and spiritual well-being. The sanctity of their role is underscored by various taboos and rituals that reinforce their authority. For instance, it is common for these headmen to undergo rigorous initiation ceremonies that symbolize their transition from ordinary members of the society to their esteemed positions. During these ceremonies, they might be isolated from the rest of the community, undergo fasting, and receive sacred knowledge from the elders. Moreover, their physical well-being is often linked with the prosperity of the community. In some cultures, if a headman falls ill, it is seen as an omen of impending misfortune for the tribe. Consequently, their health and safety are often the subjects of communal concern and care. In their governance, they employ a mix of autocracy and consensus. While they hold the final say in many matters, they	1908	1975.6959
"First might' be mentioned the significance to the young learner of testing by a muscular manipulation the objects of his environment. Such objects are of value as educational materials to the degree to which they call for necessary muscular adjustments similar to those which the race from the earliest times has experienced. Every sensation or thought, the psychologists affirm, naturally stimulates a motor adjustment which reinforces the original sensory or central impulse which originated the motion. And this ""back stroke"" from the muscle furnishing the unifying ""kinesthetic factor"" is a thing to be encouraged and not repressed, as has too often been done in school work In the earliest ward in the most deliberate and amplest fashion to the study of the products of the intellectual life, regardless of the basis of his own economic support."" — Butler, ""Training for Vocation and for Avocation, "" Educational Review, December, 1908, pp. 472-474. """"We have lately become convinced that accurate work with carpenter's tools, or lathe, or hammer and anvil, or violin, or piano, or pencil, or crayon, or camel's hair brush, trains the same nerves and ganglia with which we do what is ordinarily called thinking."""	In light of this, it becomes imperative to reconsider the traditional educational frameworks that have long favored cerebral activities disconnected from physical engagement. The integration of the hand and mind is not merely a pedagogical preference but a biological necessity. As pointed out by Dr. Montessori in her methods, the child develops cognitively through direct interaction with their environment, facilitated by movement and exploration. Education systems must embrace this holistic approach, recognizing that the development of motor skills, sensory experiences, and cognitive functions are deeply interconnected. It is through such activities as sculpting in clay, assembling mechanisms, or even the rhythmic movements in dance, that students not only learn about the world but also how to think about it critically and creatively. Indeed, the synthesis of kinesthetic learning with traditional academic subjects can lead to a richer, more comprehensive educational experience. For instance, a mathematics lesson on geometry becomes more impactful when students can physically manipulate shapes, seeing and feeling the concepts of symmetry, area, and volume. Similarly, a history lesson on ancient engineering feats like the Roman aqueducts becomes more tangible when students can	1911	2007.4462

Mr. Rose says of it: "" I cannot find that it burrows; it finds its way under logs and pieces of bark, lying very close but not appearing to have made any attempt at excavation."" Limnodynastes poronii. L. tasmaniensis. An attractive little species, with rather flattened body, about 40 mm. long when adult, though Mr. Fletcher has met with specimens nearly 25 mm. longer, with limbs and digits moderately developed, rather adapted to an amphibian life among swamps than a powerful swimmer in open water."	The coloration of L. tasmaniensis is particularly striking, featuring a combination of dull greens and browns with darker, irregular blotches that provide excellent camouflage in its natural habitat. The underbelly is generally lighter, ranging from cream to a pale yellow, providing a sharp contrast to the darker dorsal colors. This species is also noted for its distinctive call, a deep and resonant croak that is most commonly heard during the breeding season, typically after heavy rains. L. tasmaniensis is primarily nocturnal, spending most of the daylight hours hidden beneath leaf litter, in dense reeds, or amongst the roots of trees. Diet consists mainly of small invertebrates, including insects and their larvae, which it captures using its quick, sticky tongue. Breeding occurs in temporary pools formed by rainwater, where males call to attract females. The female lays her eggs in floating foam nests that she constructs by beating a secretion from her body into a frothy mass with her hind legs. These nests help to protect the eggs from predation and desiccation, ensuring a higher survival rate	1909	2005.6719

These cases illustrate the complexities of legal disputes regarding various contractual and tort issues that arise across different jurisdictions. In each instance, the courts have been tasked with interpreting the statutes and common law principles pertinent to the specific circumstances presented, ensuring that justice is administered according to the laws and precedents that bind them. For instance, in Enright v. California, the court had to determine the liability in a case involving property damage caused by negligence. Similarly, in Campbell v. Russell, the issue centered around the enforceability of a contract under duress. Each case provides a unique insight into the legal landscape of the time, reflecting the ongoing evolution of law in response to changing societal norms and expectations. The citation of these cases not only serves as a reference for legal professionals but also aids in the understanding of how legal principles are applied in practical scenarios. As such, they form a crucial part of legal education and practice, continually influencing the development of law in the United States.	1913	1993.5541
Furthermore, by analysing samples of the air current before and after its passage through the chamber containing the animal the gaseous waste products given off by the latter are determined. Finally, energy escapes from the animal in the form of heat. In the German experiments the amount of heat produced by the animal is virtually computed from the amount and kind of materials oxidised in the body. This may also be done in the experiments with the respiration calorimeter, but in addition this apparatus is provided with appliances for the direct determination of the heat given off, it being taken up by a current of cold water circulating through copper pipes and its amount measured with the aid of sensitive thermometers.	The accuracy of these measurements is critical, as the balance of energy input and output is essential for understanding metabolic rates and efficiencies. The calorimeter chamber is meticulously sealed to ensure that no heat escapes except through the designated pathways, where it can be quantified. The water flowing through the copper pipes absorbs the heat, and the rise in water temperature as it exits the chamber provides a direct measure of the heat energy lost by the animal. This method, combined with the analysis of respiratory gases, allows researchers to construct a detailed energy budget for the subject under study. Moreover, these experiments help in exploring the basal metabolic rate of the animal, which is the amount of energy per unit time that it needs to maintain its physiological functions in a resting state. This data is crucial not only for biological and veterinary sciences but also has applications in ecology, as it helps in understanding the energy dynamics in various ecosystems. By integrating the data from the calorimeter with observations of food intake and activity levels, scientists can gain insights into how animals adapt their metabolism to different environmental conditions. This holistic approach is essential for advancing our understanding of	1911	1985.711
"The reversals were at the rate of 800 cycles per minute, and the ratio of tensile to compressive stress varied from 1-4 to 072 (J to f) with two intermediate (reciprocal) proportions. The inquiry also included the relative limiting resistance to fracture under reversed stresses of material in various forms, some of which had rather abrupt changes of section, such as in screw threads, etc. Perhaps the most surprising result of these experiments was that the values obtained for the limiting ranges of stress agreed, so far as it was possible to compare the materials used, with those of Wohler and Bauschinger made at about 60 cycles per minute rather than with those 1 "" On the Resistance of Iron and Steel to Reversalsof Direct Stress, "" Proc. Inst. CE., 1906, vol. clxvi. p. 78."	Moreover, it was observed that the presence of notches or sharp changes in cross-sectional area significantly impacted the endurance limit of the materials tested. These findings underscored the critical importance of considering geometrical discontinuities in the design of components subjected to cyclic loading. The experiments further demonstrated that the microstructure of the material plays a crucial role in its fatigue behavior. Materials with finer grains showed improved resistance to fatigue, likely due to their ability to distribute stress more evenly across the microstructure. Additionally, the surface finish of the materials was found to have a profound effect on their fatigue strength. Smoother surfaces exhibited higher resistance to crack initiation and propagation, emphasizing the need for precise machining and finishing techniques in the manufacturing of fatigue-critical components. This aspect of the research highlighted the interplay between material science and manufacturing processes in determining the overall performance of engineering materials under dynamic loads. The comprehensive study not only provided valuable insights into the behavior of materials under reversed stresses but also laid the groundwork for future investigations into fatigue-resistant materials and design optimization strategies. As such, these findings are expected to have significant implications for	1908	2002.5763
He was sure that they had all appreciated the care and attention which Mr. Goodenough had given to the Society in his capacity as Chairman, and this appreciation was. perhaps, even greater on the part of the members of the Council, who had a closer opportunity of judging the skill which he had devoted to the affairs of the Society. MR. LEON GASTER then alluded to his coming visit to the United States. Correspondence had passed with the Illuminating Engineering Society of America, and on more than one occasion a desire for closer cooperation had been expressed on both sides of the Atlantic. Circumstances had hitherto prevented his making a personal visit, but the great privilege and pleasing duty had now fallen to him of going to the States, carrying with him a message of goodwill from this Society. He felt sure they all recognised the unique pioneering work which the American Society had accomplished.	"The advancements they had made in the field of illuminating engineering were not only commendable but were setting standards globally. Their contributions to the development of lighting technologies, their rigorous standards for lighting design, and their commitment to education and research were all aspects that we, as a Society, aspire to emulate and perhaps even collaborate on in the future. MR. LEON GASTER continued, ""It is my hope that this visit will mark the beginning of a fruitful exchange of ideas and innovations between our two societies. We are on the brink of new developments in lighting technology that promise to revolutionize the way we think about energy efficiency, ecological impacts, and aesthetic outcomes in illumination. The potential for joint research initiatives and shared learning opportunities is immense."" He paused, looking around the room at the faces of his colleagues, all keenly attentive. ""I will be discussing potential collaborative projects with our American counterparts, focusing on areas where our goals align and where our combined efforts could lead to significant advancements. This includes, but is not limited to, sustainable lighting solutions, human-centric lighting, and smart lighting systems that integrate"	1912	2003.5033
"""Harrh!"" said Old Vitriol. He opened the box, and there was the dagger in it, with the blade rusted. ""Yes, yes, "" said Simeon. The men stared at Old Vitriol with constraint, with half concealed tremors of laughter. They kicked their lumpish feet about, not thinking it safe to say the slightest word. They knew that this was only one of the many devices of that relentless old lady to force upon Old Vitriol all the consequences of his great mistake. ""I am going to buy that box, Simeon, "" he said, setting it down and reaching into his pocket. This was his counter move.

"Old Vitriol nodded curtly, pulled out a crisp note, and slapped it down on the table with a force that made the coins nearby jump. ""Keep the change,"" he grunted, his eyes never leaving the rusted dagger as he snapped the box shut with a sharp click. Simeon, sensing the tension thick as fog, hurriedly scooped up the money, mumbling a thanks that got lost in his throat. As Old Vitriol turned to leave, the men exchanged glances, their earlier mirth cooled by the raw edge in the air. They watched him walk away, the box under his arm like a captured enemy flag. They knew better than to laugh now, aware that the old man's pride was a shield as formidable as any armor. Once outside, Old Vitriol allowed himself a deep breath.

"""There be thoughts, "" wrote F. W. Maitland, ""which only come to men when they are tightly packed; "" and the psychology of the Stock Exchange still awaits its Walter Bagehot. Valuable results may no doubt be obtained in any one of these branches of inquiry without a profound study of Wundt or Munsterberg or William James; but some working hypotheses there must be, and the more thoroughly these hypotheses are tested by observation, the more valuable the results. Brilliant examples of the application of common-sense psychology to the field of social inquiry may be cited. There is Walter Bagehot's English Constitution, Tarde's Lois de imitation, Mrs. Bosanquet's Rich and Poor. It is, perhaps, the most important service of the novel that, exploring as it does the infinite combinations of psychological casuistry, it tends to educate a curiosity in human character as such and to exhibit the psychological forces which work in society."	In this way, the novel acts not merely as a mirror reflecting societal norms and deviations thereof, but as a prism, refracting the varied psychological motives and responses that underlie human actions. Through the artful construction of narrative and character, novelists like George Eliot or Dostoevsky delve deep into the psyche, revealing not only what characters do but why they might do it, thereby enriching the reader's understanding of human behavior. This is not to say that all novels achieve this depth; many cater to simple entertainment without much psychological insight. However, those that do probe the complexities of the human mind offer a rich field for the kind of observational psychology that can complement more systematic studies in the field. Moreover, the detailed psychological portrayals found in some literary works can serve as case studies that are as revealing as any experiment. They provide scenarios and outcomes that can be analyzed for their psychological content, offering insights into motives, conflicts, and resolutions that are played out within the narrative structure. Thus, the study of literature can be a valuable adjunct to the study of psychology, providing a	1908	2004.1918
"Nor does it matter really, if ""one has brought it all on one's self ""; indeed, all the more should we see how much does this but add to his distress, and how much does it have to do in prolonging and deepening this indefinitely; indeed, until it may most unexpectedly result in such permanent registerings, as may quite absolutely unfit him for any further useful accomplishment in life. For, first and last and all the time, it must be remembered that the outcome of psychalgia, unless acting upon exceptional constitutions, is unfitness for even the commonplaces of life."	Thus, the burden of self-inflicted woes weighs heavily not only on the spirit but also on the ability to perform and thrive in daily affairs. It is a tragic irony that the very actions one might undertake to alleviate one's distress or escape from reality, such as indulgence in narcotics or persistent avoidance of responsibility, often lead to deeper entanglements and more profound suffering. The psyche, burdened and bruised, struggles to maintain its equilibrium and functionality. This cycle of suffering and dysfunction can be particularly insidious because it reinforces itself—each failure or retreat further diminishing the sufferer's confidence and resilience. Moreover, the social repercussions of such a state cannot be overstated. Relationships suffer as those around the afflicted struggle to understand or grow weary of supporting someone seemingly bent on self-destruction. Employment and opportunities diminish as reliability wanes and potential goes unfulfilled. Thus, the individual, already grappling with internal demons, finds the external world increasingly inhospitable, which in turn exacerbates the internal turmoil. In addressing such conditions, it is imperative to recognize the need for compassionate intervention. It	1911	2002.9708
Pitiable is the community which does not respect the educators of the youth sufficiently to allow them a material life which keeps them free from wants and pressure. But if this is secured, the teacher should be the last to complain that his life lacks reward and satisfaction. His place in the community is one of dignity, his daily work gives him the joy of the contact with open minded youth whose gratitude will accompany him through life. He spreads truth, he kindles enthusiasm he serves no arbitrary master but  319   the ideals of his heart. In this light it is, indeed, a sad experience to see the disappearance of men from the schoolteacher's career. The statistics report that in 1880 forty three percent of the teachers in the public schools of the whole country were men, in 1890 thirty-five percent, in 1900 thirty percent, in 1907 twenty-two percent.	This decline is not merely a numerical issue but also a cultural one, reflecting perhaps broader societal shifts about the roles and values of genders in various professions. The reasons for this change are manifold and complex. Economic factors play a significant role; often, the salaries offered by educational institutions do not compete well with those in the corporate or technical sectors, which are more traditionally male-dominated. Additionally, there is a societal perception, albeit an outdated one, that teaching is an extension of nurturing, which is stereotypically associated with women. The impact of this trend extends beyond the teachers themselves to the students they educate. The presence of male teachers in schools provides a diverse role model for students, showing that intellectual and nurturing roles are not confined to one gender. It also helps in disciplining and mentoring, particularly for boys who might lack male figures in other areas of their lives. Moreover, the diversity of teacher gender in schools contributes to a balanced educational environment, promoting equality and reducing gender stereotypes among young learners. It is crucial, therefore, that efforts be made to address this imbalance. Potential solutions could include better pay	1909	2005.3479
The larger ones were placed on platform scales, where they were allowed to remain undisturbed. The majority, however, were mounted and two or three men were necessary to handle them in the weighings which were made at intervals correlated with the season and the rate of loss. All individuals showed a high rate of loss when first taken from the soil, the excess being attributed to the evaporation from abraded surfaces of the roots and stems. Next it was found, of course, that the rate of loss was least during the cooler season, at which time an Echinocactus might lose as little as one forty thousandth of its weight in a day, and on the other hand during many days in the hot dry season the daily loss was one three hundredth of its total weight. The minimum of the tree cactus was one nine thousandth of its total and the maximum was about that of the Echinocactus, although not measured under equivalent conditions. Chief interest in the rate of loss, however, centres about the behaviour of these plants from season to season, especially when the amount of water on hand was taken into account.	It was observed that fluctuations in the daily weight loss were significantly influenced by the available moisture content in the environment. During prolonged dry spells, the cacti exhibited increased rates of weight loss, a survival mechanism allowing them to reduce their overall size and thus conserve vital moisture reserves. Conversely, following rare but substantial rainfall events, the rate of weight loss would notably decrease as the plants absorbed and retained water. Further studies revealed that the physiological adaptations of these cacti extend beyond mere weight fluctuation. Their ability to adjust metabolic rates in response to hydration levels was remarkable. For example, during periods of adequate water availability, metabolic activities, such as photosynthesis and growth processes, increased. This was evident from the enhanced green coloration and noticeable growth spurts in both stem and root systems. Moreover, the epidermal structure of these cacti plays a crucial role in their moisture preservation. The thick, waxy cuticle and densely packed spines significantly reduce water loss by shielding the stomata (the tiny pores used for gas exchange) from direct sunlight and wind, thereby slowing the process of trans	1911	2002.3992
But before we make up our minds how to steer from day today, we must know where we are going in the long run. Then we can shape our course to fit our purpose. We can learn how to meet emergencies as they arise. We can change our direction to avoid obstacles and dangers. We can take a roundabout way if need be.	Indeed, it is the foresight of our ultimate destination that lends coherence to our immediate choices, tying together the seemingly disparate decisions into a unified strategy. As mariners of old would set their compass by the stars, so too must we set our life’s course by the fixed points of our long-term goals. This does not mean that our path will be free of adjustments or recalibrations; the sea is ever-changing, and so is life. Flexibility, then, becomes an indispensable companion to foresight. To navigate successfully, one must be as adept at altering course as at setting it. This duality of steadfastness and adaptability allows us to harness the winds of circumstance to propel us forward, rather than be buffeted aimlessly by them. Thus, equipped with a clear vision of our destination and a readiness to adapt, we can journey through life’s complexities with confidence and purpose, turning challenges into stepping stones towards our ultimate aims.	1908	1988.1003
Those with the staffs of prominent investigators, where there are many curators and all active in research. It is just the same with universities; international reputation is not based on buildings and number of students, but upon the number of original thinkers who publish. A dictionary is a museum of words, but it has no particular use until some one comes along and uses these words for a writing that people will read. Very frequently a museum expends a sum for a single specimen or for a collecting expedition, sufficient to maintain several good men for a year. Often again it has a chance to secure an investigator, and hesitates because the expenditure would have to be drawn from some library or janitorial fund. Too often it is apt to consider the exhibition series to be its main purpose, and to regard men valuable only as arrangers of the exhibition. The saddest trait of all is self complacence, satisfaction in conditions as they are for this marks decay.	The true purpose of a museum, much like that of a university, should be the advancement and dissemination of knowledge. It is not merely a repository of objects or a gallery where the public can gaze upon the wonders of the past and present. Rather, it should be an active, living institution where research is vigorously pursued, where knowledge is expanded, and where the public is not only educated but also inspired. This requires investment in human resources—scholars, researchers, and educators who can breathe life into the collections, interpret them in meaningful ways, and connect them to contemporary issues and ideas. It demands a dynamic approach to exhibitions, which should not only display artifacts but also tell stories, pose questions, and engage audiences in dialogue. Furthermore, a museum must look outward as much as it looks inward. Collaborations with other institutions and communities, both local and international, can enhance its research capabilities and its educational reach. Public programs, workshops, lectures, and interactive sessions can transform it from an isolated hall of artifacts into a vibrant center of learning and cultural exchange. In summary, a museum must be more	1911	1994.2097

"When such distinctive endings as this exist, transition is limited. When they do not exist, the transference of a word from one part of speech to another is largely at the discretion of the individual. Take, for instance, the reduplicated interjection pooh pooh. It may be and has been used both as a noun and as a verb. "" I go on perhapsing "" is a phrase found  134 in Disracli's novel The Young Duke. Examples like these could be multiplied almost endlessly. Still, while this transition is possible in the case of other parts of speech, it is in the interchange of noun and verb that it occurs on the most extensive scale. Especially is this true of the passage of the former into the latter. Most of these common transitions are duly recorded in dictionaries."	"The fluidity of English allows for such flexibility, where words can shift categories, adapting to the needs of expression and communication. This linguistic phenomenon, often referred to as ""conversion"" or ""zero derivation,"" enriches the language, providing speakers with a vast array of expressive possibilities. For example, the word ""butter"" is predominantly known as a noun, but it can easily be used as a verb when one spreads butter on bread. Similarly, ""to shoulder"" one’s way through a crowd transforms the noun ""shoulder"" into a verb. This flexibility is not merely a modern linguistic trend but has roots deep in the history of the English language. Old English, for instance, already exhibited such conversions, though perhaps not with the same frequency or ease as seen today. The process by which these changes occur is generally natural and often goes unnoticed by the everyday speaker, which is a testament to the intuitive nature of language evolution. Linguists study these transitions to understand better how language functions and evolves over time. They analyze whether certain conditions or environments stimulate this kind of linguistic flexibility more than others"	1913	2007.0339
Every observer who takes upon himself to speak of social growths, of political claims, of industrial changes, is conscious that such matters are of little or no account unless they can be directly related to the needs of a population living permanently on the bare subsistence level. semi official estimates of Indian poverty are often quoted. According to one of the most familiar of these, a total of not less than 100 millions are living in a condition of hopeless poverty — a poverty which would have to be represented by a deeper black than Mr. Charles Booth or the recent inquirers in West Ham have had any occasion to use. For us, as the ruling race, the basic question is whether under our system the lot of the Indian peasant and labourer is, or is not, more abject than it was under Asiatic rule. That question still requires to be answered scientifically. Most of  the answers available are of a strongly controversial character.	The complexity of the issue is heightened by the variety of regional contexts within India itself—each with its unique historical, cultural, and economic backgrounds. Consequently, any sweeping generalization tends to oversimplify the nuances and leads to polarized debates among scholars and policymakers. Moreover, the methodologies employed in such assessments are critically important. Historical data under Asiatic rule is sparse and often not directly comparable to the more systematically collected data of the British administration. Furthermore, the impact of British policies on agriculture, taxation, and land tenure systems has varied significantly across different regions of India. In some areas, the introduction of cash crops favored by colonial trade demands led to economic growth and improved infrastructure. In others, it resulted in displacement of food crops, leading to famine and increased vulnerability among the peasantry. Thus, a scientific approach to this question would require a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary study incorporating economic analysis, historical context, regional variations, and perhaps most importantly, the voices of the Indian people themselves through qualitative research. Only then can we begin to understand the full impact of British rule compared to the Asiatic regimes that	1908	2005.7245

He continued his observations, meticulously recording each detail of the Martian surface as he perceived it through his telescope. Despite the skepticism of his peers, he remained undeterred, convinced of the accuracy of his findings. His focus was unyielding, his dedication to his studies unwavering. Each night, as the stars emerged and Mars ascended the sky, he was there at his telescope, charting and sketching. The controversy surrounding his observations only fueled his resolve. He began to correlate his findings with those of other astronomers, seeking patterns and consistencies that might validate his claims. Over time, he compiled a comprehensive map of Mars, detailing not only the canals and oases but also noting variations in color and texture that suggested different geological formations. His work, once criticized and doubted, gradually began to gain a small but growing acknowledgment among the scientific community. Discussions shifted from outright dismissal to cautious intrigue as more astronomers began to observe and report similar features on the Martian surface. The debate continued, but it was now tempered with a sense of possibility, a recognition that there might indeed be more	1911	1993.715
"""Those who make haste to be rich pierce themselves through with many sorrows."" That dream city of porphyry and alabaster, of ebony and cedar, of silver and gold and ivory, cost Spain alone more lives than all her other conquests in the Western Hemisphere. 514 However, there were compensations, and those of no mean order, for before long the accumulated wealth of the Incas, the vast riches of the Andean mines, the treasures of Los Teques and Barota and Potosi came pouring in a golden flood down to the Caribbean shore, and Caracas and La Guayra, Porto Bello, and Cartagena sprang suddenly into being, the latter destined to outstrip all of the others in wealth and romance. Founded in 1533, Cartagena began almost at once to contribute to the romantic history of the world."	It became a principal port for the Spanish treasure fleets, and a coveted prize for pirates and privateers sailing the Caribbean. The city's wealth attracted adventurers from across the seas, eager to capture some of the Spanish gold. In response, the Spanish Crown fortified Cartagena, making it one of the most heavily defended cities in the New World. Its massive walls, bastions, and fortresses—such as the formidable Castillo San Felipe de Barajas—still stand today as testament to its strategic importance. The tales of daring raids and fierce battles that took place around Cartagena are numerous. One of the most famous is the siege by Sir Francis Drake in 1586, who successfully captured the city and held it for ransom. Later, in the 18th century, the British Admiral Edward Vernon attempted a conquest with a large fleet and army, but despite initial successes, his forces were repelled after a grueling siege. Amidst the turbulence, Cartagena also emerged as a cultural and economic hub. The influx of wealth funded opulent churches, monasteries, and mans	1913	1930.1663

Garrick might have served as interpreter to that Asiatic king who asked the Romans for a mime by whose aid he might make himself understood by all the nations subject to his vast sway. "" When, some six months after that date, I was back again in London on my return journey to Paris, he took me to pass a few days at his country house near Hampton Court, on the banks of the Thames, with his amiable wife. She was German and had been a dancer; she had much grace and kindness of heart, and the sight of their union was charming."	There was an air of tranquil happiness about the place that was most refreshing to a weary traveler like myself. The house itself was modest but elegantly appointed, surrounded by lush gardens that were a testament to the care and attention they received. The river flowed gently by, a constant, soothing presence that added to the overall serenity of the setting. Garrick was a different man here, away from the clamor and demands of the city. His usual vivacity was tempered by a placid contentment, and his interactions with his wife were tender and full of affection. They seemed to communicate in a series of small gestures and shared glances, a silent language born of deep familiarity and mutual respect. It was clear that this place was a sanctuary for both of them, a haven from the outside world. Each morning after breakfast, which we took on the terrace overlooking the gardens, Garrick and I would stroll along the riverbank.

As Yorrick continued to reflect on the discussions that had taken place, he pondered the peculiar nature of fame and talent, and how one man's abilities could so captivate and divide public opinion. ""It is indeed a curious spectacle,"" he mused, ""to see how the masses oscillate between awe and critique, never fully settling on one or the other. But perhaps, that is the very essence of art—to evoke a spectrum of emotions, to be discussed, debated, and ultimately cherished in the manifold ways that human nature allows."" Thus, with his pen poised, Yorrick contemplated his next correspondence, eager to capture and relay the essence of the artistic fervor that had so engulfed the Parisian elite.

But there is more than this. London is also — as I have said — the nodal point of all the communications which bind eastern England. It was the point where the roads from the Yorkshire Plain and from the South Midlands and from East Anglia cross the Thames and catch on to the roads which give access to the Channel ports — especially those ports which command the narrower section of the Channel and stand over against the great continental approaches to this country, and which, therefore, will always be the   principal entry from the continent for supplies, alliance, intelligence, or any other form of aid. London thus blocks, and can permit or can restrain, communication by land between the eastern half of the island — the main part of it at least — and the southern counties and the Continent.	This strategic advantage has been recognized since ancient times, as is evidenced by the city's long history as a capital and a hub of trade and governance. Historically, London's position on the Thames has allowed it to control river traffic and thus dominate trade routes both domestically and internationally. The river itself has served as a critical artery through which goods, ideas, people, and influences have flowed, further establishing London as a center of power and culture. Moreover, the convergence of major roads in London not only facilitated the commercial and cultural exchanges but also made the city a pivotal military outpost. During times of conflict, control over London meant control over these crucial land routes, enabling mobilization of resources and strategic defense against invasions from the continent. In modern times, while the significance of physical roads has perhaps diminished with advances in technology and transportation, London continues to hold a key position in terms of telecommunications and digital connectivity, effectively controlling data flows in much the same way it once regulated the passage of chariots and steam engines. Thus, London's role as a nodal point extends beyond mere geography. It	1912	2001.7484
And so on, to the same purpose. As Palla dina wanted to be convinced, her mother soon had succeeded in convincing her. Saving money toward a desired end becomes a passion. Palladina, in the throes of this passion, became a miser in order to put one penny on top of another. She worked overtime when there was half an excuse, and saved the supper money intact, often going hungry. And the bank account began to grow fascinatingly. It was in mid may, the wedding four weeks distant. Palladina had been measured for the wedding dress, by a dressmaker recommended by Robert's mother. On a Saturday afternoon the young girl, home from the office at three o'clock, was hurrying to get ready to go out again, for she had an appointment for a fitting of the precious gown. While pinning on her hat, she heard the children crying, Dandy barking, and a strange voice, all mingled terrifyingly together in the narrow hall. Then Kate burst in on her sister, sobbing.	"""Something terrible has happened!"" Kate gasped between sobs, clutching at Palladina's arm.  Palladina's heart sank as she faced her sister, her mind racing with possibilities. ""What is it, Kate? What's wrong?"" ""It's Mr. Thompson, from next door,"" Kate managed to say, her voice shaking. ""He's fallen down the stairs and he's hurt really bad. They're calling for an ambulance now."" The urgency of the situation instantly cleared Palladina's mind of her own concerns. She quickly unfastened her hat and set it aside, her own troubles momentarily forgotten. ""Let's go, we need to see if we can help,"" she said, grabbing Kate's hand and leading her towards the door. As they rushed into the hall, the commotion was overwhelming. Neighbors had gathered, and the sound of Dandy barking anxiously added to the chaotic scene. Palladina moved with purpose, her earlier training in a first aid course guiding her actions. Reaching Mr. Thompson, she found him lying"	1913	1993.6986
You might as well propose to fit a ship for service by taking out its compass and its charts and cutting [ 106 ]  off its rudder. Make Christianity silent in regard to these great questions of spiritual existence, and you destroy its power to satisfy the heart. What would the life of Christ mean if these deep truths on which He rested and from which He drew His strength, were uncertain or illusory? It would be the most pathetic, mournful, heartbreaking of all phantoms. What consoling, cheering power would be left in the words of Jesus if His doctrine were blotted out and His precept left to stand alone? Try the experiment, if it may be done without irreverence: read His familiar discourses in the shadow of agnosticism.  ' Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is a hopeless poverty.	Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall not be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit a barren earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be forever famished.' Such would be the desolate litany of a Christ without assurance, a gospel stripped of the promise of eternal life and shorn of its connection to the divine. Indeed, without the spiritual compass that Christianity offers, the moral teachings of Christ lose their profound impact, becoming mere ethical suggestions devoid of transcendent authority or ultimate hope. It is this spiritual dimension, this promise of eternal life and divine justice, that imbues Christ's teachings with their deep, consoling power. It is what lifts them above the level of mere moral philosophy into the realm of life-transforming truth. The comfort offered by Christianity is not merely psychological; it is the comfort of knowing there is a higher order, a loving God who governs in wisdom and justice, and who offers a final home to the weary soul. Without this, Christianity would indeed be as a ship without	1908	1897.3347
This address, when it went forth to the people, was as a spark in a tinder box. It was a concrete statement of the case for popular sovereignty, clearly setting forth the real remedy for the evils that were breeding a revolutionary spirit in the people; and it showed exactly how the Senator's own state of Oregon had practically employed the effective remedies which he demanded as a solution to the gravest questions before the people. Soon the demands for that speech began to pour in from every section of the nation.	Leaflets and pamphlets bearing its text were printed by the thousand and distributed to eager hands across cities and rural areas alike. Clubs and societies, dedicated to reform and progress, organized readings and discussions around the fiery oration that had so succinctly captured the spirit of their cause. The Senator's words resonated deeply, striking chords of frustration with the status quo and igniting hopes for a tangible change. As the speech circulated, it became a rallying point for movements advocating for more direct involvement of the populace in their own governance. Town hall meetings, once sparsely attended, began to see record turnouts as citizens engaged passionately in debates over the principles the Senator had laid out. Calls for the implementation of referendums, recalls, and initiatives grew louder, echoing the successful measures taken in Oregon. The impact of this address was not confined to political circles or activist groups; it permeated into everyday conversations, becoming a topic of discussion at dinner tables, in workplaces, and at public gatherings. The idea of popular sovereignty, once an abstract concept to many, was now a vivid, attainable	1911	1989.1825
"Remy de Gourment speaks of this process, in its application to music, as the "" disassociation of harmonies, "" regarding Richard Strauss as the initiator of the method, which is synchronous with Impressionism in painting, and which has latterly extended to sculpture. Strauss is the prime disassociates; and Strauss is decadent. Claude Monet divided his tints, and Claude Monet is decadent ; while, later, we have Cezanne, Gauguin, and Henri mattise, than whom none more decadent could be found, except perhaps Vincent van Gogh, who has a place apart. In letters, the supreme realism of D'Annunzio's "" Romances of the Rose "" places the young Italian among the first decadents in this branch of art."	"The term ""decadent"" itself, as employed in these various contexts, is not merely pejorative, but descriptive of a movement toward the fragmentation of traditional forms and the exploration of new techniques and sensibilities. These artists and their methods, often characterized by a deliberate complexity or obscurity, seek to capture the fleeting impressions and the intrinsic instability of modern life. In literature, this tendency manifests as a departure from straightforward narrative techniques, embracing instead a more lyrical and evocative mode, as seen in the works of Symbolists like Mallarmé and Verlaine.  Each of these figures—Strauss with his dissonant harmonies, Monet with his divisionist brush strokes, and D'Annunzio with his ornate prose—pushes against the boundaries of their respective arts. They challenge their audiences to see, hear, and understand the world in radically new ways. This pursuit, often misunderstood by their contemporaries, is driven by a deep dissatisfaction with conventional expressions and a relentless quest for an art that more faithfully mirrors the fragmented reality of the modern experience"	1911	2006.0001
From their own account they could not say that it is better to seek that which is pleasurable than that which is disagreeable. But let ethics once give such a cue and scheme, let ethics once for all decide that the aim of life is pleasure or is physical welfare, and then everything can be quickly settled by the verdict of causal knowledge. We have only to seek and to calculate the effects which will be produced. Education itself then becomes subordinated to the pleasures which man is seeking. However often such a goal may have been silently accepted, we must reject it with earnest indignation.	No true advancement of humanity can arise from a creed so steeped in selfishness and so blind to the higher dimensions of human experience. The richness of life does not lie in the mere accumulation of pleasurable sensations, but rather in the pursuit of meaningful goals that challenge, refine, and elevate the human spirit. Ethics must aim higher than the simple calculus of pleasure and pain; it must consider the cultivation of virtues, the pursuit of justice, and the fostering of community and mutual respect. Education, therefore, should not be merely a tool for enhancing individual gratification but a means of enriching society by developing thoughtful, informed, and morally responsible individuals. It should inspire students to transcend their immediate desires and to engage with the broader human questions of meaning, value, and responsibility. This higher calling of education is essential for the cultivation of a society that values each person not merely for what they can contribute to the pleasure of others, but for their inherent dignity and potential to contribute to the common good. Thus, while pleasure and discomfort are components of the human experience, they should not be the compass by which	1909	1928.7476
The cotton operatives, who belong to the aristocracy of Trade Unionism, are showing a lack of understanding of the nature of their organisation, which is that of a union, uniting voluntarily for the protection of their common interests against the encroachments of their employers. An operative cannot be compelled to enter into any union without defeating the end and aim towards which the purposes of a union are set. The entire value of the union rests upon the willing cooperation of its members for the common good. A member who is held in, willy nilly, is not likely to prove any great help at the time of crisis, when everything depends upon a united, determined front.	It is essential, therefore, that each member's participation be rooted in a genuine understanding and agreement with the principles and goals of the union. This voluntary participation enhances not only the solidarity among the members but also empowers the union as a whole, making it a more formidable force in negotiations with employers. It fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility, which is crucial when collective action is needed. The leadership of the union must focus on educating its members about the benefits and responsibilities of being part of such a collective. This includes clear communication on how the union operates, what it stands for, and how it advocates on behalf of its members. Only through this comprehensive understanding can the operatives truly appreciate the significance of their contributions and the strength that unity brings. In this way, the union will not only maintain its integrity but will also grow stronger and more cohesive, ready to meet any challenges that lie ahead.	1911	1995.6984
In this his colleague, Josephus Scotus, followed his example and surpassed it . According to the Chronicle, in the year 773 'a fiery christ sign appeared in the heavens after sunset, ' and in the year 800, ' a cioss appeared in the moon on a Wednesday at dawn.' These are the only apparitions of the cross recorded. The first cruciform church of which we have record, after the church of Oswald at Heavenfield, was built in 810/ At some time early in the ninth century began the custom of erecting crosses adorned with the famous interlaced ornament. This custom seems to have come from Ireland, but to have spread rapidly over England, Scotland, and Wales. The custom continued in England, at any rate, up to the time of the Norman invasion. Finally, at the battle of Hastings, the army that fought with Harold in the defence of their country shouted the battle cry, ' The Holy Cross, the Cross of God!'	This invocation of the cross was not merely symbolic but carried a deep spiritual and cultural significance for Harold's forces. It represented a rallying point, a symbol of unity and divine protection against the invading Normans. The cross, having been a central motif in both religious and military contexts, was emblematic of their cause and their faith. The use of crosses in battle and in public life during this period was reflective of the deeply ingrained Christian values that permeated Anglo-Saxon society. The crosses, often elaborately decorated with the intricate interlacing typical of the time, were not only religious symbols but also works of art that demonstrated the craftsmanship and artistic skills of the period. Moreover, the cross as a motif continued to evolve post-Norman invasion, although the styles and the cultural implications shifted under the new rule. The Normans introduced their own architectural styles and religious symbols, which mingled with the existing Anglo-Saxon traditions, leading to a rich cultural amalgamation seen in the Romanesque architecture and the continued use of the Celtic cross in some regions. The legacy of the cross in England's	1904	2007.3463

In these cases, the courts have distinguished between actions at law and suits in equity, emphasizing the flexibility that equity provides. Equity, recognizing the injustice that can result from a strict adherence to the statute of frauds, allows for the doctrine of part performance as an exception to the requirement of a written agreement in certain circumstances. This exception is particularly relevant where the parties have acted on the agreement to such an extent that to deny enforcement would result in significant injustice. The principle underlying this doctrine is that the actions taken in reliance on the agreement effectively take the transaction out of the statute of frauds, making it enforceable despite the lack of a written contract. Actions that might constitute part performance include, but are not limited to, the payment of money, the improvement of property, or any other substantial change in position based on the belief that the agreement is valid. However, the acts of part performance must be unequivocally referable to the supposed agreement, such that they would not have been done unless there was a belief in the validity of the contract. Thus, while the statute	1913	1986.852
"Oftentimes because of this lack of leisure the discordant note is struck which later grows into utter lack of harmony. Sometimes too the duties of married life are so taxing in the early years when the children are small that women, because of their excess of physical work, begin to feel a mental deterioration, and this consciousness of a lack of growth or of cumulative happiness often is the pathway leading to the divorce court. On the other hand, if a woman by means of any previous training is enabled to keep in touch with the mental life of her family as well as the physical life, she has in her work of motherhood found the one thing in life worth while, and in her work then she can feel a sense of satisfaction in her own growth and activity or ""cumulative happiness, "" for she has found her share of the world's work. All the learning she can acquire will be none too """"Charities, "" Vol."	much, for it will not only enrich her own life but will also enable her to impart a richer heritage to her children. It is the well-informed mother who can guide her children through the complexities of modern life, equipping them with the wisdom and values they need to thrive. Furthermore, the intellectual engagement can act as a buffer against the monotony and isolation that sometimes accompany the early years of motherhood. Continuous learning and intellectual engagement allow her to maintain her individuality and personal growth, which are essential for her overall well-being. The role of education in enhancing the life of a mother cannot be overstated. It is through education that she gains the ability to critically analyze the world around her, make informed decisions for her family's welfare, and maintain a vibrant dialogue with her peers and community. This not only prevents the stagnation of her mental faculties but also ensures that she remains a dynamic participant in society, capable of contributing to its progress and setting a powerful example for her children. Thus, education and personal growth in motherhood are not merely beneficial; they are imperative for fostering a healthy	1911	2006.1542

By substituting the appropriate values and simplifying, we can derive the solution for the bending moment and shear forces along the span of the plate. The general solution will include terms for both homogeneous and particular solutions, reflecting both the natural response of the system and the effects of the applied loads. Continuing from this, the homogeneous solution can be determined by solving the differential equation with the boundary conditions applied, typically resulting in a series of trigonometric or polynomial terms depending on the complexity of the boundary conditions and the geometry of the plate. The constants in these solutions are then adjusted to meet the specific boundary conditions of the problem, ensuring that the plate's constraints are respected. For the particular integral, we look at the response due to external loading. This often requires the use of superposition principles, integrating the effects of distributed loads, point loads, or varying boundary conditions. In cases where the loading is complex, numerical methods such as finite element analysis may be employed to approximate the plate's response more accurately. By combining these solutions, we obtain a comprehensive view of the stress distribution	1908	1984.078
"Accordingly, the report calls for early and drastic measures of reform : "" the time for palliative measures has passed, and the hour has come for recognising facts as they exist, and for applying those measures which the facts demand, no matter how unwelcome the disillusionment that they bring."" I turn, however, from this, the enduring problem of India, to a brief consideration of recent social movements. It will have been apparent to even the most casual student of Indian affairs that the popular movement has undergone a change of character and direction during the past few years. Half a century ago the energies of that section of the community which had felt the impact of Western education were devoted to the bringing about of reforms — domestic, educational, and religious — closely in harmony with Western notions. Macaulay's prediction that the fabric of Hinduism would crumble in thirty years under the dissolvent of European education seemed at one time not particularly farfetched."	However, the anticipated dissolution has not occurred. Instead, a resurgence of nationalistic pride and a reevaluation of traditional values have marked the contemporary social landscape. This revival has been partly fueled by a deeper understanding and appreciation of India's own cultural heritage, ironically facilitated by the tools of Western learning. The focus has shifted from an uncritical acceptance of Western ideals to a more nuanced approach that seeks to blend the best of both Eastern and Western philosophies. Moreover, the rise of political consciousness among the masses, catalyzed by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, has redirected the energies of the educated classes towards achieving political and economic self-determination. The call for Swaraj, or self-rule, has become a rallying cry that transcends social and economic divisions, uniting various strata of society in a common cause. This shift is also evident in the sphere of social reform. While early reformers focused on practices such as child marriage and widow remarriage, contemporary movements have broadened their scope to include issues like caste discrimination, women's rights, and	1908	2004.6833
The truth is that the public mind has never grasped the essential difference between competition carried on in industries where the weakest producer is quickly eliminated, and the competition of companies employing vast masses of fixed capital which cannot be turned to other uses. Owing to the deadly effects of a  protracted rate war between railway lines, some form of common understanding, either by the pooling of traffic, or the fixing of minimum rates is almost inevitable. Moreover, while the public is thus prevented from getting the advantages of competition, it does not get the economies which come from monopoly. For, though the commercial policy of the railways is unified, their internal management is not. The travelling public and the shippers of goods have to pay for duplicated staffs and offices, and superfluous trains and termini.	The situation is further complicated by the fact that each railway company, while nominally cooperating with others, often strives to maintain its own interests above the collective good. This leads to inefficiencies and a lack of true systematization across the network, resulting in higher operational costs that are inevitably passed on to consumers. It is a paradox where the infrastructure intended to serve the public efficiently becomes entangled in its own web of competitive survival strategies. In essence, the railway industry presents a unique case where neither pure competition nor complete monopoly offers the ideal solution. The challenge lies in finding a middle ground that minimizes wasteful redundancies while maximizing the potential for service improvement and cost reduction. This could potentially be addressed through more stringent regulatory frameworks that encourage collaboration while still preserving elements of competition to spur innovation and service enhancement. Such regulatory oversight might involve the standardization of certain operations, the sharing of critical infrastructure, and the establishment of fair pricing models that are scrutinized and approved by an independent body. Only through such coordinated efforts can the railway industry hope to achieve the kind of efficiency and service quality that the public rightfully	1908	1997.7744
"""I venture to say that you dare not, gentlemen. You dare not convert the laws of this Commonwealth into obstacles to the acquisition of truth. You dare not do it, gentlemen — and yet that is what you are asked to do exactly, if you pass this bill. ""Pray do not fail, Mr. Chairman, to catch my point. You are not to ask yourself whether these mind curers do really achieve the successes that are claimed. It is enough for you as legislators to ascertain that a large number of our citizens, persons as intelligent and well educated as yourself, or I, persons whose number seems daily to increase, are convinced that they do achieve them, are per  551 suaded that a valuable new department of medical experience is by them opening up."	Indeed, it would be an act of supreme arrogance and folly to dismiss their testimonies as mere delusions or fabrications. Such a dismissal would not only undermine the very principles of empirical investigation, which are foundational to both science and a progressive society, but it would also represent a profound disrespect to those citizens who have found solace and healing through these unconventional methods. Therefore, I urge you, gentlemen, to consider the broader implications of this legislation. It is not merely a question of regulating a new medical practice, but rather, it is a question of whether we, as a body of lawmakers, are willing to embrace innovation and the potential for new knowledge. Are we to close the door on what may very well be a significant advancement in the understanding of human health and healing, simply because it does not fit within the traditional paradigms?

For the screws tested K decreased somewhat with increasing velocity. Results are also given for a screw of 0-824 in. diameter, with 12 blades 0'027 m. wide, which could be rotated to vary the pitch. Plotting the mean value of K against the pitch angle, it is found that K is a maximum when the angle is approximately 2°, and that the value of K is then double that of a disc of area equal to the circle described by the screw.	As the pitch angle increases beyond 2°, K begins to decrease, indicating a reduction in the efficiency of the screw. This trend continues until the pitch angle reaches around 15°, beyond which the value of K stabilizes but remains significantly lower than its maximum value at 2°. The relationship between pitch angle and K suggests an optimal configuration at lower angles for achieving higher performance metrics. Additionally, the tests showed that at higher rotational speeds, the effectiveness of the screw diminishes slightly, which could be attributed to increased frictional forces and possibly the onset of turbulent flow conditions that reduce the screw's ability to efficiently translate rotational motion into linear thrust. Further experiments varying the number of blades and the width of the blades could provide more insights into the optimal design parameters for screws in different fluid dynamics applications. This could potentially lead to more efficient designs for applications ranging from marine propulsion systems to industrial mixing equipment.	1912	2004.4398
"Once they spoke of their old life and of the quarrelsome brothers and sisters at home. Near the little house in which John Henry kept his gardening tools John Adam built his workshop. The doors faced each other; when both men were at work, it was like being in one room. In the evenings John Henry read to John Adam as of old. Their wives began to go about; they joined church societies, and they made friends in the village. It was fortunate that the two men had each other. John Adam was not bright eyed and firm mouthed like his brother; he was weaker in character, and depended a great deal upon John Henry. The summer after they were married Lizzie went to her husband with a complaint about her sister. "" She tells the people that she helps with my work. You tell him to tell her to stop it."" John Henry stared. "" But she does help you. I saw her baking biscuit for you last week."""	"Lizzie's face flushed with indignation. ""That was once, John Henry, just once. And she tells it as if she's always in our kitchen, meddling with my duties."" John Henry sighed softly, running a hand through his hair. ""Lizzie, she's trying to be friendly, to be family. Maybe it's her way of feeling more at home here."" ""But it's not right, it's not the truth,"" Lizzie protested, her voice tinged with frustration. ""I want our home to be our own, not made into a spectacle for the village through her tales."" Seeing her distress, John Henry nodded slowly. ""Alright, I'll speak to John Adam about it. We'll sort it out quietly."" He paused, then added, ""But remember, she's new here as well, and finding her place might take time. Let's try to be a bit patient, too."" Lizzie bit her lip, nodding reluctantly. ""I'll try, but I want it clear she's not to overstep."" ""That's fair,"" John Henry agreed"	1913	1992.8185
There is not so much true chivalry abroad that we can afford to treat it cavalierly when we find it in woman. What, then, should be the rule in a situation such as the Titanic had to face, where, of men and women together, only a limited number could be saved? First and foremost, the element of sex should be eliminated. To do this the men and women should be separated, and boats allotted to each sex in proportion to its numbers. It would be obviously unfair to women to compel them to struggle with men of the less fine sort; while, on the other hand, it would be equally unfair to the men, whom long tradition has accustomed to hold that women are entitled to preferential treatment, if they were compelled to struggle with women for their own safety.	"The principle of ""women and children first"" though noble in its intent, must be weighed against practicality and fairness under such dire circumstances. It is imperative that a more systematic approach be adopted. Each lifeboat should be filled to capacity with an equitable distribution of men and women, based on their presence on the vessel. This method not only ensures the maximal use of available resources but also honors the principle of equal value of life, irrespective of gender. Furthermore, priority should be given to those with responsibilities towards dependents. Parents, regardless of gender, who have children on board, should be given precedence to ensure that the young and vulnerable are not left without care. Similarly, individuals with medical or navigational skills, crucial for survival, should be considered for early evacuation, regardless of their sex. Such measures, though they may seem cold in the face of traditional chivalrous values, are essential for the greater good and survival of the maximum number of people. In moments of life and death, the romantic notions of chivalry must adapt to the necessities of survival and the ethos of fairness and equality"	1911	1975.7742
"And sitting down by the red stove, he fell a dreaming and mumbling to himself with clasped hands, and men said he was breaking up fast, and that the days of the townhouse orator were numbered. It was half past one before the polls were closed; and it was two precisely when the moderator, standing in front of a draped American flag, took off his glasses decisively and, bringing down his rude mallet, roared: ""Gentlemen, this ain't no funny house. Proceed to business."" It was the twelfth article of the town warrant which asked the town what it would do about the almshouse. ""Now, gentlemen, what do you say to it. The young lady is waiting, "" said the moderator. He referred to the public stenographer, who sat at his elbow in a bhie knitted cap, and with whose graciousness and patience and high skill he had been much impressed. He felt that they ought not to keep her waiting. Old Vitriol rose, with his hands clasped under his corduroy jacket, and said, in strong tones, that the town should sell."	"""Sell it, I say! The almshouse has been nothing but a sink of funds for years. It's old, it's decrepit, it's a burden on the taxpayer's back. Let's get rid of it, turn it into something profitable, something that can benefit the whole community instead of draining it!"" There was a murmur of agreement from some corners of the hall, but not everyone was convinced. From the back, a tall figure rose, clearing his throat to catch the moderator's attention before speaking. ""Mr. Moderator,"" began Farmer Gray, his voice steady and commanding attention, ""I hear what Old Vitriol is saying, but we need to think of those less fortunate than ourselves. The almshouse might be old, but it's a refuge for many. Perhaps instead of selling, we should consider renovating. Improve what we have, make it more efficient, more welcoming. Isn't that a better use of our resources?"" The hall erupted into a cacophony of voices, some siding with Old Vitriol's practical, albeit harsh view"	1913	1960.5055

In these illustrations, the transformation from the original two-foot channels to the newer, wider four-foot configurations clearly demonstrates the increased efficiency in airflow management. The diagrams show that with the implementation of the high pitch fan, the channel running time is significantly reduced, indicating a more efficient passage of air through the modified channel. The removal of the end panels, as depicted in Fig. 26, further enhances this effect by minimizing the resistance typically caused by these structures. This adaptation allows for a smoother transition of air, reducing turbulence and the subsequent energy required to maintain flow rates. This series of modifications and their impacts, as recorded by the gauges, underline the importance of channel design and fan interaction in optimizing air distribution systems. The low pitch fan, while less effective in this setup, still shows improved performance over the original configuration, emphasizing the versatility and adaptability of the system to different operational needs.	1912	2004.7941
In removing these suckers, they should be pulled away from the stock and not simply cut off. Only one shoot should be permitted to grow from each cion and this should be the thriftiest and generally that starting lowest down. The lowest is saved because, wherever a shoot starts, there is generally a crook formed, and if near the ground it is not unsightly. Night Cap is a term given to signify a paper bag that is sometimes drawn over and tied below a graft made in the open as soon as it Is completed. It Is illustrated in Fig. 86. Its use is to prevent the shrivelling of the cion due to exposure of drying winds. It is especially desirable in top grafting trees in dry seasons or in exposed locations.	The bag acts as a barrier, trapping moisture around the cion and maintaining a more consistent microenvironment. This simple but effective method can significantly enhance the survival rate of the graft by mitigating rapid temperature fluctuations and reducing water loss. The night cap should be left in place until the graft has taken hold and begun to show signs of growth. It is important, however, to monitor the graft periodically to ensure that the bag does not foster a humid environment that could lead to fungal infections or other diseases. As the cion establishes itself, gradually acclimating it to the external conditions by making small perforations in the bag or briefly removing it during cooler parts of the day can be beneficial. This gradual exposure helps the graft to harden off before the bag is finally removed, thus preventing shock from sudden changes in the environment.	1914	2007.62

As you are well aware, Dr. Burney is a man of considerable merit, not only in the field of music, where he has achieved considerable distinction, but also in letters, where his erudition and eloquence are equally to be admired. His recent works in the realm of music history have garnered him accolades from the most discerning critics, and his travels through the continent collecting material for his volumes have added greatly to our understanding of the musical practices of Europe. I am confident that an introduction to a personage of your influence and taste will be mutually beneficial. Dr. Burney, ever eager to expand his acquaintance among the learned and the influential, is particularly desirous of your insights into the current state of the arts in Paris, which, as you know, is the heart of cultural life in Europe. He is also keen to discuss his findings and share the fascinating anecdotes and observations he has collected during his travels.

Yet some faint misgiving led her to want to defend herself, to explain before she went. My own notion is that she meant me to understand everything in the end and nothing at the time — which is just what happened. Yet I have always been haunted by the idea that she may have expected me to guess. What, in that case, she would have wanted me to do I cannot say. Perhaps merely, in the tense quiet of that hour, to go mentally all the way with her and approve her tacitly to the last. I do not know. Let me compress history for those who have forgotten, or who never plucked out and wove together the shreds of news that appeared at intervals in the fickle tissue of the press. Mrs. Edgell and Levering left together for foreign parts.	They were seen in Paris, then later in Vienna, and eventually, reports placed them in the more obscure reaches of the Balkans. Rumors swirled, of course, as they are wont to do, but no concrete evidence ever surfaced to paint the full picture of their circumstances or intentions. The world, ravenous for scandal, chewed over every morsel it could gather, yet the truth remained as elusive as a shadow at dusk. It was said that Mrs. Edgell, in her usual manner, carried herself with an air of serene detachment, as if she were merely a spectator in her own life's drama. Levering, on the other hand, appeared increasingly uneasy, perhaps burdened by the weight of their decision. Whether he regretted their flight, or simply the public censure it invited, one could only speculate. As the years trickled past, their trail grew colder, the mentions in the press fewer and more speculative. The last credible sighting was in a small town on the edge of the Black Sea, after which they seemed to vanish into the m	1913	1902.1428

Sexual passion in this respect indeed fulfils the service of a nearer deity: even as we more remotely make our god the highest we can conceive, in passion we create for ourselves a more intimate divinity. So Beatrice served for Dante. The more perfect this projection, the more alien does passion become to the call of the physical. Not because it chooses to forego the physical, but because its joys are intenser and more lasting — such joys as we can conceive bespeaking a force which, far from being overthrown in the physical, can carry us on beyond its threshold. Moreover, emotions which arise from sexual passion are responsible for that aspect of spiritual growth which we may call other mindedness, and which is behind the little understood, though widely practised, principles of chivalry and self sacrifice. The intense passion, with its implied concentration and sympathy with one, quickens attention and sympathy with all.	This broadening of emotional capacity, while rooted in the particular, paradoxically extends to the universal. Through the ardor of individual attachment, one is taught the language of universal compassion. Thus, passion, while deeply personal, does not remain confined to the self or to the beloved alone. It acts as a bridge, extending the soul’s reach, allowing it to touch upon the shores of broader human experiences and empathies. In the fires of such passion, the self is both lost and found—lost to its former narrow confines and found anew in the expanse of a more encompassing love. In literature and art, this transformation is often depicted as the hero’s journey or the poet’s awakening. The lover, through trials of the heart, emerges wiser and more attuned to the subtleties of human nature. This evolution reflects the inherent potential of passion to elevate the human spirit beyond its primal instincts, refining it through the crucible of deep, interpersonal experience. Thus, passion serves not only as a powerful force of attraction but as a crucible for spiritual and moral development, shaping	1911	1927.2457
Tom L. Johnson was about thirty years old when he took this railroad journey and bought from a train newsboy a cheap paper covered copy of a book called Social Problems. Of the author of the book, Henry George, he had never be  292 fore heard. What wonder? Johnson was not a book student. George had come out of the West with a book called Progress and Poverty. These two books, Progress and Poverty and Social Problems, were attracting wide attention. Although treating of the science of political economy, their style was stripped of technical and dry as dust terminology and statement. They offered essential principles in simple, vivid language. They pulsed with sympathy and meaning for the unschooled.	Johnson, a practical man more accustomed to the gritty realities of business than the theoretical musings of scholars, found himself unexpectedly captivated by George's arguments. He read voraciously, absorbing the ideas that George presented about the injustices of land monopoly and the potential of a single tax on land value to alleviate economic inequality and promote social justice. It was a revelation to him, a shift from his previous focus solely on profit and enterprise. The impact of this reading was profound and immediate. Johnson began to see his business activities and his role in society through a new lens. He started questioning the very foundations upon which his fortunes were built and pondered deeply on the societal responsibilities of the wealthy and powerful. This marked the beginning of his transformation from a business magnate into a reform-minded political figure. Inspired by George's vision, Johnson soon became an advocate for progressive causes, using his influence and resources to champion the rights of the less fortunate. His political career, which eventually led him to become the mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, was heavily influenced by the principles he first encountered in that paper-covered	1911	1990.6293
Proposal to be Accompanied by Consent of Sureties. a notice to bidders requiring that “the proposal should specify the names of the sureties offered, with the written consent of the persons so named, ” has been held reasonable, and it was held that by reason of neglect to furnish the written consent prescribed, the lowest bidder was not entitled to have the contract awarded him ; and the fact that he was present at the opening of the proposals accompanied by responsible persons for the purpose of giving their written consent to the use of their names as sureties did not remedy the omission to specify their names in the sealed proposals.

The principle behind such requirements is to ensure the reliability and commitment of the bid. The court's decision emphasizes the necessity for bidders to adhere strictly to the stipulations set forth in the bidding documents. Failure to comply with even seemingly minor details can result in the disqualification of a bid, underscoring the importance of precision and attention to detail in contractual procedures. This requirement serves not only to verify the financial and moral backing of the bidder but also to protect the interests of the entity issuing the bid from potential legal or financial complications that could arise from accepting an improperly secured proposal. The courts have consistently upheld that such stipulations are not merely procedural but are essential to the integrity and fairness of the competitive bidding process. Therefore, bidders must ensure that all aspects of their proposals, including the provision of surety details, are in complete conformity with the specified requirements to avoid the risk of disqualification.	1913	1996.7299
To prevent damage to the machine after fracture of the test piece, buffers are inserted at DD. A spring S, with tightening nut N, provides a means of subjecting the test piece to any required initial stress, so that the inertia forces then cause Fig. 228. — Dr. Smith's patent reversal testing machine. stress between limits the mean value of which is not zero, the position but not the magnitude of the range of stress being altered.	The spring S is calibrated to ensure that the correct level of tension is applied consistently throughout each test. This feature is particularly important when dealing with materials that exhibit significant strain hardening or those that are sensitive to stress concentrations. Additionally, the introduction of the spring mechanism allows for a more dynamic testing environment where cyclic stresses can be applied to simulate real-world operating conditions more accurately. The buffers at DD are made of a high-impact material that absorbs energy efficiently and minimizes the risk of mechanical shock transferring back to the machine's structural components. This not only protects the integrity of the machine itself but also ensures that the data collected during the fracture process remains accurate and reliable, free from anomalies caused by sudden jarring or vibrations. Furthermore, the tightening nut N allows for fine adjustments to be made to the spring tension. This is crucial for tests that require very specific stress conditions or for comparative analysis across different materials or batches. By adjusting the nut, the operator can precisely control the preload applied to the specimen, thereby tailoring the test parameters to meet specific research requirements or industry standards. Overall, the design of	1908	2006.3971
Even at the Khan Khasura, the inn to which the good Samaritan is supposed to have taken the man whom the thieves had beset, my new acquaintance only looked in, saw the pilgrims drinking water and munching crusts, and went on. Clouds of dust pursued us over the mountains. The road rising from the grandeur of Bethany wound in long curves round the breast of the hills. We were all alone in the world. Only occasionally there came a line of mules or camels with dark Bedouin Arabs passing us or overtaking us.	The landscape was stark and barren, dotted sporadically with sparse vegetation and the occasional olive tree, its gnarled branches testifying to centuries of existence. The sun beat down mercilessly, casting long, stark shadows that shifted as it journeyed across the sky. The air was dry, carrying with it the scent of dust and the faint, resinous aroma of distant herbs warmed by the relentless sun. As we continued our ascent, the path narrowed, and the rocky terrain demanded careful navigation. Each step stirred up little puffs of dust that the gentle breeze whisked away. The silence was profound, broken only by the occasional distant cry of a hawk or the soft clattering of our own footsteps on the stony path. The Bedouins moved with a grace that spoke of their deep familiarity with this harsh landscape. Cloaked in traditional garb that fluttered slightly with the breeze, they seemed like spirits of the desert, fleeting and enigmatic. Their eyes, when they met ours, held a depth of stories untold, of centuries of life lived in the rhythm of the desert	1913	1995.2886
"The statement of Dr. Vincent, in a recent address before the Counsel on Medical Education in Chicago, that ""the medical Slite (a term which he constantly reiterates in his talk) must have the vigilance and courage to protect itself not only against enemies without, but against traitors within, "" rather gives the impression that he is speaking for an aristocracy of medicine which should be the ruling class in the profession. Such government by a clique, even the supposedly superior, is un american and unpopular. But he has voiced the real intent of the A. M. A. This bold attempt to place all medical men under a body of allopathic absolute censors is the potent reason why those of us outside the pale of ""regular"" medicine so heartily oppose the movement, and ask the people, whose rights are also threatened, to aid us in the contest."	This controversy strikes at the very heart of democratic values and the principle of diversity within the medical field. The notion that a select few should dictate the broad directives and standards of medical practice undermines the foundational spirit of innovation and varied perspectives that drive the advancement of medical science.  Moreover, Dr. Vincent's call for a vigilant defense against purported 'traitors within' fosters a climate of divisiveness and suspicion that can only serve to stifle constructive dialogue and collaboration among professionals with differing views. In a field as critical and dynamic as medicine, it is essential to foster an environment where diverse methodologies and opinions can be openly discussed and evaluated based on merit and scientific evidence, rather than allegiance to a particular school of thought. As such, it is incumbent upon the broader community and stakeholders in the healthcare system to closely scrutinize such movements within medical governance. It is vital that the governance of medicine remains transparent, inclusive, and democratically oriented to ensure that it serves the best interests of all, rather than a self-appointed elite. The evolution of medical practice must be guided by a collective commitment to patient welfare and	1911	2004.5529
"For some time he seemed to be groping. He murmured, "" I wanted to do good on easter day."" ""Had you something to tell me? What was it?"" After such a mental effort that the tension was felt by both the others, he said, ""I can't remember."" ""Come and sit down here by me, and we'll remember together."" ""It's gone, "" he replied, hanging his head. ""Please excuse me. I am a poor excuse now, but I would have been a minister. This serves me right for not leaving everything to the Reverend Doctor. He is a prince of a man."" Achsa shot a sarcastic glance at the  846 HARPER's MONTHLY MAGAZINE window; and at that moment it occurred to her, ""If this poor fellow should discover his reverend doctor now, there in the dark, the prince of a man would be in danger of sharing my reputation in this precious community. He will be sure to think of that."	"But no, he won't think of it. He's too good, too trusting—too wrapped up in his own world of ideals."" She sighed softly, her gaze returning to the man before her.

""You wanted to do good—that intent alone is worth more than any title or position. Remember that."" Her words seemed to lift a shadow from his countenance, a slight unburdening that allowed a weak smile to form on his lips. ""Thank you, Miss,"" he murmured, his voice a mix of gratitude and lingering sadness. ""I suppose the good Lord knows our hearts, and that must suffice.""

The fact that from a tissue like the brain by the simple procedure followed in preparing protagone a product of fairly constant composition should be obtained is no proof that this is a single substance and not a mixture. And as a matter of fact in order to isolate from this product what are called its cleavage products it is not necessary to use aqueous or methyl alcoholic solutions of baryta as was done by Kossel and Freytag and others, nor any active hydrolytic reagents: simple selective solvents, a mixture of methyl alcohol and chloroform (Thierfelder) or pyridine (Rosenheim and Tebb) suffice to separate the ingredients of this mixture. Thudichum devised methods for the separation and identification of many substances from the brain, which he worked at for years, without, however, furnishing convincing proof that the operations involved were without influence upon the chemical composition of the substances submitted to them.	Despite these uncertainties, Thudichum's pioneering work laid important groundwork for subsequent biochemical investigations into brain chemistry. His efforts to characterize brain lipids, for instance, marked significant strides in understanding the complex chemical makeup of neurological tissues. While his methods may have had shortcomings, they were instrumental in highlighting the diversity of chemical components in the brain, paving the way for more refined techniques. The evolution of biochemistry has since introduced more precise and less invasive methods of separation and analysis, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These advancements have allowed scientists to isolate and study brain substances with greater accuracy and without altering their chemical structures significantly during the process. The study of brain chemistry continues to evolve, with modern techniques focusing not only on isolating individual compounds but also on understanding their interactions and functions within the broader system of the brain. This holistic approach is crucial for unraveling the biochemical underpinnings of neural processes and for the development of targeted therapies for neurological disorders. Thudichum's early contributions, therefore,	1913	2007.5468
Free air temperature curve lies to left of curve for rising unsaturated parcels. 51 descent of an individual parcel. On this sheet any parcel may be moved at will for testing purposes. All vertical motions of individual parcels must be along a thermal curve representing a rate of temperature change of 5.5F/1000 feet. An ascending parcel will be cooled at that rate and a descending parcel will be heated at the same rate. On the graph in Figure 31. Air which is unstable in lower levels up to 6000-7000 feet but very stable above 7000.	This stability profile indicates that the atmosphere is conditionally unstable. When air parcels at lower levels gain enough energy to ascend, they can rise rapidly until they reach the stable layer at 7000 feet, where their ascent will likely be halted or slowed significantly. This could lead to the formation of cumulus clouds at the boundary between the unstable and stable air layers, potentially resulting in convective weather phenomena such as thunderstorms if sufficient moisture and additional lifting mechanisms are present. Above this stable layer, the air parcels, having a higher temperature than the surrounding environment due to adiabatic heating during descent, become negatively buoyant and begin to sink. This sinking motion can further stabilize the atmosphere, creating a cap that suppresses further vertical development of clouds and storms. In practical meteorological applications, understanding this vertical profile of temperature and stability is crucial for predicting weather conditions, especially for activities such as aviation, where knowledge of turbulence and cloud formation is essential for safety and route planning. The use of sounding data, combined with other meteorological tools, helps forecasters assess the potential for severe weather and plan accordingly	1913	1996.0087
The great banking and monopoly seeking commercial classes are amply able to care for themselves, and the way in which the banking fraternity is pushing forward the Wall street Aldrich currency scheme clearly indicates that this privilege seeking class is quite as wide awake to its special interest as are any of the great industrial trusts. It is with the rights, the interests and the liberties of the people that the press of the nation should be ranged; but unhappily, such is the strength of the money power that few great dailies are found voicing the deadly peril that confronts the nation.	Indeed, the sway of these financial titans extends deep into the very sinews of the media, influencing public opinion with a subtlety that masks their underlying motives. The common citizen, often distracted by the daily struggles of life, may not perceive the gradual encroachment of these monopolistic powers until it becomes too late. It is here that the smaller, independent publications must take up the mantle, championing the cause of the average person and shedding light on the maneuvers of the financial elite. These smaller outlets, unburdened by the heavy chains of corporate sponsorship, can afford to question and critique the movements of the financial sector with greater freedom. They serve as the crucial counterbalance, ensuring that the narrative fed to the public is not unilaterally authored by those with the deepest pockets. It is through such vigilant journalism that democracy breathes and maintains its vigor, providing a platform for diverse perspectives and safeguarding the populace from becoming unwitting pawns in a larger economic game controlled by a few.	1911	1970.7546
Unpleasantly realistic as some of these were upon close inspection, when seen from a distance they looked like great jewels of many colours, born forward on a black stream of humanity, swaying slowly from side to side, the gold with which One of the ancient city Gates  51(5 Plaza de los Loches they were richly ornamented glittering and flashing in the tropic sunlight. One of these crucifixes is of more than ordinary interest, not only because of its miraculous powers, but on account of the strange manifestations attending its production.	It is said that during its crafting, the artisan, a devout and solitary man, experienced visions of saints and angels guiding his hand. As he worked, the room filled with an inexplicable golden light and the air hummed with soft music, untraceable to any earthly source. Upon its completion, the crucifix was not merely an object of beauty, but a vessel of profound spiritual power.  Devotees believe that prayers offered before it are particularly efficacious, and many a miracle has been attributed to its influence. On feast days, the crucifix is paraded through the streets, drawing crowds from near and far. The sick are brought forth, and tales abound of healings wrought in its shadow. The devout throng presses close, hoping for a touch of the hem of the priest’s garment or a mere brush against the sacred wood. This crucifix, therefore, is not only a remarkable artifact of religious artistry but also a cornerstone of local faith and tradition. Its history is woven with the stories of the people themselves, a symbol of their enduring spirituality and deep-seated	1913	1891.3453
They claim for this holder (of which we have a sample) that it is especially easy to wire, has perfect insulation, and a very strong cord grip. . . 440 New Shades for High Pressure Keith Lamps. Two new types of shade have recently been developed by Messrs. James Keith & Blackman Co., Ltd. (27, Farringdon illustrate herewith, consists of an opal screen surrounding the upper part of the ordinary clear glass shade. This serves to protect the eyes from the glare of the bare mantle, and at the same time allows an upward diffusion of the light, Avenue, London, EG. ), for use with their high pressure inverted incandescent gas lamps. The first of these, which wo though riot in any way obstructing the path of the downward rays.	The second type is a more ornate affair, designed to harmonize with the more decorative environments. It features a frosted glass with an intricate etched pattern, which not only diffuses the light evenly to reduce harshness but also adds a touch of elegance to the fixture. This shade is particularly suitable for use in dining rooms or areas where a softer, more ambient light is preferred. Both types of shades are engineered to fit seamlessly with the existing Keith Lamps models, ensuring that users can upgrade their lighting without the need for additional hardware or significant adjustments. The company emphasizes the durability of the materials used in these new shades, as well as their ability to resist the heat emitted by high-pressure gas lamps, thus promising a longer lifespan and continued aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, these innovations come at a time when there is increasing consumer demand for lighting solutions that combine functionality with style. The introduction of these shades by James Keith & Blackman Co. reflects their commitment to meeting these market needs while continuing to offer high-quality, reliable products.	1912	2007.1687
Furthermore, she held that the employment of mesmerism or suggestion was fraught with the gravest peril, for here one human mind was dominated by another. The patient's imperial will passed measurably under the control of the practitioner. This would be a dangerous power even if human nature were less frail than experience proves it to be. Hence to Mrs. Glover it became clear that treatment along the lines of magnetic passes, physical manipulation and mesmerism carried with it the danger of mental enslavement or the disturbing of the mental equilibrium, infatuation or passional insanity — terrible potential results that were the exact antithesis of those following the practice of Scriptural healing by the Founder of Christianity, the Apostles and the Church Fathers. In bold opposition to these nineteenth century theories was the Bible teaching as apprehended by Mrs. Glover after her long years of patient study and consecration. In the Bible she believed that at last she found the solution of the great problem. Christ had taught the supremacy of the spiritual.	This was the true healing power, she concluded, one that transcended the mere physical or mental manipulation of beings by one another. Through prayer and divine faith, healing was to be achieved not by human will imposing itself upon another, but through the recognition and manifestation of God's omnipotent and benevolent will. It was this spiritual understanding and reliance upon the Divine rather than upon human techniques that formed the cornerstone of her approach. Mrs. Glover advocated for a return to these early Christian principles, emphasizing the need for purity, prayer, and the nurturing of one's spiritual relationship with God as the fundamental means of healing. This path, she argued, avoided the ethical pitfalls and dangers inherent in the manipulation of mental faculties by human intervention. Her focus was on the cultivation of a deep, personal connection to the divine, facilitating not just physical healing, but a holistic restoration of the individual's spiritual well-being. Her teachings, developed through years of devotion and interpretation of Scripture, eventually laid the groundwork for a new movement in spiritual healing, challenging contemporary practices and setting a precedent for future generations seeking solace and recovery	1911	1941.6178
Yet, to those who were closely about her, to the great world that but little more than heard about her, even to those who were under obligation to interpret as truthfully as possible, it may be doubted if any one ever got more than an inkling of the great mental anguish or even physical distress suffered by her, until she herself as pathetically as surely made it known. Assuredly, the manner and speech and life of the household and neighbourhood did not evince much beyond commonplace understanding sympathy and effort. And as the most interested may now look back upon his own thought and care of her, how paltry, too, how inefficient, how bungling, compared with what it ought to have been or might have been, does it all now seem!	Indeed, the depth of her suffering was such that it lay beyond the reach of the casual observer, cloaked as it was beneath a veneer of stoic composure. She bore her burdens with a grace that belied the turmoil that churned within her, masking her pain with a smile so convincing that even those closest to her were often deceived. Her resilience, a facade crafted from necessity, fooled even those tasked with providing comfort and support.  In retrospect, the efforts made to alleviate her distress seem all the more inadequate. The attempts to soothe and console, though well-intentioned, were clumsy and often missed the mark, addressing only the superficial symptoms of her woes while leaving the deeper agonies untouched. The realization of this inadequacy, coming too late, brings with it a poignant mix of regret and helplessness, a lament for what could have been—a more profound, more empathetic communion that might have eased her journey through the shadows.  It is a harsh truth that often, those who suffer greatly do so in silence, their deepest struggles hidden away, leaving behind	1911	1988.4642
As the first of these, this typical New eng lander is represented as regularly using axe for ask. Now axe is a form which has fallen from its once high estate. It was at an earlier period in the best of literary use, as readers of Chaucer well know. So it remained for nearly two centuries following the time of that author. It is, indeed, a mere accident of usage that all of us are not saying it now. But after the sixteenth century it was relegated to the dialects of the British Isles. In them it still flourishes vigorously. Except from the mouths of immigrants, however, it is with us hardly heard anywhere outside of scattered communities.	"In these communities, it has survived as a vestige of old linguistic forms, preserved through generations by families and groups who have remained relatively isolated from broader linguistic shifts. This preservation is an example of how language can serve as a living record of cultural and historical movements. The use of ""axe"" instead of ""ask"" is not simply a linguistic error as some might hastily conclude, but rather a reflection of a deep-seated historical lineage that traces back to Middle English and beyond.  Thus, when we encounter such forms in speech today, they should be seen not merely as anomalies, but as important reminders of the rich tapestry of language evolution. They offer insights into the ways in which language functions not only as a tool for communication but also as a repository of history, revealing patterns of migration, settlement, and interaction among various linguistic communities."	1913	2007.1958
At  the outset I submit that we hardly any of us adequately know our facts, and hence that we cannot even dream our Utopia more than vaguely, much less define any single portion of it until we have come to know and understand something at least of what it is that gives this local character which we value to our neighbourhood, our town. The exploration of Chelsea is crowded with interest, full of significance; and the detailed instructions for setting about this, in ramble after ramble, are to be found in no mere scanty summary as of Baedeker, but in the admirable guide book of Mr. Reginald Blunt, a topographic survey which I must not only recommend but assume as one of the essentials of our Utopian library.	It is through such diligent study and exploration that we begin to piece together the mosaic of local identity, to discern the nuanced interplay between historical legacy and contemporary life that shapes the spirit of a place. Chelsea, with its rich tapestry of artistic and literary history, its river views and its distinctive architecture, offers a particularly vivid example of how locale molds experience and expectation. It is not merely the physical space that defines Chelsea, but the cumulative imprint of those who have walked its streets: the painters, the poets, the radicals, and the eccentrics. In delving into the character of our own locales, we must adopt a similar approach. We must walk the streets, yes, but also read the histories, engage with the community, observe the interactions at markets, parks, and local events. We must understand the forces of change—economic, social, political—that act upon our neighborhoods and towns. Only then can we dream effectively of our Utopia, because only then do we know the canvas we are working with. This understanding fosters a deeper connection to place which is essential in	1908	2006.408
"He stopped in mid stride, startled. Behind him the match went oiit. "" Damn!"" said Schmidt, and his match box rattled again in his hands. To Von Marx, rooted to his place in the returned darkness, it seemed that near him there was a movement, a shifting of shapes unseen who trod on the soft turf with infinite precaution. The blood tingled suddenly in his face; all that in him was susceptible to the gruesome, to fear of furtive dangers wearing the mask of the night, shrank and failed him. With an awkward, slow motion he passed his right hand across to feel for the hilt of his  358 sword, and he was frozen to immobility again by a low voice that spoke at his side."	"""Do not draw your sword, Von Marx,"" the voice whispered, barely audible over the rustling leaves. ""It will do you no good here."" Von Marx's heart pounded against his ribs, but he obeyed, his hand withdrawing from the weapon's hilt. He strained his ears, trying to locate the source of the voice in the oppressive darkness. ""Who are you?"" he asked, his voice a mix of defiance and fear. ""Merely a friend,"" the voice replied, its tone smooth, almost soothing, but with an underlying sharpness that suggested caution. ""Or perhaps a guardian, depending on how you choose to see it."" Von Marx felt the air shift as if the speaker had moved closer. He fought the urge to step back, his training urging him to face the unknown threat squarely. ""Why should I trust you?"" he challenged, his voice steadier now. ""Because, dear Von Marx, you are currently in far greater danger than you realize, and I am offering you a way out."" The mysterious figure's words were cryptic, yet carried"	1913	1979.0709
(3) If all the new wood is left on the vine it will bear ten times more clusters than it can properly develop, and they will be small and imperfect. (4) If nine-tenths of the new wood is cut away, leaving only from thirty to fifty good buds to each vine, the yield of good grapes will be much increased. (5) It is desirable in severe climates to train the vine so that it can cv be laid down on the ground with but lit,  ered for winter at tie resistance, for in such locations it is  the end of first  year, with extra necessary to protect it each winter. f S orma & tio V nTf th? If these P oints are born in mind  vines is started it matters not so very much what system  is pursued in pruning. However,  it will be found most convenient to adhere somewhat clearly to some simple system of pruning.	(6) One effective method is the cordon system, where the vine is trained along a wire or trellis in a horizontal manner. This allows for easier access to the vine and simplifies the pruning process. By maintaining one or two main arms, known as cordons, which extend from the central trunk, the grower can easily manage the amount of new growth each season. (7) Another common technique is the head pruning system, where the vine is kept short with no permanent arms or cordons. This method is particularly suited for varieties that produce fruit on new wood. The vine essentially becomes a compact bush, with the new growth sprouting directly from the head each year. This method can be especially beneficial in windy or frost-prone areas, as the low profile of the vine reduces exposure to the elements. (8) Regardless of the chosen method, the key to successful pruning lies in the consistent removal of old wood to promote healthy new growth. This not only ensures the production of high-quality fruit but also helps in the prevention of diseases and pests, which are more likely to	1914	1976.6813
"Near Harleston, four miles to the southwest, we came across two of our men whom we had left at Woodbridge, and from them learned that we were at last free of the enemy. Therefore, by three o'clock we were back again in Ipswich, and immediately made report to the adjutant of our regiment, who was anxiously awaiting our return to headquarters. The scene during the night in Ipswich was one of terror and disorder, the worst fears being increased by our report. "" Would Wheeler return ? That was the crucial question."	The townsfolk had gathered in anxious clusters, whispering rumors that swirled like the mist off the Orwell. Women clasped shawls tighter against the chill, their faces drawn with worry as they peered into the darkness for any sign of the missing patrols. Every creak and footstep heightened the tension, every shadow a potential harbinger of doom. As the hours ticked by, the atmosphere grew only more fraught. The local inn, usually a place of raucous laughter and flowing ale, was subdued, its patrons speaking in hushed tones, their eyes darting to the door with each new entry. Men stood in doorways, their expressions grim, muskets at the ready, prepared to defend their homes and families at a moment's notice. Then, just as despair began to settle over Ipswich like a heavy fog, the sound of hooves clattering on cobblestones broke through the night. A cheer erupted as Wheeler and his men rounded the corner into the town square, weary but unbroken. Relief washed over the crowd in palpable waves as families	1906	1978.4496
"Find the ratio between Young's modulus for compression and the modified modulus when lateral expansion in one direction is entirely prevented. Take Poisson's ratio as i . m * 16. If within the elastic limit a bar of steel stretches of its length under simple tension, find the proportional change in volume, Poisson's ratio being J. 17. Three long parallel wires, equal in length and in the same vertical plane, jointly support a load of 30CO lbs. The middle wire is steel, and the two outer ones are brass, and each is J square inch in section. After the wires have been so adjusted as to each carry J of the load a further load of 7000 lbs. is added. Find the stress in each wire, and the fraction of the whole load carried by the steel wire. E for steel 30 x 10"" lbs. per square inch, and for brass 12 x 10° lbs."	To solve the problem, let's start by understanding the situation and breaking down the calculations: **Problem Setup:** - Total initial load = 3000 lbs - Each wire carries 1/3 of the load initially = 3000 lbs / 3 = 1000 lbs per wire - Additional load = 7000 lbs - Total final load = 3000 lbs + 7000 lbs = 10000 lbs - Cross-sectional area of each wire = 1/4 square inch - E (Young's modulus) for steel = 30 x 10^6 lbs per square inch - E for brass = 12 x 10^6 lbs per square inch **Step 1: Calculate the Initial Stress in Each Wire:** Initial stress in each wire = Load / Area = 1000 lbs / (1/4) in² = 4000 lbs/in² **Step 2: Calculate the Total Stress After Adding the Additional Load:** Total load per wire with additional load = 10000 lbs / 3 =	1908	1981.0902
"""What's the matter with Dick?"" he asked, throwing down the wood. ""He's ashamed of himself, "" said the girl. ""He caught a rat this afternoon and had to drop it. He's too old now, I consider."" ""Harrh!"" said Old Vitriol. He tried to stretch his left hand over the stove, but the numbed fingers would not open, and he dropped his arm and looked sidelong at the girl. They sat down to supper together. The wind came jolting and shouldering the house until it seemed as if enormous clods were being thrown at it maliciously. The walls of the house shivered, and stray gusts shook the pots and pans which hung against the bare boards. ""What is that?"" asked the girl, pointing to the box. ""That's a box, "" said Old Vitriol. He opened it, and, taking out the dagger, stuck it into the deal table, where it stood quivering on the delicate, long blade, covered with dark stains."	"The girl stared at the dagger, her eyes wide with a mixture of curiosity and fear. ""Why do you have that?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the howling wind. Old Vitriol leaned back in his chair, his eyes fixed on the trembling blade as if seeing it for the first time. ""It's an old keepsake,"" he muttered, his voice gruff. ""Belonged to a man I once knew. A man of fierce tempers and fierce loyalties. He met a bad end, and this,"" he gestured at the dagger, ""is all that's left of him."" The girl continued to gaze at the dagger, the flickering light from the stove casting eerie shadows on its blade. ""It looks dangerous,"" she said, her voice tinged with a nervous tremor. ""It is,"" Old Vitriol agreed, his eyes never leaving the blade. ""But it's also a reminder. Of choices made, and the paths those choices set us on."" He paused, then added softly, ""Of what happens when we let"	1913	1973.1173
But with the women who would not let their motherhood instinct be dormant, but have mated regardless of economic drawbacks, something should be done without further delay. State pensions for widows with families dependent on their scanty earnings are not yet available, so if we are not capable of dealing with such claims on the community now, it certainly does not give a very promising outlook for .the super children that are to be. Here are two typical cases where I consider a State pension should be forthcoming: — (1) A young, penniless widow was left with four healthy boys, but owing to the sweated wages system of today, she could only earn 123. a week. As a result of her inability to procure maintenance for herself and family, she was forced to let three of the boys be taken into the workhouse while she was allowed to retain the youngest.	(2) Another case involves a widow left with three young daughters. Her husband, a skilled craftsman, died unexpectedly without any savings, leaving her to fend for the family on her own. With limited work opportunities that pay meagerly, she struggles to make ends meet. Despite her best efforts working long hours at a local textile mill, she barely earns enough to cover rent and basic necessities, let alone provide a proper education for her daughters or secure a healthier living condition. In both instances, these women are thrust into dire economic straits through no fault of their own, burdened further by the absence of a supportive safety net. The establishment of state pensions for such widows could provide a crucial lifeline, ensuring that the children are not deprived of a stable home environment and can continue their education, which is vital for breaking the cycle of poverty. Moreover, the state’s intervention would not only alleviate immediate financial hardship but also contribute to the social stability and future economic productivity of these families. It is imperative for the community to recognize and address these pressing needs, reinforcing the social fabric and nurturing	1911	2005.2465

"The Lotus Lantern. MARY IMLAY TAYLOR Author of ""The Reaping, "" ""The Impersonator, "" ""My Lady Clancarty, "" etc. A love story of great charm and dramatic power, whose scene is laid in Japan of today. Lieut. John Holland, a military attache of the British Embassy, and betrothed to the daughter of the British Ambassador, while witnessing the Buddhist festival of lanterns, symbolising ships of the souls of the dead, meets Ume san, who had been sold by her relatives and had become a Geisha girl in a Tokyo tea garden. A plot has been formed to place her in the power of an unscrupulous and cruel Japanese prince. Holland's sympathy is first enlisted, and finally he falls passionately in love with the little Japanese girl, pure, sweet, and devout, notwithstanding her surroundings."	As the festival continues, the night air filled with the soft glow of countless lanterns floating down the stream, Holland’s thoughts are torn between duty and desire. Ume-san, with her delicate grace and haunting eyes, represents a world so different from the one he has pledged himself to with his betrothal. The lanterns, with their gentle sway, seem to echo the tumult of his heart, each one a bearer of souls that whisper to him of love, duty, and destiny. The prince, cunning and relentless, watches Ume-san with predatory interest, planning to ensnare her completely in his web of power. Holland knows he must act swiftly if he is to save her from a fate too cruel to contemplate. His resolve hardens as he watches her perform a traditional dance, her movements telling a story of longing and resilience that pierces his heart. With the help of an old monk who sees the purity of Holland’s intent, a daring plan is hatched to rescue Ume-san during the climax of the festival, under cover of darkness and the chaos of the final celebration	1912	1945.6471
"This white substance, which will be referred to as the ""diamino"" fraction, and which is only slightly soluble in aether, was removed, though not quite completely. It was purified by suspension in aether and centrifuging the suspension; as it is not entirely insoluble in aether this necessarily involves loss. It was then warmed to 45° to 50° in alcohol, filtered from traces of protein, concentratediand treated with acetone. The precipitate, which was not smeary, was washed with acetone and aether, and dried. The yield of this substance, though necessarily in no sense quantitative, amounting to only 075 grm., indicates at any rate that it is present in considerably smaller quantities than those to be described."	The final product, a pale yellowish powder, was analyzed for its amino acid composition. The presence of high amounts of diamino acids confirmed its identity as primarily composed of arginine and lysine. Further characterization involved solubility tests in various solvents, where it showed a marked increase in solubility in water compared to aether, aligning with the typical behavior of polar amino acids. Subsequent experiments aimed to determine the functionality and potential applications of this diamino fraction. Assays for enzymatic activity were conducted, which suggested that the substance might act as a cofactor in certain biochemical pathways. Additionally, its interaction with specific enzymes hinted at a regulatory role in metabolic processes. Given the unique properties of the diamino fraction, further studies are planned to explore its physiological roles in greater detail. These will involve both in vitro and in vivo experiments designed to elucidate its mechanism of action and potential therapeutic benefits. The preliminary data suggests that, despite its minor presence, the diamino fraction could have significant biological implications.	1913	2002.0782
I think if lie were to get into touch with the supply authorities, both in London and in the counties, he would find that the individuals concerned were pretty closely interested in this particular subject. Mr. Willcox also agrees with me that the question of daylight colour value is rather being overdone, and his suggestion of a counter box arranged to give daylight effects for colour matching is quite good. Mr. Justus Eck makes reference to some enclosed arc lamps of American type shown in some of my pictures. I am afraid I cannot locate these, and think lie must be mistaken. I am glad to see that Mr. Eck agrees with me  213 that indirect lighting is the most desirable form of illumination.	He particularly emphasizes the importance of avoiding glare, which can be detrimental not only to the efficiency of workers but also to the general ambiance of a space. Further, he notes the benefits of using diffused lighting to enhance visual comfort and productivity, which aligns with the principles of modern ergonomic and environmental psychology. Mr. Eck also suggests the incorporation of adjustable lighting systems, allowing users to modify intensity and direction according to specific tasks and times of day. This adaptability is crucial in spaces used for multiple purposes or by individuals with varying visual needs. Moreover, he proposes the integration of natural light wherever possible, to reduce energy consumption and improve the psychological and physiological well-being of occupants. This could involve the strategic placement of windows or the use of skylights, coupled with light-sensitive automated systems that adjust artificial lighting based on the amount of natural light available. In conclusion, Mr. Eck's recommendations support a holistic approach to lighting design, which not only considers the functional aspects but also the health and comfort of the end-users. As lighting technology continues to evolve, these considerations will undoubtedly become standard practice in the	1912	2006.8927
Where it was necessary to cross open ground they were dug deep and winding, after the fashion adopted by the Boers in the South African War, so that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to enfilade them. •, s7  288 Special bomb proof covers for the local reserves were also constructed at various points, and the ground in front ruthlessly cleared of houses, barns, trees, hedges, and everything that might afford shelter to an advancing enemy. Every possible military obstacle was placed in front of the lines that time permitted, abattis, military pits, wire entanglements, and small ground mines. At the more important points along the fifty miles of en r General lin cf e, rt ficU redoubt «. Smaller and7ca important ffkt GtOWOt WHUPHftOW.lt trenchments field works and redoubts for infantry and guns were built, most of them being armed with 4.7 or even 6 and 7.5 in.	guns to ensure a formidable defensive capability. The fields of fire were calculated with precision, allowing the defenders optimal range and coverage to repel any assault. These redoubts, often camouflaged with local foliage, were designed to be inconspicuous yet deadly, blending seamlessly into the surrounding landscape until the moment they were needed. Behind the primary defensive positions, secondary lines were established to provide a fallback point in case the front lines were breached. These were equally fortified, though generally with lighter armaments, ensuring that even if the enemy gained some ground, they would still face significant resistance. Communication trenches connected all positions, allowing for swift movement of troops and information without exposing the soldiers to enemy fire. Telephone wires were laid deep underground to ensure uninterrupted communication, a vital component for coordinating defense across such an extended front. The entire network of fortifications was a testament to strategic planning and engineering prowess, designed not only to withstand an attack but to inflict maximum damage on the enemy while preserving the strength of the defending forces. This comprehensive approach to defense ensured that any advancing army would have to pay a high	1906	1993.7926
At the expiration of twenty minutes the German flag still flew over the German works, and it became clear that the enemy did not intend to surrender. Signals were therefore made in the international code that a respite of three and a half hours would be allowed for the civilians, women and children, to quit Lerwick, but that the British warships would forthwith attack the German positions away from the harbour. Four of the smaller destroyers pushed carefully in under Hildesay, searching and sweeping for mines. They were fired upon from the shore, and replied with their 12 pounders, shelling the German works vigorously, but carefully avoiding the town. Apparently the Germans had not mined the waters to the west of the long and narrow peninsula upon which Lerwick stands. Mines were seen at both ends of Bressay Sound, but Deal's Voe seemed to be clear. At noon the Iphigenia steamed inside Hildesay to shell the town and works from the west.	The bombardment began with precision, the Iphigenia's guns thundering in a methodical sequence that sent shells arcing through the sky to crash into the German fortifications. Clouds of smoke and debris rose as the fortifications took direct hits, one after another. The German response was swift but erratic, their artillery unable to match the range and accuracy of the British warship. Meanwhile, on the ground, the evacuation of civilians from Lerwick was carried out with urgency. Men, women, and children, carrying whatever possessions they could, hurried towards the designated safe zones under the supervision of British ground forces. The scene was one of controlled chaos, with the distant sounds of cannon fire serving as a grim reminder of the peril they were escaping. As the last of the civilians were safely away, the British intensified their assault. The destroyers, having confirmed the absence of mines in the immediate area, moved closer to provide more direct support. Their smaller guns were effective against the German infantry positions, suppressing enemy fire as the Iphigenia continued its relentless shelling of the stronger fort	1906	1976.3148
He walked our streets as on a lonely strand: His country was not here — it was afar. Not here his home, not here his motherland, But in some statelier star. Life was his exile, Earth his alien shore, And these were foreign faces that he passed : For he had other language, other lore, And he must home at last. O poet, not for you the trampling street, The wrangling crowd that cry and clutch for gold; And so you followed Beauty's flying feet Into the dim and old. You sang your song: we gave you scorn for pay: For beauty's bread we gave a stone: and yet Because our eyes were held on the way, Remember to forget.	Your voice, a whisper from a distant realm, Spoke truths too deep for our shallow streams to overwhelm. You traced the outlines of a world more fair, Where truth and beauty breathed a purer air. In verses wrought from solitude and pain, You sought to lift our sights with your refrain. A lonely beacon on a darkened plain, Your words a balm, a solace to our strain. Though here your steps were heavy, laden, slow, Within your heart did golden visions glow. You saw beyond the veil, the mist, the night, You saw the soul's homeland, bathed in light. O poet, though the world was deaf to hear, Your song endures, transcending transient sneer. In libraries of silence, halls of thought, Your starry homeland is forever sought. The march of time, the fleeting crowd's applause, Cannot confine your spirit to its laws. For you have touched the everlasting flame, And in that light, all earthly praise is tame. So rest, sweet bard, from labor now be free, Your journey's end is	1911	1897.3678
The other thousand feet of water which continues down the canal will develop about seven hundred horse power more. All the power developed at these various stations is brought together to the central station and then distributed as required to all parts of the valley. The city of Phoenix uses about two thousand horse power. Some power is transferred to the Pima Indian Reservation, near Sacaton, where it pumps water for ten thousand acres of land belonging to the Indians. Part of the power is used at Mesa for pumping water from a number of wells to irrigate from twenty to forty thousand acres. Further west, in the country of wells round about Tempe, other pumping plants will be installed which will serve a double purpose.	Firstly, they will provide the necessary irrigation to ensure that the agricultural output of the region remains consistent and productive throughout the year, regardless of the natural variability in rainfall. Secondly, the plants will supply domestic water to the local communities, thus addressing the critical need for reliable water resources in this arid region. This dual functionality not only maximizes the utility of the power generated but also promotes sustainable development by integrating agricultural and community water needs. As these initiatives expand, the scope of the power distribution will also grow to include other agricultural projects and potentially, in the future, small-scale industrial applications. This would further catalyze economic development in the region, creating jobs and improving living standards for the local population. The strategic use of this hydroelectric power underscores a broader commitment to utilizing natural resources responsibly and innovatively to meet diverse needs while fostering environmental stewardship.	1911	2003.9695
Just the remoteness of the material adds to the intensity of the training; and on the other hand even the most indifferent sentence in which the grammar is learned will become living, if the right teacher teaches it, as he will always keep before the pupil's mind the decisive fact that it is a language which has made our civilization. The more a man is called by his vocation to be a leader in his sphere, the more the highest interests of the nation demand that he see the historical world in which he acts with reference to the decisive influences. It would therefore be shortsighted indeed to eliminate an intimate acquaintance with Greek or Latin from the formative years of those who seek the higher professions. All this in no way reduces the important cultural  295   mission of the modern foreign languages. If they are well taught, their disciplinary value for the training not only of memory and attention but of reasoning, of imitation, of judgement, of automatic activity, of observation, truly lies in the direction of the best education.	Moreover, the practical utility of modern languages in today’s globalized world cannot be underestimated. The ability to communicate effectively across cultures is increasingly seen as a vital skill in both professional and personal realms. As trade, diplomacy, and international collaborations continue to grow, the relevance of languages such as French, German, Spanish, and Mandarin only escalates. Each language offers a unique window into a different culture, a different way of thinking, and different historical contexts, enriching a student’s global perspective and enhancing their adaptability in diverse environments. Yet, the classical languages—Latin and Greek—provide foundational knowledge that underpins much of Western literature, philosophy, legal systems, and scientific terminology. The analytical skills developed through the study of Latin grammar and the rhetorical skills honed by translating complex Greek texts are immensely beneficial. These languages train the mind to recognize patterns, to understand the roots of complex words, and to appreciate the precision in communication. Thus, while the direct applicational benefits of modern languages are clear, the intellectual rigor and cultural depth offered by classical studies are equally indispensable. Both disciplines contribute uniquely to	1909	2007.292
Unless a remedy is found the evil will lead to a national disaster. The way to cure an evil is not to modify or lessen its effect, but to remove the cause producing the evil. Therefore the remedy for high prices is to remove the unnatural and arbitrary causes that affect the market. This demands legislative action prohibiting the following things: Speculation for unearned wealth; limiting the output of industries, or wasting or destroying goods and products, or withholding them from the market in order to affect prices; and any other practice that would prevent the operation of the law of supply and demand. Furthermore, a government commission should establish the prices on the necessities of life according to the supply and the demand. Such a commission would foster healthy business and give uniformity and stability to the market.	In addition to these measures, it would be prudent to enhance transparency in the operations of key industries, particularly those that deal with essential commodities. Public access to information regarding production volumes, storage levels, and planned releases of goods into the market can prevent manipulation and ensure that the market operates based on genuine supply and demand dynamics. Moreover, the establishment of fair trade practices must be enforced rigorously to prevent monopolies and cartels from forming. These entities often restrict competition and manipulate prices to their advantage, which distorts the market and harms consumers. Anti-trust laws should be strengthened and applied consistently to break up monopolistic structures and promote a healthy competitive environment. Educational campaigns to inform consumers about their rights and about how market mechanisms work could also empower them to make informed decisions. This, coupled with strengthened consumer protection laws, would ensure that consumers are not unfairly treated or misled by businesses. Finally, fostering alternative sources and encouraging local production can mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on specific suppliers or imported goods. This approach not only supports local economies but also buffers national markets against global price volatility and supply	1911	1996.0126
Most scientific investigators are imitative, contributing to detail but setting no new landmark on the horizon. Now and then, however, a man of keener imagination and clearer mental vision sees a new and attractive region for exploration and blazes a trail. Sometimes the new field is reached after great effort, sometimes only an easy ridge has to be crossed. Others at once follow his leadership, clearing, mapping, describing and illustrating. The work of both is essential, but the one we honour as an explorer and the other we respect as a surveyor. Most men of science are surveyors merely.	They carefully measure and record, refining and expanding upon the groundwork laid by their more visionary predecessors. Theirs is the task of methodical analysis and diligent accumulation of data, the steady expansion of our understanding within the established borders of knowledge. Yet the explorer, with an eye for the unseen and a heart for the unknown, challenges the boundaries that confine human understanding. He ventures into uncharted territories, driven by the lure of discovery and the promise of new insights.  This explorer's instinct to push beyond the known world and redefine the limits of what is possible remains the driving force behind scientific revolution. It is the rare spark that ignites progress and inspires entire fields to evolve. While the surveyor fortifies the edifice of science with bricks of fact and beams of detail, the explorer lays the foundation for new edifices to rise. Both roles are indispensable—the explorer for his audacity to dream and the surveyor for his dedication to reality. Together, they embody the dual spirit of scientific endeavor: the pursuit of truth through the balance of imagination and rigor.	1911	1991.0154
The vast rock stratum of coarse conglomerate, hundreds of feet thick, has trembled and separated into vast blocks, often showing a straight, smooth cleavage like the side of a cathedral. As a matter of fact, I suppose there was no voice of the thunder or of earthquake that wrought this ruin, but the still, small voice of heat and cold and rain and snow. There is no wild turmoil or look of decrepitude, but a look of repose and tranquillity. The enormous four square fragments of the mountain stand a few feet apart, as if carefully Juarried for a tower to reach the skies, n classic simplicity and strength, in harmony and majesty of outline, in dignity and serenity of aspect, I do not know their equal. What a diverse family is this of the stratified rocks!	Each layer tells its own story of ancient seas, rivers, or windswept deserts, of epochs when the world was young and life was burgeoning in forms strange and wonderful. Here in these colossal fragments, we see the evidence of eons of erosion, the slow but irresistible force of nature that carves and molds the earth's surface. The layers, each distinct in mineral composition and color, stack atop one another, revealing a timeline of the planet's geological history that is both intricate and majestic. As we stand before these towering relics, we are reminded of the relentless passage of time and the transient nature of existence. These rocks have witnessed the rise and fall of species, the shifting of continents, and the dramatic climatic changes that have shaped the world as we know it. The tranquility they now exhibit belies the dynamic and often violent processes that have led to their current form. It is this juxtaposition of peace and power, of the serene and the monumental, that imbues these geological formations with a profound beauty. The grandeur of these natural sculptures, shaped not by the hands	1913	2006.4698
"A Maryland act provided that the children of a servant woman resulting from intermarriage with a negro slave should be slaves to her master for life. But since unprincipled masters urged the marriage of their servant women to slaves, the law was repealed. Nevertheless, miscegenation continued. It is obvious that the economic significance of the white servant was very important. Benjamin Franklin said in 1759, ""The labour of the plantations is performed chiefly by indentured servants brought from Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany, because the high price it bears cannot be performed in any other way."" Free labour on a wage system was impossible, because of both high wages and scarcity of labour. Few would work for hire when land could be had for almost nothing. The certainty of supply, the power of control, its economy, and the large profits resulting, made the system superior to other forms until the negro slave was imported on a large scale."	The transition from indentured servitude to African slavery was gradual but definitive, driven by economic calculations and racial attitudes that solidified over time. As the colonies grew and the demand for labor increased, it became increasingly clear to plantation owners that the indenture system, while initially effective, was not sustainable for the kind of perpetual labor force they desired. The limitations of the indenture system, particularly the finite nature of the contracts and the rights that indentured servants held, made it less appealing compared to the enslavement of Africans who were forcibly brought and held in perpetual servitude. The introduction of African slaves also shifted the social hierarchy and racial dynamics within the colonies. The racialization of slavery, where blackness became synonymous with enslavement and whiteness with freedom, was a deliberate choice that benefited the colonial elite both economically and socially. By creating a distinct, racial underclass, the elites ensured a stable and controlled labor force while simultaneously preventing solidarity between indentured servants and enslaved Africans. The legal frameworks that supported slavery expanded and became more stringent, providing a robust mechanism for control and exploitation.	1913	1990.9121
When we talk of the birth, maturity, and old age of nations we use a biological analogy which is as apt to mislead as to instruct. Nations are, of course, historical products which have their rise and fall in time, Sometimes we are able to date the birth of a nation from a combination of striking events which awakened a consciousness of common interests and destiny amongst a people. But more commonly the national spirit arises without observation, the product of many forces acting through long periods of time, so that the birth of the nation cannot be even approximately dated. Whether we are to call it old or young at any given time will depend on an arbitrary decision as to the most fitting period for beginning to describe the people as a nation; and on this arbitrary decision it will also depend whether at some subsequent period it will be possible for the nation to be suffering from decadence.	The analogy of maturity and decadence, borrowed from the life of biological organisms, must therefore be used with caution when applied to nations. Nations do not grow old in the same sense that individuals do. Their vitality and capacity for renewal can persist indefinitely, influenced by external circumstances, internal reforms, and the continuous evolution of ideas, culture, and social structures. The conditions that lead to the decline of nations are usually complex and multifaceted, involving economic difficulties, political instability, loss of moral and ideological direction, or external pressures and conflicts. Thus, the life cycle of a nation is not predetermined or fixed, and the idea of inevitable decline following maturity is a misapplication of biological principles. Nations can undergo periods of rejuvenation and resurgence, as new generations and leaders bring fresh perspectives and solutions to old problems. It is also possible for nations to transform themselves through revolutions—social, political, or technological—that redefine their identities and trajectories.  Therefore, while the metaphor of life stages can help us conceptualize the historical development of nations, we must remember that unlike biological beings, nations are complex systems capable	1908	1977.5245
Enclosing walls are carried up around the entire village when trouble threatens, but such defences are allowed to crumble in times of peace. The chief supply of water will generally be taken from a well outside the village. Thus Farafra, one of the most slowly changing of the oases, comprises a single solid cluster of mud houses, a separate structure serving as a monastery for a group of Senoussi converts, a date orchard divided into several private holdings, with minute gardens, and a small wheat field, the total area under cultivation being about half a square mile. The population numbers less than four hundred, and the ratio of one inhabitant per acre may be taken as a safe basis for estimating the number of inhabitants in such places. The small supply of rough forage supports a definitely limited number of sheep, turkeys, and donkeys.	The life in Farafra, as in many other remote villages, follows a rhythm set by the seasons and the demands of subsistence agriculture. The locals are well-adapted to the harsh, arid environment, using traditional methods handed down through generations to extract the most from their limited resources. The architecture of the village is characterized by thick mud walls which provide insulation against the scorching daytime heat and the cold desert nights. Roofs are often flat, utilized by residents in the evenings for sleeping under the stars, or for drying fruits and grains. Social structure in the village is tightly knit, with family and community ties being strong and central to daily life. The village elder, often a position passed down through familial lines, plays a critical role in resolving disputes and making decisions that affect the community. Religious and social gatherings are held at the monastery, which acts as a spiritual center and a communal meeting place. Agriculture and animal husbandry form the backbone of the economy. Date palms, requiring minimal water, are a staple crop and a significant source of food and income. The small	1913	1998.4238
Since the stresses on opposite sides of the neutral surface are of opposite sign or kind, they may be represented as at aeb. 62. Position of the Neutral Axis. — The beam has been supposed subjected to pure couples only, and therefore the portion, say, to the left of the section AB (Figs and 75), being in equilibrium under one Fig. 75.  io externally applied couple and the forces acting across AB, these forces must exert a couple balancing the external one in the plane of bending. The (vertical) shearing force being nil, the internal forces exerted across AB are wholly horizontal (or longitudinal), and since they form a couple the total tensile forces must balance the compressive ones, ie. the algebraic sum of the horizontal internal forces must, like the external ones, be zero. Putting this statement in symbols we can find the Fig. 76. position of the neutral axis. The cross section of the beam in Fig. 74 is symmetrical about a horizontal axis, but this is not necessary to the argument. Taking any other cross sections symmetrical about the plane of bending YY, as in Fig.	76, we can apply the same principles. Let us consider a beam section that is not symmetrical, for example, an I-beam. In this case, the neutral axis does not necessarily coincide with the geometric center of the section due to the varying distribution of material across the section. To determine the position of the neutral axis, we must consider the moment of area about the neutral axis being equal to zero. This is based on the principle that the sum of the moments of the areas above the neutral axis must equal the sum of the moments of the areas below the neutral axis, as there is no net bending moment about the neutral axis. Mathematically, this can be represented as: \[ \int_A y \, dA = 0 \] where \(y\) is the distance from the neutral axis to a differential area \(dA\) of the cross-section, and the integral is taken over the entire cross-sectional area \(A\). The position of the neutral axis is determined by the distribution of material and the shape of the cross-section, and it is the axis	1908	1985.8264
[Since writing this paper, the report of a Committee on Illumination presented before the Association of Railway Electrical Engineers in Chicago has been issued, and an abstract of this occurs in The Electrical World (Dec. 2nd), from which I may quote a few passages which are of interest in connexion with this paper: — Yards. — The, properties of a lamp chosen for this class of work should be good distribution, reliable action, and a colour of light suitable for penetrating smoke, fog, c. The flame lamp, with its penetrating yellow flame and high efficiency, lends itself admirably for the purpose. The development of the long life electrodes has added an impetus to the adoption of this typo of lamp. Large type tungsten filament lamps are now developed that, used under suitable reflectors, are also useful for this class of work. The unit should be suspended high in order to avoid decreasing the ability of the eye to see and to eliminate shadows between cars.	Platforms. — For platform illumination, the demand is for a light that is both clear and evenly spread to ensure safety and comfort for passengers. Here, the widespread adoption of mercury vapor lamps has proven beneficial. These lamps provide a bright, white light that enhances visibility without the harsh glare associated with older incandescent bulbs. The use of modern lighting technologies also allows for better control of light spill, ensuring that light is directed only where it is needed, thereby reducing light pollution and increasing energy efficiency. Waiting Rooms. — In waiting areas, where the comfort of passengers is paramount, the choice of lighting should contribute to a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The introduction of LED technology has revolutionized this aspect of station illumination. LEDs can be tuned to a range of color temperatures, allowing for customization of lighting atmospheres from warm whites, mimicking incandescent lamps, to cooler whites that resemble daylight. Additionally, LEDs are more energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan, which significantly reduces maintenance and replacement costs. Overall, the advancement in lighting technologies offers considerable improvements in energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and comfort across	1912	2006.1354
We can now say that just as knowledge and activity belong inseparably together in the human mind, psychological ties connect activity and inspiration no less. It is that intimate psychological relation between will and emotion which makes it necessary that every new enthusiasm shall give strength and impulse to the activity and really make the training profitable. No learning and no training of the human mind counts, if it does not find an emotional willingness. The richer the inspiration, the deeper the self development. Accordingly the school should secure a curriculum in which the formal training and the formal knowledge are acquired as far as possible on important subject matter and where enthusiasm and inspiration, too, are gained as far as possible with material which is in itself valuable as source of useful information and as opportunity for training. Intellect, emotion, and will must, therefore, be respected in their in  263   terrelation, if a real economy of studies is to be reached.	The ideal educational system would thus be one that does not merely equip the pupil with dates and facts, but rather one that stimulates thinking, evokes genuine interest, and inspires a love for learning. The methods of teaching should be such that they not only convey knowledge but also cultivate the powers of reasoning, imagination, and judgment. This can be achieved by incorporating into the curriculum activities that are not only intellectually stimulating but also emotionally fulfilling. Moreover, educators must understand and leverage the natural curiosity and enthusiasm of students. By connecting lessons to real-world applications and showing the relevance of what is being taught, students are more likely to be engaged and motivated. This approach not only makes learning more enjoyable but also more meaningful, as students see the practical value of their education. Furthermore, it is essential to foster an environment that encourages exploration and creativity. This can be done by providing opportunities for students to undertake projects and research on topics of personal interest, promoting collaborative learning, and allowing for critical discussions. Such an environment not only nurtures a student's intellectual faculties but also builds confidence and social skills. In conclusion, the	1909	1976.8317

On the other hand, there are in this great city, as in all our mighty centres of life, thousands of girls and young women who are employed in various manufacturing enterprises, offices and great stores. Many of these have left the farm or have come from the barren  196 Provinces hungering for more than can be found in the narrow life of extreme poverty in which they were born. Many of these girls, like their sisters in the educational institutions, cherish ambitious dreams. All are urged on by the hope of bettering their conditions.	They face the challenges of the city with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, often finding themselves in a whirl of new experiences, surrounded by the noise and ceaseless activity that define urban existence. These young women work long hours, often in cramped conditions, but driven by the promise of independence and the possibility of economic advancement.  Their lives are a testament to resilience, as they navigate the complexities of city life, from managing their finances on meager wages to finding affordable housing in neighborhoods that are safe yet accessible to their places of work. Amidst this, they also seek to maintain social connections, forming bonds with fellow workers and participating in community events, which provide a necessary respite from their daily toils. Moreover, many of these young women take night classes or engage in self-study, determined to acquire new skills and knowledge that could open up better employment opportunities. Their ambition is not just to survive, but to thrive, to transform their lives in ways that were unimaginable in the restricted environments from which they came. Yet, the path is not without its hardships. The strain of	1911	2007.2283
"Briefly, with the burner operating on the higher pressures, the luminous tube becomes very hot, and the cold mercury from the electrode entering the tube produces an intense vaporisation. This raises the pressure to such a value as to form an arc, which requires a voltage higher than that of the line pressure. This theory is confirmed by the fact that the "" critical point "" of a 110 volt burner, which is 95 volts when operating on a line pressure of 110 volts, exceeds 120 volts when operating on a 220 volt supply. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the light emitted by a 220 volt burner in a vertical plane passing through the axis ; a portion of the light is obstructed by the lower portion of the electrodes. A New Form of Mercury Vapour Lamp. IN a recent number of the Elektro technische Zeitschrijt* Dr. J. Pole gives an interesting account of the new form of "" orthochromatic "" mercury vapour lamp introduced by the Cooper Hewitt Electric Co. in the United States, to whose courtesy we are indebted for the illustrations accompanying this article."	The new lamp is designed to produce a light more closely resembling daylight, making it particularly suitable for photographic studios and industries where color discrimination is crucial. Dr. Pole explains that the lamp utilizes a special quartz envelope which allows the emission of UV light, previously filtered out in conventional mercury vapor lamps. This UV light, when combined with the visible spectrum emitted by the lamp, results in a light quality that enhances color contrast and clarity. Furthermore, the Cooper Hewitt Electric Co. has developed a unique phosphor coating inside the lamp's tube. This coating absorbs some of the UV radiation and re-emits it as visible light, further adjusting the color temperature and improving the color rendering index of the lamp. According to Dr. Pole, this advancement not only improves the aesthetic quality of the light but also increases the efficiency of the lamp by converting more of the electrical energy into usable light. The design also incorporates a more refined electrode system that minimizes the degradation of the electrodes and extends the life of the lamp. This new system allows for a more stable arc, which is critical in maintaining consistent light output throughout the	1912	2002.2526
The peril of the nation was now recognised on every hand. Eager millions poured into the City by every train from the suburbs and towns in the vicinity of the metropolis, anxious to ascertain the truth for themselves, pale with terror, wild with excitement, indignant  that our land forces were not already mobilised and ready to move eastward to meet the invader. As soon as the banks were opened there was a run on them, but by noon the Bank of England had suspended all specie payments. The other banks, being thus unable to meet their engagements, simply closed the doors, bringing business to an abrupt standstill. Consols stood at 90 on Saturday, but by noon on Monday were down to 42 — lower even than they were in 1798, when they stood at 47J.	The streets were filled with agitated crowds, clamoring for news and demanding action. Newsboys darted through the throngs, their cries adding to the cacophony as they hawked the latest editions with headlines that screamed of impending doom. The government, caught unawares by the scale of the public reaction, struggled to maintain order and reassure the populace.  In the House of Commons, emergency sessions were called, with members of Parliament rushing back to London from their constituencies. The Prime Minister delivered a grave address, urging calm and outlining the steps the government was taking to secure the nation. Meanwhile, military officials were seen entering and exiting the War Office at a frenetic pace, maps and plans under their arms, as they prepared for a defense strategy. Telegraph offices were besieged by people desperate to send messages to loved ones or to receive some word from those in more directly threatened areas. The air was thick with rumors and speculation; every fresh report seemed only to add to the sense of crisis. Amidst this turmoil, community leaders and clergy tried to provide solace and	1906	1972.8112
But the stars were noble, and so bright that in their dim light wc could see the loom of the distant mountains. Punts had told us peremptorily to go to bed. But of course we did not go and could not have gone; that was beyond our natures. For a long while we sat on the railroad track, where we could see the shadows flit back and forth against Sarah Clarke's drawn window shades as Punts and little Smith Mudd moved about inside. And we could also see Bradford as he strode inexorably up and down on the only piece of lawn that then existed for miles and miles. Sometimes Miss Nellie Caylor's white skirt winked on and off on the station plat  Drawn by W. Herbert Dunlon hall tone plate engraved by H.

Sometimes a distinguishable voice rose from the party in Jan Havland's or from that on the steps of the Breeze office. Once an extra train from Spokane came roaring through without stopping, shaking the earth and pulling a little gale of wind with it. There by the railroad we continued sitting for hours.	The cool air of the night wrapped around us like a shawl, and the distant hoot of an owl occasionally broke the silence. The stars seemed to grow even brighter as the night deepened, their twinkling forms a stark contrast against the deep velvet of the sky. Occasionally, the distant laughter or a snippet of conversation from the gatherings nearby would drift over to us, mingling with the soft rustling of the grass and the occasional crunch of gravel underfoot as one of us shifted position. Bradford's pacing eventually slowed, and he seemed to settle on a particular spot, his silhouette barely discernible in the dim starlight. Miss Nellie Caylor's skirt no longer flitted across the platform, suggesting she had finally joined one of the nearby groups or perhaps gone inside. As the hours passed, a sense of timelessness enveloped us. The world outside our small gathering by the railroad tracks might as well have ceased to exist. We were in our own little bubble, connected by the shared experience of the night, the stars, and our youthful disregard for sleep. Eventually,	1913	1993.6744
In the time of harvest it is the veritable land of the Hesperides, for the golden orange is a ball of rich and delicious nectar fit for the gods. Figures will give a little idea as to what Redlands means to the United States. Last year its crop of oranges totaled enough to give to every man, woman and child of the hundred millions of the country four oranges apiece. From November twenty third to September eleventh, 4,721 carloads, containing 1,680,986 boxes, were  403 shipped of oranges and lemons from her packing houses. Forty years ago the whole valley could have been bought for a few thousand dollars — indeed, was so bought. today the assessed valuation is eight million dollars, which means a real valuation of not less than twenty-five millions. How came all this to pass? Climate, soil, the industry of man, and, above all, water. Without water Redlands County today would revert to the condition of forty years ago.	The transformation began earnestly with the introduction of extensive irrigation systems, which harnessed the natural water flows and directed them to the thirsty groves. Enterprising settlers and farmers, recognizing the potential of the fertile land under a benevolent sun, invested in the infrastructure necessary to turn arid lands into a verdant agricultural haven. As the orchards flourished and the reputation of Redlands' citrus grew, more settlers arrived, drawn by the promise of prosperity. This growth was bolstered by the arrival of the railroad, which provided a direct link to markets across the country. Suddenly, the oranges and lemons grown in Redlands could be found on dinner tables in distant cities, enchanting palates with their freshness and quality. The establishment of cooperative packing houses further streamlined the process, ensuring that the fruit was carefully handled, packed, and shipped, maintaining its pristine condition from tree to table. The economic boom transformed the landscape not just agriculturally but also culturally and socially. Schools, churches, and businesses sprang up, supported by the wealth generated from the orchards. Civic pride grew strong	1911	1946.3318
Humidity varies from point to point and sometime extremely; temperature also changes abruptly, and often more erratically than humidity. Temperature measurement is, however, comparatively easy and accurate compared to humidity analysis of the air. TEMPERATURE VARIATION WITH ALTITUDE. — In Figure 18, an observer and his assistant in a balloon equipped with a thermometer record the temperature as they ascend. In the basket, they have a chart with altitude in one column, as on the left of the figure, and a column in which to record temperature, as on the right of the figure. The as  32 sistant has before him a graph sheet as shown at the lower part of the figure, whereon he plots the temperature against the altitude as they are recorded. A graphical record of altitude and temperature shows that the temperature decreased at practically a constant rate from the ground to 5000 feet. From 5000 feet to 6000 feet the two u I R Figure 19.	observers note a slight stabilization in the temperature curve, suggesting a temporary thermal layer where temperature variation is minimal. Beyond 6000 feet, the decrease in temperature resumes its prior rate until reaching 10,000 feet. Here, another plateau appears, marked by a brief increase in temperature, possibly due to a minor inversion layer where warmer air is trapped above cooler air beneath it. This phenomenon is not uncommon in atmospheric studies and can significantly affect local weather patterns.  Continuing their ascent, the temperature again begins to decrease as they pass through 12,000 feet, adhering to the normal lapse rate expected in the troposphere. The graph that the assistant meticulously plots provides a clear visual representation of these shifts, with a line that zigzags slightly but generally trends downward as the altitude increases. This visual aid is not only crucial for their current observations but will also be valuable for comparative analysis with future or past data collected under similar conditions.  By the time they reach 15,000 feet, the temperature has dropped significantly, underlining the direct relationship between altitude and temperature in the lower layers	1913	2004.4532

"""After the terrific struggle in Marylebone three days ago, Von Kronhelm saw plainly that if London were to rise en mass she would at once assume the upper hand. The German commander-in-chief had far too many points to guard. On the west of London he was threatened by Lord By field and hosts of auxiliaries, mostly sworn members of the National League of Defenders ; on the south, across the river, Southwark, Lambeth, and Battersea formed an impregnable fortress, containing over a million eager patriots ready to burst forth and sweep away the vain, victorious army; while within central London itself the spirit of revolt was rife, and the people were ready to rise at any moment. The train is laid. Only the spark is required to cause an explosion."	Von Kronhelm, in his headquarters, pondered deeply over his maps and reports. The situation was dire. He knew the strategic importance of holding London, but the city's vast expanse and fervent population presented a challenge unlike any he had encountered. The streets were a labyrinth, and every corner could become a potential flashpoint of rebellion. His forces, though well-trained and formidable, were stretched thin, maintaining order and securing key locations against a populace that seemed to multiply with every passing hour. The German commander knew he had to act decisively. Any hesitation could give the insurgents the opportunity they needed to coordinate and launch a city-wide uprising that could overwhelm his troops. He decided to reinforce the most vulnerable points, particularly those on the western and southern fronts, where the threat seemed most imminent. Additional regiments were dispatched to fortify positions along the Thames, and patrols were increased to maintain a visible presence that he hoped would deter any potential rebels. Yet, Von Kronhelm was also aware that mere military might would not be enough to quell the spirit of resistance that had taken hold of	1906	1982.9923

"The variation of drift with wind speed was investigated for the BE, body in the symmetrical position, ie., with pitching angle and angle of yaw both zero. Experiments were also made to determine the effect, on the flow of the method of holding the model. In the experiment as finally conducted it was found that the effect of the spindle on the model, and model on spindle, was too small to be measured. The forces and moments have been transferred in both bodies to a point in the neighbourhood of the CG. of the full scale machine. The actual position of the point of reference in each body is shown in Fig. 12. In the case where the angle of yaw is varied, the forces given are the ""longitudinal force"" which is parallel to the line fixed in the boay, and the "" lateral force"" which is perpendicular to the plane of symmetry."	These results were obtained by mounting the model on a precision balance capable of measuring the smallest shifts in force direction and magnitude. The balance was aligned such that the longitudinal force directly corresponded to the axis of the airflow, ensuring accurate measurements even at higher speeds and varying angles. The lateral force measurements were particularly crucial for understanding the stability and control characteristics of the BE body under different wind conditions. Further, the experiments incorporated various wind speeds to simulate real-life scenarios, ranging from gentle breezes equivalent to low flight speeds up to gale-force winds mimicking high-speed flight conditions. This range allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the aerodynamic performance and stability of the model at different velocities. Data from these tests were plotted against the angle of yaw and wind speed to create a series of curves that illustrated the relationship between these variables and the aerodynamic forces acting on the model. These curves revealed critical points where changes in yaw angle could lead to sudden increases in lateral forces, potentially impacting the stability and control of the full-scale machine. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were run parallel to the physical experiments	1912	1998.6234

"They had bagged four Germans, however, and their commanding officer was furious. It was a pity that it happened, as it could not possibly have been of any use. But it seems that Shand had no idea that it was more than a very small detachment that had landed from a gunboat that someone said they had seen down the river. Some of the Volunteers were captured afterwards and sent off as prisoners, and the Germans posted up a notice that all Volunteers were forthwith to surrender either themselves or their arms and uniforms, under pain of death. Most of them did the latter. They could do nothing after it was found that the Germans had a perfect army somewhere between Maldon and the sea, and were pouring troops into the town as fast as they could. """	The situation grew increasingly dire as the days passed. The small band of Volunteers, now bereft of their arms and much of their morale, felt the oppressive weight of occupation. The town itself, once a bustling hub of local activity, had transformed into a somber place, the streets patrolled by German soldiers who watched the residents with hawk-like vigilance. Every corner of Maldon seemed to echo with the heavy boots of the occupying force, their presence a constant reminder of the town's subdued state. The local populace, initially defiant, gradually succumbed to the reality of their situation, their spirited conversations replaced by hushed whispers of discontent and fear. Amidst this atmosphere of despair, a few brave souls began to whisper about resistance. Secret meetings were held under the cover of darkness, in the back rooms of loyal establishments or in the quiet of the surrounding woods. Plans were cautiously crafted, not just to reclaim their town but to send a message of defiance and hope to other occupied areas. These were dangerous thoughts, and even more dangerous actions, but the fire of resistance, once kind	1906	1976.3682
"There are two other guides First, as stated above, the scroll and foliage element was derived from Frankish artists, who developed this style in the ' Carolingian Renaissance.' Secondly, the pictorial element (with the characteristic interlaced dragons or serpents) is a product of Scandinavian influence, and dates from the settlement and conversion of the Danes. These will help a great deal in determining the probable age of stones which bear no inscriptions whatever. We have already disposed of the two most notable crosses which have been assigned to the seventh century. Let us examine the evidence for assigning other interlaced crosses to a period preceding the ninth century, when, as already noted, the interlaced ornament makes its first appearance on stone in Ireland.

Although some earlier claims positioned it in the seventh century, more recent analysis aligns it more closely with the Anglo-Saxon period of the eighth century. This re-dating is supported by stylistic comparisons with other contemporaneous works and by linguistic analysis of the inscriptions. The presence of both Latin and runic inscriptions suggests a cultural intersection that would be more plausible in the later period, following the initial Viking incursions and intermingling with the local populace. Further, the detailed iconography of the Ruthwell Cross, which includes scenes from the life of Christ as well as the depiction of the allegorical “Vine-scroll”, aligns with the Christian iconographic programs of the eighth century, rather than the more aniconic art of earlier periods. This supports the theory that such crosses were not only religious symbols but also teaching tools, reflecting a time when Christianity was firmly established and spreading through didactic visuals.

"For example, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer so clearly pointed out, unless provision were made to have all the legitimate expenses involved in the taking of referendum votes paid out of the state treasury, the adoption of this reform would be the means of putting a new political weapon into the hands of the party with the largest campaign fund. Moreover, it must be apparent to every intelligent and disinterested voter, that until some arrangement has been perfected for giving local self-government, generally called ""Home Rule, "" to England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, any attempt to incorporate the principle of the referendum into the British Constitution is not only premature but absurd."	The complexities of regional interests and the varied political climates across these nations necessitate a clear framework for autonomy before a national referendum process can be uniformly applied. This would ensure that all regions have a voice tailored to their unique contexts, rather than being overshadowed or generalized by broader national policies. As it stands, the integration of a referendum without such preliminary steps could exacerbate regional disparities and fuel discontent, undermining the very democracy it seeks to enhance. Furthermore, the Chancellor emphasized the need for a robust educational campaign to accompany any implementation of the referendum system. The electorate must be thoroughly informed about the issues at hand to make knowledgeable decisions that reflect the will of an enlightened populace, rather than the mere whims of the moment. This educational initiative would require substantial investment and careful planning to ensure its effectiveness across diverse communities, further underscoring the necessity of state-funded operations in the referendum process. In conclusion, while the principle of direct democracy through referenda is appealing, it must be approached with meticulous preparation and consideration of the unique political and regional dynamics within the United Kingdom. Only through such measured steps can we hope to	1911	1996.6276
For the torque measurement two methods are used, in one of which liquid transmission is employed, while the other is electrical. The speed of the carriage is also checked by registering electrically the time taken over a fixed distance. The maximum speed in these tests was 19 to 20 ms. This was limited by the length of the track (1,360 m ), not by the air resistance and frictional forces; it was necessary to cut off the current and apply the brake before the maximum speed attainable had been reached.	To further analyze the performance at different speeds, a series of incremental speed tests were conducted. Each increment allowed the vehicle to reach a higher speed before the current was cut and brakes were applied. This method provided a more detailed view of the acceleration curve and helped to discern at which point air resistance and frictional forces began to dominate the performance of the carriage. The torque measurement tools were calibrated before each test to ensure accuracy. The liquid transmission method involved a hydraulic system where the torque applied to the wheels was transmitted through a fluid, and the pressure changes in the fluid were measured to calculate the torque. Meanwhile, the electrical method used strain gauges attached directly to the drive shaft. These gauges measured the deformation of the shaft as torque was applied, which was then converted into an electrical signal that could be quantified. These methods not only provided a redundancy in measurement but also allowed cross-verification of the data, increasing the reliability of the results. The integration of these systems with the speed measurement through electrical timing provided a comprehensive dataset that was crucial for optimizing the performance characteristics of the vehicle.  Additionally,	1912	1975.066
"So that gas is not now simply burnt to produce light of itself directly, but through another medium; and I am almost tempted to go a step further and claim a very fine block of shops on our area as an example of "" Shop Lighting by Gas, "" as in that case the medium used to transfer the heat energy of the gas into light is merely a gas engine, a dynamo, and a set of best electric lamps. After all, what does it matter whether the medium be one substance or another, so long as the primary agent is the same ?"	Indeed, the principle remains unchanged. It is the conversion of one form of energy into another—gas into mechanical energy, and then into electrical energy, which finally manifests as light. This process exemplifies the remarkable versatility of gas as an energy source, adapting it to modern technological advancements that favor electricity. The beauty of such systems lies in their efficiency and adaptability. By utilizing gas in this way, we harness a traditional fuel for contemporary needs, marrying old energy forms with new technology. This is not merely a technical achievement but also an economic one, as it allows for the continuation of existing gas infrastructures with modern energy demands. Moreover, this method of using gas to power electric lighting allows for greater control over the intensity and distribution of light, which is particularly beneficial in a commercial setting such as a block of shops. The ability to finely tune the lighting according to the specific needs of each shop can enhance the aesthetic appeal of merchandise and the overall shopping experience. Thus, while the medium may change, the underlying principle of energy transformation remains a constant, a testament to the enduring utility of gas in an	1912	1988.1522
"He picked up the little vial, turned it to the light, studied its finely printed label, and looked sharply over toward the divan. She was watching him lazily, with half closed eyes, and seeing the question in his face, nodded yes to it. ""How long have you been taking it?"" She beckoned him to the divan beside her, but he moved reluctantly, and chose the chair, embarrassed and ill at ease, like a man controlled by something beyond himself. ""It did not begin until years after I was married. Oh, years and years! It was only four years ago. What I went through before — but that is neither here nor there. This began it."" She held out her left arm, which was crooked just above the wrist. ""You see, it never got quite straight again."	"The pain was incessant, almost unbearable at times. The doctors tried everything but nothing seemed to work until they prescribed this."" She gestured towards the vial. ""It helped, initially, more than you can imagine. The relief was immediate and profound. But then, as time passed, I needed more and more to achieve the same effect."" Her voice trailed off, and she looked away, her gaze focusing on some distant point beyond the walls of the room. He watched her, noting the shadow that crossed her face, the way her fingers now clutched at the fabric of the divan, white-knuckled. ""It's a powerful drug,"" he said finally, breaking the silence that had stretched between them. ""Dangerously so."" ""Yes,"" she agreed, her voice barely a whisper. ""But when the choice is between relentless pain and this... What would you choose?"" She turned her eyes back to him, and he saw in them a desperate plea for understanding.  He sighed, feeling the weight of her predicament. ""I don't know,"" he admitted."	1913	1988.9484

All are grey in general colour; the feet in the Tasmanian species being white, in the others brownish, though the hind paws in Gaimard's are white. 67 .fjpyprymnua. Head rat like. Muffle half hairy. Ears rather long. Hind limbs much longer than the fore. Tail, evenly hairy, without trace of crest. In size and habit this Rat kangaroo approaches more nearly than others to the Wallabies, but is allied to the other Rat Kangaroos by the three long strong claws of the fore limb. It llufouu Rat kangaroo. lies curled up in its nest during the day, and in the dusk hops around its grazing ground. The head and body are about twenty one inches long, and the tail fifteen inches.	The coloration of the fur tends to be a soft, uniform grey, blending subtly into lighter shades around the belly and inner limbs, providing a natural camouflage in the leafy underbrush and forest floors where it dwells. Its diet primarily consists of grasses, leaves, and occasionally roots and tubers, which it forages with its keen sense of smell. Socially, the Ilufouu Rat kangaroo is generally solitary, coming together with others only during the breeding season which occurs once a year. Mating rituals involve a series of intricate hops and chases, after which the female will gestate for a month before giving birth to one or two young. These offspring are remarkably precocious, developing quickly and becoming independent at a young age. They spend their initial weeks in a well-hidden nest, crafted from twigs and leaves, where the mother visits only to nurse. As they mature, their powerful hind legs develop the strength for which Rat kangaroos are known, enabling them to make bounding leaps when threatened by predators or to cover ground quickly while foraging. Predators of	1909	2005.247
"You will, in fact, be standing in that peculiar oblique beam of light, yourself illuminated to the general eye as the very object of chase and doomed quarry of the thing obscure to you."" But to return to the article, or rather to the sentence in paragraph 6 that I have had the temerity to meddle with. It is, after all, the redeeming sentence in a somewhat dull article, for it gives one a peg for thought. "" Love in its highest form must be mutual, "" and also "" Love without response is not love, "" says Mr. Schvan. There speaks the Western and Materialist. Who shall presume to say that he who gives love without return has not touched the highest ? Enthusiasts on their crosses loving those who hate them ; the mother giving always more than she receives ; the martyr at the stake dying for his spiritual ideals?"	These are forms of love that not only transcend the mutual, but elevate the very essence of what it means to love, lifting it beyond the transactional. Mr. Schvan's view, while poignant in a romantic and perhaps societal context, seems to narrowly confine love to a tit-for-tat arrangement, where the scales must always balance to validate the emotion's existence. Yet, the true profundity of love lies in its ability to persist in the absence of reciprocity, to flourish under neglect, and to give without the slightest hope of return. It is in these unrequited, unresponded expressions where love is tested and its purity revealed. The love of the unacknowledged philanthropist, the undeterred innovator facing ridicule but driven by a passion for progress, the silent sacrifices of countless unnamed individuals—all these instances defy the notion that love must be seen, acknowledged, or reciprocated to be real or meaningful. Thus, while mutual affection is indeed beautiful and desirable, to limit the definition of love to this alone would be to overlook some of the most profound	1911	1975.8065
The public were held breathless. What would happen ? Arrivals at Aldershot, however, found the whole arrangements in such a complete muddle that Army  Service Corps men, who ought to have been at Woolwich, were presenting themselves for enrolment at Bordon, and infantry of the line were conducted into the camp of the Dragoons. The Motor Volunteer Corps were at this moment of very great use. The cars were filled with staff officers and other exalted officials, who were settling themselves in various offices, and passing out again to make necessary arrangements for dealing with such a large influx of men. There were activity and excitement everywhere.	Telegrams were being dispatched at a frantic pace, and messengers rushed back and forth with orders and updates. The air was charged with a mixture of confusion and urgency as everyone tried to make sense of the chaos and establish some semblance of order. In the midst of this, the quartermasters were desperately trying to sort out the supplies. Tents, rations, and equipment had been piled haphazardly around the supply depot, and it was a monumental task to distribute these essentials efficiently to the various units scattered throughout the camp. Meanwhile, the medical corps set up temporary stations to attend to the needs of incoming troops, some of whom had traveled long distances and arrived in less than ideal health. Nurses and doctors worked diligently, providing check-ups and treating minor injuries incurred during the rapid mobilization. As night fell, the glow of lanterns and the sound of hammering filled the air as troops and engineers worked together to erect tents and set up camp beds. Despite the initial disarray, a sense of camaraderie and purpose began to emerge among the men. Stories and jokes were	1906	1963.2103
The other end of the spring is fitted with a grip C, which also holds one end of the test piece D. The other end of the test piece is fixed into a long handle E, by means of which it is bent backwards and forwards through the fixed angle shown by the indicator F. The bending effort or moment necessary on the handle to bend the test piece D through the fixed angle is measured by the deflection produced in the spring B; this deflection is recorded by the horizontal motion of the pencil H on the record paper placed on the drum G. 1 Brit. Assoc. Report, 1904. Also Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., 1904, parts 3 and 4, p. 172, and Proc. Inst. Naval Architects, April, 1908 ; or Engineering and.	Shipbuilding, October, 1908. Such a setup allows for precise measurements of the material's resistance to bending and, consequently, its flexibility or rigidity. The method is particularly useful in assessing the mechanical properties of metals, alloys, and other industrial materials, which must often withstand significant mechanical stresses in practical applications. The precise calibration of the spring B is crucial for accurate measurements. The stiffness of the spring determines the sensitivity of the apparatus, and it must be chosen according to the expected range of bending moments. The calibration process involves applying known forces to the spring and measuring its deflection, thus establishing a direct relationship between force applied and resultant displacement. This relationship is then used to interpret the deflection caused by bending the test piece D, converting this displacement into the corresponding bending moment. The handle E, being of considerable length, serves to amplify the bending effort, making it easier to apply significant forces without excessive physical exertion. Furthermore, the system's design ensures repeatability and consistency in measurements. The fixed angle limitation imposed by the indicator F guarantees that each test is conducted under identical conditions	1908	1974.9464
"So she went to uncle Cyrus, unbeknown to me, an' told him weed like a part of what he was goin' to leave me. Weed like it quick, so's I could buy some timber land I wanted.""

163, which gives the whirling speed of the shaft with no end thrust, Art. 164. If < o = o, equation (6) reduces to Euler's limiting value for this shaft considered as a stationary strut. The formula is evidently only a limiting value subject to limitations in actual shafts due to want of straightness, gravitational and other transverse loads, etc. If the sign of P were reversed it is quite evident that the critical or whirling speed will be raised instead of being lowered; in this case o may be found by reversing the sign of P in (6). The effect of eccentric end thrust, or transverse loads, might be taken into account as in Arts. 104 and 105.	Art. 165. The effect of eccentric end thrust can be analyzed by considering the eccentricity as causing a bending moment in the shaft. This moment increases the deflection and thus the curvature of the shaft, which in turn affects the whirling speed. The presence of this additional bending moment means that the shaft will reach its critical speed at a lower rpm, as the natural frequency of the system is effectively reduced. To account for this, the critical speed formula can be modified by introducing a factor that represents the ratio of the eccentric load to the central load.  Art. 166. Transverse loads, such as those caused by the weight of the shaft or attached components, also influence the critical speed. These loads produce additional bending moments and deflections, further complicating the dynamic behavior of the system. In practical applications, it is essential to calculate the deflection curve of the shaft under these combined loads to accurately predict the critical speeds. This can be done using methods such as the finite element method, which allows for a detailed analysis of complex loading and support conditions. Art. 167.	1908	1948.8016
"She has the gift of taste and of all the subtle insight into motives and impulses without which higher gifts may be unavailing. Her attention to detail makes everything that she does very remarkably convincing, and yet in the end it is to be seen clearly that there has been in it no breath of a sufficient life. In Mol nar's The Devil, Satan in the person of Dr. Nicholas, talking to a woman at the ball, remarks that: ""It is very inartistic to get one's characters into a muddle and then kill them off to get out of it. It is dodging the real issue."" Mrs. Ward not only dodges the real issue in this way, but she also fails to bring it forward properly in the body of the book. It is a cardinal sin wherever found, and no amount of care in the delineation of character and of social states can make adequate atonement."	Her style, indeed, is meticulous and often compelling, but it is as if she polishes the brass fittings aboard a ship that is fundamentally off course. The structure of her narratives, while elaborate, frequently lacks the true architectonic unity that would make them resonate with profound truths. Thus, the reader is left admiring the craftsmanship of individual parts without ever feeling the force of an inevitable whole. This failing is particularly evident when one considers her characters, who are often vividly drawn and psychologically nuanced. Yet, for all their individual appeal, they seem to orbit around the central moral or philosophical puzzles of the novels without ever quite engaging with them. This circumspection robs her stories of the dramatic heft they might otherwise possess. In the broader literary landscape, Mrs. Ward's works, therefore, occupy a curious position. They are neither wholly dismissible nor entirely commendable. They shimmer with potential—hints of deeper insights that are never fully explored or realized. It is this persistent promise of depth, so regularly unfulfilled, that both frustrates and fascinates her readership.	1911	1976.2399
The child who reacts with full attention to the impression needs more time, but is always correct. Hence the one is no better than the other, but they are different types. The one is predisposed by nature to be objective and the other subjective, the one gives his attention to the world and the  222   other to his own personality. They will become two different kinds of beings in later life. The reaction time may be measured without such subtle instruments simply with the second hand of a watch, if not one individual but a whole group of children is to be measured. If the task is to compare the reaction time of fifty children of eight years with that of fifty children of twelve or fifteen years, or the reaction time of fifty boys with that of fifty girls, or the reaction time of fifty children who have had manual training with that of those who have had no manual training and so on, we can apply the so-called chain reaction.	In this method, each child in a line is tasked with performing a simple action (such as clapping or touching the shoulder of the next child) upon receiving a specific stimulus (such as a tap from the previous child). The time it takes for the stimulus to travel from the first to the last child in the chain provides a collective measure of the group's reaction time. This method, while less precise than using advanced instruments, can still yield valuable insights into the general trends and differences in reaction speeds among various groups. Moreover, this approach allows for the observation of social dynamics and coordination within groups, adding another layer of understanding to the developmental influences on reaction times. By analyzing the data gathered from these group experiments, researchers can begin to draw conclusions about the effects of age, gender, and educational experiences on the cognitive and perceptual speed of children. Such findings can then inform educational strategies and developmental support tailored to different needs and capacities, ultimately helping each child to maximize their potential.	1909	2006.6056

The news of Cornelius's disappearance had cast a somber shadow over the community, and speculative whispers circulated with the wind. People spoke of the boy in hushed tones, wondering if perhaps some foul play was involved, or if he had simply run away from the pressures of his impending return home. The local newspapers picked up the story, each day adding layers of concern and mystery as they reported on the various leads and dead ends faced by the authorities. Mayor Thorn, feeling the weight of public concern, organized a volunteer search party. They scoured the local areas, diving into dense forests and combing through the bustling city streets, but to no avail. Cornelius seemed to have vanished into thin air. Meanwhile, Consul Archibald, driven by a sense of duty and urgency, reached out to various other cities and towns, extending the search network.

"I regret to say that some of my comrades, prone to 33  drink, primed themselves with spirits obtained from the neighbouring public-houses in York Road and Waterloo Road. Not that drunkenness had been the rule. On the contrary, the extreme tension of those long, hot days had had a sobering effect, and even men used to drink refrained from taking any. Ah ! I have of late seen some splendid examples of self-denial, British patriotism, and fearless valour. Only Englishmen could have conducted themselves as my brave comrades have done. Only Englishmen could have died as they have done. "" Through all yesterday we waited, watching every movement of the enemy in our line of fire."	Our rifles lay ready, the sun glinting off the barrels, a silent testament to the grim readiness of men steeled for conflict. The air was thick with the anticipation of battle, each soldier poised on the knife-edge of action, yet restrained by the discipline that is the hallmark of our forces. As the hours drew on, the tension became almost palpable, the waiting itself a form of warfare, testing the limits of endurance and nerve. The enemy, visible in the distance, moved like specters across the landscape, their intentions obscured by the haze that lay over the land. Then, as twilight began to merge into the dark of night, the order came. It was delivered in a low, urgent tone by our commanding officer, passing down the line like a current, electrifying the weary men into sudden, fierce activity. With a roar that seemed to shake the very earth, we advanced, our battle cry rending the air. The clash when it came was brutal and unrelenting. Men fell on both sides, the ground becoming a tapestry of chaos and valor.	1906	1997.3585

Srtff., Lond., Deo., 1911, p 268. Some Aspects of Railway Station and Goods Yard Illumination.	The importance of adequate lighting in railway stations and goods yards cannot be overstated. These areas, bustling with activity, require precision and safety, which proper illumination can significantly enhance. The introduction of electric lighting has transformed these spaces, making them more efficient and safer for workers and passengers alike. In railway stations, especially, the focus is on creating a welcoming and secure environment. The platforms, ticket halls, waiting areas, and concourses must be well-lit to ensure safety and comfort. This not only aids in the visibility of signage but also enhances the overall passenger experience by reducing the anxiety associated with travel in poorly lit environments. Goods yards require robust lighting solutions to facilitate the safe loading and unloading of goods. The tasks performed here are often hazardous, and poor lighting can increase the risk of accidents. Strategically placed lights can help in identifying obstacles, ensuring that workers can move safely and efficiently around the space. Moreover, the transition from natural to artificial lighting should be seamless to avoid any impact on operational efficiency. With the advent of modern lighting technologies, such as LED, it is possible to achieve high	1912	2003.3649

The tetra and hexahydroxy acids are insoluble in aether, and the former slightly soluble in boiling water (i grm. in 2 litres), the latter comparatively easily soluble in cold water. By boiling out therefore the products which do not dissolve in aether repeatedly with large volumes of water and filtering in a hot funnel a solution is obtained from which sativic acid if i .f^ present will crystallise out as it cools. The large volumes of mother ^ liquor are concentrated down after being neutralised, and when C(; U''' sufficiently concentrated to give a precipitate on acidification made iv acid; the precipitate collected and dried is extracted with aether to ( .	remove any substances that are soluble in this solvent. After the aether extraction, the residue, which primarily consists of the hexahydroxy acids, can be further purified by recrystallization from water. This process involves dissolving the residue in a minimal amount of hot water and allowing the solution to cool slowly. As the solution cools, the hexahydroxy acids will begin to crystallize out of the solution due to their reduced solubility at lower temperatures. The crystals are then collected by filtration, washed with a small amount of cold water to remove any impurities still adhering to them, and then dried under reduced pressure or in a desiccator to ensure the removal of all solvent traces. This method ensures that the hexahydroxy acids are obtained in a relatively pure form, suitable for further analytical or synthetic use. The purity of the final product can be verified by techniques such as melting point determination, infrared spectroscopy, or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, providing confirmation that the desired product has been isolated effectively.	1913	1999.4456

It has been called Emoa spenceri. 255 subgenus Riopa. Two species of large lizards of this subgenus are Australian. /?. albofasciolatum, over a foot long.brown with a brilliant opaline gloss, with more or less distinct yellowish brown crass bands. R. rufescens, 14 inches long, plain brown, or with bauds similar to those of its congener. They are very closely allied, if really distinct, and both hail from the extreme North, and extend over the adjacent islands.	The habitats of these Riopa species are typically tropical, thriving in dense, humid environments where their glossy skin can often be seen shimmering in the dappled sunlight that filters through the canopy. Their diet primarily consists of small insects and other invertebrates, which they hunt with remarkable agility and precision. Observations suggest that they are predominantly terrestrial, though occasionally seen climbing low shrubs and debris. In behavior, both species exhibit a remarkable ability to blend into their surroundings, a trait that provides protection against predators such as birds and larger reptiles. During the breeding season, which coincides with the onset of the wet season, both R. albofasciolatum and R. rufescens become more visible and active. They engage in vivid displays of dominance and courtship, which include changes in color intensity, posturing, and occasional vocalizations. Conservation efforts for these species are minimal at present, largely due to the remote nature of their habitats. However, as human expansion continues into these areas, it will become increasingly important to monitor their populations to ensure that their habitats remain	1909	2007.6625
Climbing up the mountain one day, she finds a prejudice blocking the path, cutting off the view, and absolutely refusing to move. She makes polite request, she argues, she scolds, she implores — all of no avail. So I sat before him helpless, In an eestacy of woe; The mountain mists were rising fast, The sun was sinking slow — When a sudden inspiration came, As sudden winds do blow. I took my hat, I took my stick, My load I settled fair, I approached that awful incubus With an absent minded air — And I walked directly through him, As if he wasn't there. Actually the only reason why these twenty-seven activities do not stand in their proper, subordinate place — are not at once put where they belong — is the inconstant will of alma mater. When, however, I said that the remedy was simple, I did not mean that it could be applied any how, any way. The means deserve careful thought and the exercise of such good sense as colleges may reasonably be supposed to command.	The proper alignment and utilization of these activities necessitate a structured approach, one that harmonizes with the academic mission while allowing for the growth and enrichment that such endeavors undoubtedly provide. It is imperative that we establish clear guidelines and objectives for each activity, ensuring they contribute effectively to the educational experience rather than detract from it. Furthermore, leadership within the institution must take an active role in this process, not merely endorsing but actively participating in the reorganization. This engagement will signal the importance of these activities, fostering a culture where they are both respected and reflective of the institution's values. It requires a delicate balance, a dance of sorts, where each step is meticulously planned yet appears effortless. The aim is not to stifle the vibrancy these activities bring but to channel their energy in ways that enhance the educational journey. This is the challenge that lies before us, one that we must embrace with both creativity and discipline. Only then can we truly integrate these activities into the fabric of our academic community, ensuring they serve not as distractions but as pillars of a holistic educational philosophy.	1911	2006.934
T ~^^ e psychrometer is an instrument made up  Jr LOF a wet and dry bulb thermometer attached to  a board or frame for determining the humidity L of the air. One adapted for this purpose may be  purchased at a reasonable price from instrument dealers or it may be made as follows: For the frame, take a board eighteen inches long, two inches wide and one half inch thick with a hole bored in one end to hang the apparatus up with when not in use. Get two all glass thermometers with cylinder bulbs and the degrees Fahrenheit engraved on the stem. Cover the bulb of one thermometer with a thin piece of cotton cloth, fastening it securely by a thread. When the  f cloth covering is wet with water and exposed to  evaporation in the air it constitutes the wet bulb thermometer; the other thermometer has no covering on its bulb, is not wet at any time and constitutes the dry bulb thermometer. Fi 23 Psc ro The followin S extract from Bulletin No. 23  metre forbore of the Weather Bureau, U. S. Department of telling frosts.	"Agriculture, explains the principle upon which the psychrometer operates: ""The wet bulb thermometer shows a lower temperature than the dry bulb when the air is not saturated with moisture, because the evaporation of water from the wet cloth causes cooling. The difference in temperature between the two thermometers is an indicator of the degree of humidity in the air. The greater the difference, the drier the air; conversely, the smaller the difference, the more humid the air."" To use the psychrometer effectively, it is suggested that the wet bulb be re-wetted periodically to ensure accurate readings, especially in dry or windy conditions where evaporation rates are high. Swing the psychrometer in the air or use a small fan to circulate air around the bulbs to enhance the accuracy of measurements. After a few minutes, read the temperatures on both thermometers. The temperature difference can then be used in conjunction with psychrometric tables or a calculator to determine the relative humidity of the air. This simple yet effective method helps provide valuable weather data that can aid in agricultural planning, particularly in understanding and predicting"	1914	1967.738
Shots suddenly began to fall fast in Bloomsbury, several of them badly damaging the Hotel Russell and the houses near, and it was therefore apparent that one of the batteries which had been firing from near Jack Straw's Castle had been moved across to Parliament Hill, or even to some point south of it, which gave a wider range to the fire. Presently a shell came high through the air and fell full upon the British Museum, striking it nearly in the centre of the front, and in exploding carried away the Grecian ionic ornament, and shattering a number of the fine stone columns of the dark facade. Ere people in the vicinity had realised that the national collection of antiques was within the range of the enemy's destructive projectiles, a second shell crashed into the rear of the building, making a great gap in the walls. Then, as although all the guns of that particular battery had converged in order to destroy our treasure house of art and antiquity, shell after shell crashed into the place in rapid succession.	The air was thick with dust and the sound of crumbling masonry, while the streets quickly filled with the panicked cries of the onlookers fleeing for safety. The once majestic structure, a repository of countless treasures and historical artifacts, was now succumbing to a brutal onslaught. Inside, priceless objects, some of which had survived centuries and even millennia, were now being reduced to rubble. Ancient manuscripts, irreplaceable sculptures, and rare books were engulfed in a cloud of debris and ash. As the bombardment continued, emergency services struggled to reach the site, hampered by the chaos and the continuous shelling. Firefighters, risking their lives amidst the falling shells, attempted to quell the fires that had started in several sections of the museum. The police tried to cordon off the area, pushing back the gathering crowds that were either too stunned to move or desperately searching for missing loved ones. The destruction of the British Museum, a symbol of cultural heritage and historical continuity, was not just a national tragedy but a blow to the global community. Scholars, historians, and art lovers around the	1906	2006.3517
"We are told that the Kamchadales inflict death on themselves with the utmost coolness because they maintain that "" the future life is a continuation of the present, but much better and more perfect, where they expect to have all their desires more completely satisfied than here."" The suicides of old people, again, are in some cases due to the belief that a man enters into the other world in the same condition in which he left this one, and that it consequently is best for him to die before he grows too old and feeble. The notions of savages concerning life after death also influence their moral valuation of suicide. Where men are supposed to require wives not only during their lifetime, but after their death, it may be a praiseworthy thing, or even a duty, for a widow to accompany her husband to the land of souls."	This belief is particularly prevalent among certain tribal communities where the bond of marriage is considered eternal, transcending the mere physical existence on earth. Such practices are rooted deeply in the cultural and spiritual life of the community, reflecting a worldview in which the boundaries between life and death are fluid and permeable. In these societies, the act of a widow voluntarily following her deceased husband into death is often seen as an ultimate act of loyalty and love, preserving the unity of the family beyond the mortal realm. On the other hand, among tribes where individual prowess and achievement are highly valued, the act of suicide can be seen quite differently. Here, it might be considered a noble choice for warriors or leaders who, facing inevitable capture or dishonor, choose death by their own hand over a life of disgrace. This is viewed not merely as an escape from suffering but as a control over one's own destiny, a final assertion of autonomy and honor. These diverse beliefs about suicide among different cultures underline the significant impact that cultural contexts and religious or spiritual beliefs have on the moral interpretations of such acts. They reveal the complexity of	1908	1972.777
America The great Republic, after the exhaustion incident to the Civil War, fell into a morally comatose state, and privilege was quick to seize upon the opportunity to gain practical control of government, to the end that the people might be exploited at will by the privileged few, for their enormous enrichment, at the expense of the industrial millions. Great commercial trusts and monopolies arose. The public utilities or natural monopolies were seized by men who saw in them vast mines of wealth, ever increasing in their out put as population and products increased. To become in fact but not in theory the masters of government, the interests secured control of party machines and came into sympathetic relation with the corrupt political bosses who made politics a trade for personal gain. Thus the Post Office Department became a gold mine for the railways; while the people were denied the benefit of a parcels post, to the enormous enrichment of the express companies. The public carriers reaped a rich harvest through their monopoly privileges in transportation, while the owners of their stocks and bonds were enormously enriched through various means, such as stock watering, bond inflation, reorganisation and gambling in stocks.	The steel industry, too, was dominated by a few powerful figures who managed to consolidate numerous smaller companies into gigantic trusts, controlling not only the production but also the pricing of steel across the nation. This consolidation led to a dramatic increase in profits for those at the top, while the workers saw little improvement in their conditions or compensations.  The oil industry followed a similar path, with one company in particular becoming a behemoth that dictated terms and prices to refiners, retailers, and consumers alike. Its influence extended even to the railroads, which were coerced into giving preferential rates that stifled competition. Amidst these towering monopolies, the agricultural sector suffered as small farmers could not compete with the large agricultural businesses that controlled the prices of both supplies and produce. The plight of the farmers was exacerbated by the railroads, which charged exorbitant rates for the transportation of agricultural goods, yet offered rebates and discounts to the large industrial companies. In response to these growing inequities, voices of dissent began to rise. Reform movements emerged, spearheaded by those who saw the	1911	1981.0464
(c) The Vision of Constantine But the most popular legends of the cross were those that clustered about the vision of Constantine, including the stories of the Invention and the Exaltation, which were always associated with it. The famous story of the appearance of the cross in the heavens is connected with the victory of Constantine over Maxentius on the 28th of October, 312. It was the defeat and death of Maxentius upon this battlefield that made Constantine Emperor of the West. The story of the vision as told by Eusebius, which accord 'Wm. ^almesb. p. 397. M. s. Chron. A. 883. '	"is that while Constantine was marching with his army, he looked up to the sun before midday and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the words, ""In this sign, conquer."" At first, Constantine was unsure of the meaning of the vision, but that night, in a dream, Christ appeared to him and explained that he should use the sign of the cross as a safeguard in all of his battles. Constantine, deeply inspired by the vision and the divine visitation, had a standard made, known as the Labarum, which bore the symbol of the cross. He also ordered his troops to adorn their shields with a Christian symbol. Thus fortified, Constantine led his army to a resounding victory at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, which not only secured his control over the Western Roman Empire but also marked the beginning of increased Christian influence in Roman affairs. This victory and the purported heavenly sign had a profound effect on Constantine. He enacted several policies that favored Christianity, including the cessation of the persecution of Christians and the restoration of confiscated church"	1904	1884.7426
At Umatilla the smallness of the farm unit brings the farms close together and makes it perfectly feasible for each farmer, if he so chooses, to build his home in one of the towns, the sites for which have been reserved by the Service, so that there need be no home isolation whatever. The rapid growth of the little town of Hermiston is an illustration of this fact. Four or five years ago its site was nothing but sagebrush. today it is a thriving community of upwards of a thousand souls, with solid blocks of brick buildings, fine schools and churches, and many comfortable homes. The apples of this region are second to none in the world, being of firm and juicy texture and of finer flavour than those grown nearer the coast and in lower altitudes.	The climate, with its clear, dry air and abundant sunshine, contributes significantly to the superb quality of the fruit. The contrast between the arid lands before irrigation and the lush green orchards and fields after is striking. It is a testament to the transformative power of water and human endeavor. In addition to apples, the region has become known for its cherries, peaches, and a variety of vegetables, all thriving under the same conditions that make the apples flourish. Farmers in Umatilla have embraced the concept of diversification, understanding that varying their crops not only secures a more stable income but also improves the health of the soil. Community life in Hermiston reflects the prosperity brought about by this agricultural boom. The town hosts annual festivals celebrating the harvest, drawing visitors from across the state and even from neighboring states. Local markets feature the freshest produce, and the sense of pride in the community's achievements is palpable.  Education too has seen benefits from the town's growth. New funding has allowed for expansions in school infrastructure, and there are now more opportunities for local children in terms	1911	2001.8132
Nothing but the most moral relation towards women should be possible for men; there should be neither sexuality nor love, for both make woman the means to an end, but only the attempt to understand her. Most men theoretically respect women, but practically they thoroughly despise them; according to my ideas this method should be reversed. It is impossible to think highly of women, but it does not follow that we are to despise them for ever. It is unfortunate that so many great and famous men have had mean views on this point. The views of Schopenhauer and Demosthenes as to the emancipation of women are good instances. So also Goethe's Immer is so das Madchen beschaftigt und reifet im stillen Hauslicher Tugend entgegen, den klugen Mann zu begliicken.	This traditional perspective, which confines women to the role of silent nurturers within the domestic sphere, indeed reflects a profound underestimation of their capabilities and contributions beyond mere household duties. The notion that a woman's highest achievement is to please and 'bless' a man undermines the broader scope of her aspirations and intellect.  However, the modern discourse must evolve beyond these archaic views and recognize the intrinsic worth of women as equal participants in society. Women should be appreciated not merely for their relational roles as daughters, wives, and mothers, but as individuals with their own rights to education, career, and personal development. The true respect for women involves acknowledging and supporting their autonomy, their right to make choices about their own lives, and their ability to contribute meaningfully in all realms of human endeavor. Moreover, the shift from viewing women through the lens of utility to one of equality and partnership in all aspects of life is crucial. It is not enough to passively respect women; active measures must be taken to dismantle the structures that perpetuate gender discrimination and to foster an environment where true gender parity can	1911	1994.6174
It was a swift move. The landing in Kent had been on the 26th of June, 1460, London was occupied exactly a week later, and a first action at Northampton was fought on the 10th of July, a week later again. Warwick and his large force were completely successful. The King was taken and brought back to London by Warwick, the Queen fled to Scotland, the Duke of York returned to London, and at last openly claimed the throne. But the revolution was too violent to be as yet accepted. A compromise was drawn   tv. *rt* f !rr  . — ..: v  I / ^ A V:  I  MI 1>. i \ 1\\  The Lancastrian march and counter march. — - > The Yorkist marches.	Parliament was convened in October, and the matter was set to debate. The Duke of York presented his claim, not merely as a contender supported by arms, but as one who sought legitimacy through legal means. His claim was rooted in his descent from Lionel, Duke of Clarence, who was the second son of Edward III, thus giving the York family a senior claim over the Lancastrians, who descended from the third son, John of Gaunt. The discussions were arduous and fraught with tension. The assembly was deeply divided, with some supporting the Duke's claim, while others remained loyal to King Henry VI, viewing his rule as ordained by divine right and his lineage as sufficiently legitimate. The compromise that emerged was known as the Act of Accord. It stipulated that Henry VI would retain the throne for his lifetime, but upon his death, the crown would pass to the Duke of York and his heirs. This resolution, however, pleased neither party fully. The Lancastrians feared the eventual loss of the crown and the potential retribution that could follow. The Yorkists, on the	1912	1880.656
Beginning with such an ordinary form  168   of attention experiment we pass to more and more complex formulations. If while the child is looking at those colours or those pictures, a noise is made in the room or a sentence spoken, there will be some whose attention is decreased by the disturbance to such a point that almost all of the pictures are lost, and there will be others upon whom the disturbance is without influence. If we show single pictures in various rhythms, we shall find some pupils who can attend only the slow impressions, others who can adjust the attention to a rapid succession. Yes, we shall find for almost everyone a particular rhythm which is best for his adaptation of attention, and the individual differences may be great. In a similar way we might measure the length of the time during which the children can maintain their attention.	We can use various stimuli—visual, auditory, or even tactile—to determine not just the duration but also the intensity and focus of their attention. For instance, we might present a series of mathematical problems or a list of words to memorize, and observe how long the children remain engaged before their attention begins to wane. This could be followed by a period of rest, after which the same or similar tasks are presented again to see how quickly they can refocus their attention. The variability among children in such experiments is often striking. Some may show remarkable endurance, maintaining a high level of attention for extended periods. Others may demonstrate a quick dissipation of focus, but possess the ability to rapidly regain concentration after a distraction. These differences can be indicative of various cognitive styles and capacities that are crucial in educational settings. By understanding these individual patterns of attention, educators can tailor their teaching methods and interventions more effectively. For example, a child who thrives on rapid and varied stimuli might benefit from a dynamic and interactive learning environment, whereas a child who needs slower rhythms may excel in settings where they can engage	1909	1988.7146
"But the reinforcements were not enough. The Germans held fast to Purleigh and to some reserve positions they had established about Mundon. After two or three hours of desperate effort, costing the lives of thousands, our attack was at a standstill. At this critical moment a powerful counter attack was made from Maldon, and, outnumbered and almost surrounded, our gallant warriors had to give ground. But they fell back as doggedly as they had advanced, the , Argylls, Marines, and Grenadiers covering the retreat on Danbury. ""The guns at East Hanningfield and the two kopjes checked the pursuit to a great extent, and the Germans seemed unwilling to go far from their works."	As night fell, a somber stillness settled over the battlefield, broken only by the occasional crack of a sniper’s rifle and the distant rumble of artillery regrouping for another day’s onslaught. The air was thick with the acrid smell of gunpowder and the moans of the wounded, a stark reminder of the day’s brutal contest. The British forces, though battered, were not broken. Under the cover of darkness, field commanders gathered hastily for a council of war. Maps were spread out on makeshift tables, lit by the flickering light of lanterns, as officers plotted their next move. The consensus was clear: they could not afford another frontal assault without risking annihilation. Instead, they would rely on their superior knowledge of the terrain and conduct a series of smaller, more tactical strikes designed to disrupt the German supply lines and isolate Purleigh. Meanwhile, the Germans, confident in their defensive positions, fortified their lines and prepared for the possibility of prolonged engagement. Their engineers worked through the night, strengthening fortifications and laying down barbed wire, while patrols kept a vigilant	1906	1992.2396
"From the date of Vasco da Gama's return from his first voyage to India rumours concerning the gold of Sofala had fascinated the minds of all classes of men in Portugal. These rumours greatly exaggerated the quantity of the precious metal actnially obtainable, and all the difficulties of acquiring it were lost sight of. There was considerable trouble in occupying Sofala, but the island of Mozambique was taken without any opposition on the part of its Mohammedan occupants. The African settlements appear to have never really thrived ; they were based solely upon exploitation ; for a very long time no attempt had been made to colonise any part of Africa south of the Zambesi; commerce and the conversion of the heathen were the sole objects of the Portuguese who visited the country, but the latter never proved successful. There was no surplus population in Portugal with which to found colonies. To procure labourers to till the soil of the southern provinces, slaves were introduced from Africa; they first arrived in 1441, and "" then the doom of the kingdom was sealed."""	The introduction of African slaves not only impacted the demographic and economic landscape of Portugal but also set a precedent for the treatment of these African territories. The primary focus on exploitation and commerce, without significant investment in infrastructure or sustainable development, led to a cycle of dependency and degradation. The settlements, while initially lucrative due to the trade in gold and other commodities, lacked the foundation for long-term prosperity. Portuguese interactions with the local populations were largely governed by mercantile interests, overshadowing any genuine efforts at cultural exchange or integration. The missionary endeavors, nominally aimed at converting the indigenous people, often served as mere justifications for the expansion of territorial control. The lack of a concerted effort to understand or respect the local customs and governance systems further alienated the native populations and hindered any potential for cooperative development. As years passed, the Portuguese stronghold in these regions began to wane. The settlements, plagued by administrative neglect and a lack of coherent policy, struggled to maintain their economic viability. The initial allure of vast riches faded, revealing the stark realities of colonial exploitation without investment. The legacy of	1908	1994.4995
PROF. S. P. THOMPSON, D.Sc., F.R.S.., the President, responding to the toast, said it was one of the great advantages of the Society that it possessed, not only a President who only came to the meetings occasionally, but a Chairman upon whom the responsibilities were largely placed, so that the duties of Presidency sat rather lightly. It was a source of great satisfaction that the Society had made its mark from the beginning. There was a real need for it. Moreover, during the three years of its existence, had there been any conflict between the varied interests represented in the Society ? He thought not. It was a case of the lion and the lamb, or the leopard and the kid, lying down together although he was not sure which was either.	The harmony that prevailed was truly remarkable and spoke volumes about the character and objectives of our members. It is gratifying to note that our discussions have always been conducted with the utmost decorum and mutual respect, which is essential in a society that brings together such diverse fields of expertise. This congenial atmosphere has undoubtedly contributed to the effectiveness of our meetings and the progress we have made in achieving our goals. Furthermore, the contributions of our members, both in terms of intellectual input and practical advice, have been invaluable. The interdisciplinary nature of our Society ensures that we approach problems from multiple angles, enriching our understanding and leading to more comprehensive solutions. This, I believe, is the strength of our organization. As we look to the future, it is imperative that we continue to foster this spirit of cooperation and respect. Let us strive to maintain the high standards we have set and continue to work towards the advancement of knowledge and the betterment of society. I am confident that with the continued dedication and enthusiasm of all our members, the Society will reach even greater heights in the years to come. Thank you.	1912	1966.0867
The matter is not one which should be left to the judgement of a single individual, however eminent in his profession he may be. The effect of illumination on eyesight is a subject which can only be properly investigated by the concerted efforts of lighting engineers as well as physiological experts, and there are certainly few (if any) existing oculists who have made a sufficient study of the matter to give an authoritative ruling, lighting engineers are well aware how greatly the effect of an illuminant on eyesight depends on how it is used, and insufficient stress might easily be laid on this aspect by those unfamiliar with the most recent advances in illuminating engineering. It need hardly be said that considerable weight would be attached to a decision in the case of such an important building as the House of Commons, and the matter is therefore one of some importance to (helighting industry. Consequently we hold that special prudence should be exercised before a definite opinion is issued.	The complexity of the issue at hand requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only those versed in the technical aspects of lighting but also medical professionals who understand the biological impacts of light exposure. It is essential to consider various factors such as the intensity, color temperature, and distribution of light, as well as the duration of exposure that individuals within the building will experience. This holistic approach ensures that all potential consequences, both beneficial and detrimental, are thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, it would be prudent to review case studies or existing research from similar environments where changes in lighting have been implemented. This could provide valuable insights into the practical outcomes of different lighting solutions and help guide the decision-making process. Furthermore, experimental setups could be considered, where temporary lighting adjustments are tested and evaluated for their effects on both visual comfort and health over a certain period. Given the stakes involved in such a decision, particularly in a setting as significant as the House of Commons, it is imperative that any conclusions drawn are based on a comprehensive analysis supported by empirical data. Only through such rigorous assessment can we ensure that the lighting not only meets	1912	2005.1936
"Such things as fogs, false intelligence, and the interruption of telegraphic and telephonic communication were not taken into account, and were pooh poohed if any person, not content with living in a fool's paradise, ventured to draw attention to the possibility of such contingencies. "" So foolhardy had we become in the end, that we were content to see an immense and threatening increase in the German shipbuilding programme without immediately ' going one better The specious plea that our greater rapidity in construction would always enable us to catch up our rivals in the race was received with acclamation, especially as the argument was adorned with gilt lettering in the shape of promised Admiralty economies. "" As might have been foreseen, Germany attacked us at the psychological moment when her rapidly increasing fleet had driven even our laissez fair politicians to lay down new ships with the laudable  idea of keeping our naval preeminence by the rapidity of our construction. Our wide awake enemy, seeing that should these be allowed to attain completion the place he had gained in the race would be lost, allowed them to be half finished and then suddenly attacked us. """	The result was catastrophic. Our docks and shipyards, caught unprepared, were thrown into chaos. The ships that might have tipped the scales in our favor lay vulnerable and incomplete, their potential strength contributing nothing to our immediate defense. The enemy's timing was impeccable, exploiting our complacency and the gaps left by our optimistic projections. The ensuing naval battles were brutal and swift. The German fleet, bolstered by years of accelerated build-up, proved to be formidable. Our forces, though valiant, were outmaneuvered and outgunned, handicapped by the lack of the very ships that were supposed to secure our dominance. The aftermath was a sobering wake-up call. The nation was forced to confront the consequences of its previous inaction and the dangerous allure of false economy. Discussions in Parliament, once dominated by talks of cuts and savings, now turned to urgent deliberations on bolstering our naval capabilities and ensuring such a strategic blunder was never repeated. In the years that followed, the lessons learned from this dire episode reshaped our naval policy. Investment in naval infrastructure was renewed	1906	1958.7703

THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY DECEMBER, 1911 SCIENCE AMONG THE CHINESE BT Dit. C. K. EDMUNDS PRESIDENT OF CANTON CHRISTIAN COLLEGE I.	The Chinese have always held a profound respect for learning, and their contributions to the early history of science are considerable. In ancient times, their astronomers recorded comets, solar eclipses, and other celestial phenomena with remarkable accuracy. Their engineers constructed elaborate canal systems and bridges that have stood the test of time. In the realm of medicine, traditional Chinese practices such as acupuncture and herbal remedies have been used effectively for thousands of years. However, in the more recent centuries, science in China had not kept pace with developments in the West. This was due in part to the country's isolationist policies, which limited the exchange of knowledge, and a Confucian educational system that emphasized classical literature over empirical investigation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as China faced increased pressure from foreign powers, there was a growing recognition of the need to adopt Western science and technology. This led to the establishment of new schools and universities where Western sciences were taught alongside traditional Chinese disciplines. Dr. C.K. Edmunds, at Canton Christian College, is at the forefront of this transformation. He	1911	1940.2489
"It is suggested that it would probably lie worth while to follow the theory more exactly, and so increase the efficiency of the empennage. Multiplying power. — If mid = niu/f/u = (1 + it) k'v0' and if P denote the force normal to the rudder (Pd the moment), then P = W (« + £)= — ~ v.   382 Thus the automatic rudder acts like a simple tail of coefficient The author calls this automatic rudder an ""elastic tail "" (impennagio elastico), and the coefficient ""which expresses its relative advantage over the simple o rudder he calls the "" multiplying power."" It will be seen later that the above principle enables the ""elastic tail"" to be treated in the theoretical discussion as a simple tail of greater area. The function of the "" automatic rudder"" is indeed not to steer the dirigible, but to keep it at a fixed attitude to the wind, that is to say, it acts as an empennage of increased area."	"This increased area provides a greater stabilizing force, which is crucial for maintaining the dirigible's course and stability in variable wind conditions. The ""multiplying power"" thus refers to the enhancement in the stabilizing effect offered by the elastic tail compared to a standard rudder of the same size. The concept revolves around the elasticity of the material used in the construction of the rudder, which allows it to flex in response to aerodynamic forces, effectively altering its shape and surface area in response to changes in wind speed and direction.  By adapting dynamically, the elastic tail offers a more responsive and robust control mechanism. This adaptability is critical in maintaining the dirigible’s orientation and ensuring it does not deviate from its intended path, particularly in turbulent atmospheric conditions. The theoretical models suggest that by optimizing the elasticity and the surface area of the empennage, one can significantly enhance the dirigible's aerodynamic efficiency and control. Continuing research into the materials and structural dynamics of such elastic tails could lead to developments that would allow for even greater control over large airships, potentially revolutionizing their use"	1912	2004.9335
Warden J. C. Sanders, of the State Penitentiary at Fort Madison, Iowa, said that out of the 455 inmates, very few had had the advantage of a good home Although woman is specialised for this important business of home work upon the outcome of which depends first the vital, then the mental, moral and social, welfare of mankind, she receives in but few cases any preparation for her important task. She takes the methods of housework which are traditional in her environment and makes use of them according to her individual training and aptitude. The exceptional woman may use all the data of the scientists in the administration of her home.	Yet, by and large, the average woman is left to rely upon inherited customs and the wisdom handed down through generations, which, while rich in experience, may not always align with the most efficient or healthful practices. The lack of formal education in domestic management leaves many women unprepared for the complexities of home economics, which goes far beyond mere cooking and cleaning. It encompasses budgeting, nutrition, child development, and health care—areas where informed decisions can have profound impacts on the well-being of a family. Moreover, the societal expectation that women instinctively know how to manage a household simply because of their gender does a disservice to both women and the families they support. This assumption fails to recognize the skill and knowledge required to manage a home effectively, and the benefits that could accrue from a more systematic approach to domestic education. As such, there is a growing advocacy for educational programs that aim to equip women with the necessary skills and knowledge to manage their homes more effectively. These programs seek to modernize the traditional practices with scientifically backed methods, promoting a more rational and efficient approach to household	1911	2005.7704

"The snow cap had recently decreased rapidly, being now near its minimum and irregular in shape, for in the southern hemisphere it was now late in June. Pointing to the planet, I remarked, "" There is our destination ! We see it now as the poet pictured it for us, and the words of Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes ""5  are very appropriate to the present circumstances : ' The snow that glittered on the disc of Mars Has melted, and the planet's fiery orb Rolls in the crimson summer of its year !'"" On the 18th of September we passed between the earth and Mars, nearly in a line with the sun. On that date Mars was in perigee, or at its nearest point to the earth during the present year."	As we drew closer, the details of the Martian surface became increasingly distinct, revealing the intricate network of what seemed to be canals, and the vast ochre deserts that stretched between darker areas, speculated by some to be vegetation. The polar ice caps, diminished though they were, gleamed brightly against the ruddy landscape, a stark reminder of the planet's dynamic climate systems. Our excitement was palpable, each of us aboard the vessel aware of the historic nature of our mission. We were to be among the first humans to attempt a landing on the surface of Mars, a daunting and exhilarating prospect. The preparations for our descent were meticulous, with every system and backup checked and rechecked. As Mars grew larger in our viewports, the reality of our endeavor sunk in. We were not just explorers; we were pioneers on the cusp of a new frontier in human history. The challenges ahead were formidable, but the potential for discovery was beyond anything we had previously dared to dream. The words of Dr. Holmes echoed in my mind, a poetic testament to the fiery red world	1911	2004.9707
And this fact will always be apparent when a teacher seeks to place the supreme emphasis on things spiritual. But though publishers were confident that the book could never pay for publication, and the critics scoffed at it, the author never for a moment doubted but what it would ultimately prove a success, because she believed most profoundly that it contained a message of health and life, in accordance with the divine laws of the universe. That her faith was not without foundation is seen in the fact that no other serious work during the past century, devoted to the elucidation of religious concepts, has met with such phenomenal sales. Though in 1875 there were few persons who even cared to try to read it, in 1891 sixty-two thousand copies of this work, that has always sold at from three to five dollars a volume, had been called for; and by 1905 between three hundred and fifty and four hundred thousand copies had been sold.	The growth in the demand for this book, despite its initial reception, underscores a profound shift in societal attitudes towards spirituality and the deeper questions of life. It is an illustration of how the public’s thirst for understanding and meaningful guidance often catches up with visionary works that were initially ahead of their time. This remarkable turnaround also speaks volumes about the changing dynamics of the publishing industry, which often underestimates the potential of works that challenge prevailing norms or that delve into deeper, more contemplative aspects of human experience. Moreover, the success of this book underscores the power of steadfast belief and the importance of perseverance. The author's unwavering conviction in the value of her work, despite the skepticism of critics and publishers, serves as a compelling testament to the impact that one determined individual can have. Her belief that the truths she presented were both needed and inevitable in the broader dialogue of human progress turned out to be prescient. This case also highlights the evolving nature of readership and market dynamics in the literary world. What was once considered niche or esoteric has often, over time, moved into the mainstream as	1911	2006.4824
The trucker and his wife had several highly irritating experiences with him, as on the occasion when, having been set to plough a patch in the garden, he went on ploughing because nobody told him to stop and he had forgotten orders given him the day before, until he had turned under all the sod of the O'Donovans' only meadow. Finally, applying their Celtic wits to the problem, they took advantage of the capacity of their new servant for fluent reading and writing. They gave  506 him a standing order to carry about with him a pad of paper and a pencil, to set down in black and white every instruction given him, and to consult it at every step. He obeyed this command with a smiling, absent docility, giving, as always at this period of his life, the strange impression of one wrought upon by sweet and secret thoughts.	This method proved quite effective. Each morning, Mr. O'Donovan would list the tasks for the day, carefully instructing him to check each one off as completed. This not only curbed his tendency to wander off in thought but also instilled a sense of accomplishment as he visibly marked his progress. Mrs. O'Donovan found it particularly useful as well, assigning him tasks such as fetching water or tending to the chickens, which he now performed with commendable punctuality. Yet, despite these improvements in his work habits, there remained about him an air of detachment, as if his mind constantly dwelt elsewhere, in some distant or imagined place. Occasionally, he would pause in his labors, a distant look stealing over his face as though he listened to some gentle, inaudible call. These moments, fleeting yet profound, left an indelible mark on the O'Donovans, stirring a mixture of curiosity and mild concern. Even the neighbors began to notice the change, commenting on how the once hapless helper was now so diligently attentive to his duties,	1913	1949.3445
But the action which we willed as such corresponded to our deepest demand ; it must be fulfilled, if we are not to lose our own value. 'Now we saw that our deepest, fundamental action is the will to find self asserting experiences — that is, truth and beauty and morality and so on. Wherever the striving for such absolute values comes in conflict with our individual chance desires for pleasure, we lose our own true value — that is, we do not really remain loyal to our own will — if we yield to the individual desire instead of seeking the absolute value. Ethics teaches us what we ought to do. Now, we ought to do that which makes ourselves valuable, and we ought not to do that which makes  62   THE humai IDEALS  ourselves worthless.	This is the essence of moral action, to act in accordance with what we perceive as the highest and most essential demands of our nature. When we act in ways that align with these demands, we affirm our worth and dignity; when we betray these demands, we diminish ourselves. It is not merely a matter of following rules laid out by society or tradition, although these can guide us. Rather, it is about a deeper alignment with the values that define our very being. Our moral choices, therefore, are expressions of our deepest selves. They reflect our understanding of what it means to live a life that is truly human, a life that aspires towards truth, beauty, and goodness. This pursuit is not simply for the sake of personal satisfaction or happiness, but because it is through these pursuits that we fulfill our potential as human beings. We become contributors to a larger moral order, which transcends our individual lives. Thus, ethics is not a constraint on our freedom, but a means of realizing our true freedom. It is through ethical living that we achieve liberation from mere caprice and transient desires,	1909	1964.5367
On this account he will from the start be ineffective in dealing with the child. If we want to inspire the child, and if we want to preach to him, we may ignore the bodily side,  no   but then the purposive view alone is in order. If we wish to have causal influence on his mind, our work must be a failure if we deal only with the mental half of the psychophysical action. On the other hand, the teacher who ignores the endless complexity of the mental states and thinks of them only in those clumsy forms of popular psychology must also be doomed to failure. The more complex the teacher conceives the mental state to be, the more he will be able to control it. The subtlest influences may count, the faintest fringes of experience may be important.	Thus, the teacher must strive to understand not only the overt behaviors and expressed needs of the child but also the underlying currents of thought, the unspoken anxieties, and the quiet aspirations that animate the young mind. This requires a delicate balance of empathy and analytical skill, a deep listening that goes beyond words to grasp the nuances of the child's inner world. Furthermore, the effective teacher will recognize that each child's mental landscape is a unique blend of cognitive, emotional, and social elements. By appreciating this complexity, the educator can tailor approaches that resonate on multiple levels, engaging the child not just intellectually, but emotionally and socially as well. This holistic engagement is crucial for fostering not only academic success but also for developing the child's self-awareness and emotional resilience. In practice, this might mean incorporating activities that not only stimulate intellectual curiosity but also promote emotional expression and social interaction. It might involve using stories or projects that allow children to explore their feelings and ideas while also learning to cooperate and communicate with others. Through such multi-faceted approaches, the teacher helps to cultivate a classroom environment where	1909	2007.4164
"Precipitation fog like advection fog drifts with the wind, which may have considerable velocity over the area in which the fog develops. CHANGE AND CLEARING OF WARM FRONT FOG. — Thin and thick spots in the fog drift with the wind and will appear in rapid succession when carried by a brisk wind over fixed locations such as an airport. If ""breaks"" in the fog are large, a half hour or even an hour is often required for a single break to drift over a dock or airport. A drifting break must not be confused with clearing of the fog; a break is only an open area in a large patch of fog, whereas clearing occurs at the fog's edge. A break in a fog area can be utilised for limited operations of aircraft, and of seacraft when visibility is required, but interrupted and unhindered operation can take place only after the fog has cleared."	The process of fog clearing, especially with warm front fog, typically begins as the warm front itself moves further and advances, bringing with it a rise in temperature and often an increase in wind speed. These changes contribute to the evaporation or lifting of the fog. Additionally, as the front passes, the air becomes drier, which also helps dissipate the fog. The entire process can be gradual and may vary significantly in time depending on the specific atmospheric conditions present. Meteorologists often monitor the movement of warm fronts and the associated changes in temperature, humidity, and wind patterns to provide accurate forecasts and updates on fog conditions. For pilots and mariners, understanding these patterns and the nature of fog associated with warm fronts is crucial for planning and conducting safe operations. In aviation, for instance, airports may adjust the scheduling of flights based on the expected timing of fog clearing. Similarly, harbors might regulate the movement of ships to coincide with clearer conditions. The ability to predict and respond to changes in fog conditions can significantly impact the safety and efficiency of transportation and other operations in affected areas.	1913	2001.5203

We find his widow applying to the Military Committee for a pension (Messidor, An ii — 1793), which was refnsea her. There was, of course, no real relationship between him and the author of Le Miicmtkrope. The letters quoted above are in the Forster Collection."	Despite these familial and financial struggles, the legacy of Moliere's service and personal life continued to evoke a certain romanticism in the narratives of those who knew of him or studied his history. His military career, though not as illustrious as his supposed literary fame, was marked by a steadfast dedication that mirrored the perseverance seen in his personal endeavors. The refusal of his widow's pension request highlights the often harsh realities faced by the families of servicemen during that period, yet it also underscores the resilience and dignity with which they carried their burdens. The details of Moliere's life, as gathered from the letters and other documents, paint a picture of a man deeply committed to his duties, both military and familial. This commitment extended beyond his lifetime, influencing the lives of his descendants and leaving a subtle mark on the historical records of his time. While his connection to the famed playwright remains a point of confusion or mistaken identity, the true story of his life continues to resonate as a tale of honor, duty, and the enduring human spirit.	1912	1995.9797
"""That the artist was a useful and interesting creature, they were free to admit. But who, "" they demanded, ""that knew the species intimately, could honestly say that he was a well balanced or a reasonable one?"" ""As a general thing, "" they continued, warming up to the subject, ""he lives in an abnormal world of impulse and sensation, and is always thinking and talking about his aesthetic emotions. These purely sensuous re actions to aesthetic impressions or stimuli unquestionably have their importance and value, but as every psychologist knows, they need constantly to be guided, interpreted and restrained by the critical intelligence."	"The artist, however, tends to disregard this balance, often sacrificing rational judgment for the sake of what he considers to be artistic integrity or inspiration. This leads to a life that is rich in passion and creativity, but often poor in order and practicality. His existence is a vivid tapestry of experiences, each thread pulsing with color and emotion, yet the overall pattern can sometimes seem chaotic or undisciplined to those who value structure and predictability."" ""Moreover,"" they added, ""the artist's intense focus on personal expression and individual perception can sometimes isolate him from the common experiences and emotions of others. While this can lead to unique and powerful works of art, it can also create a barrier between the artist and his audience, making his creations less accessible or relatable to the general public."" ""In essence,"" they concluded, ""while the artist's contributions to culture are invaluable, it cannot be denied that his approach to life and work is fundamentally different from that of more conventional professions. It is this very difference, this refusal to conform to ordinary standards and expectations, that both defines his role"	1911	1999.6575
An aqueduct has always seemed to me, though it would be hard to say why, a most romantic thing. The idea of carrying running water across a bridge in this way — water which it is so hard to think of as imprisoned or controlled, and which, too, however shallow, one always associates with mysterious depth The Aqueduct at Little Falls — the idea of thus carrying it across a valley high up in the air, so that one may look underneath it, underneath the bed in which it runs, and think of the fish and the water weeds and the water bugs all being carried across with it, too — this, I confess, has always seemed to me very marvellous.	It is as if nature herself has been harnessed and set to a task so grand and enduring, it transcends the mere utility of its function. To think of the generations of men who planned and toiled, the architects who dreamt it and the laborers who laid each stone, brings a sense of continuity with the past that is both humbling and exhilarating. The aqueduct stands not just as a triumph of engineering, but as a monument to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of progress. Moreover, the aqueduct, by its very structure, bridges more than just physical gaps; it connects communities, facilitates commerce, and enriches lives. It is a lifeline, carrying not just water, but life itself, from one place to another, nurturing towns and cities and allowing them to flourish. The sight of water calmly traversing this colossal structure, defying gravity and landscape, is a poetic reminder of the power of human will and the wonders it can achieve.	1913	1959.5139
If it be possible to conceive that in these two atoll producing ponds there has been, during the course of years, a gradual diminution in size followed by a rather rapid increase in diameter and depth, I believe the formation of the atolls would become a phenomenon readily comprehensible. . . . Concomitantly with the diminution in size, doubtless extending over a term of years, vegetation of the shoreward area would have established itself in characteristic zones. The littoral flora and the submerged plants just outside the shores would have formed a loose turf lining the edges of the pond. This turf would have gradually become more solid as it extended landward and would therefore at a little distance from the water 's edge have become modified in character, giving a foothold for plants of larger growth. . .	As these larger plants took root and flourished, they would contribute further to the consolidation of the shoreline, trapping sediments and organic material with their complex root systems. Over time, the accumulation of these materials would raise the height of the shoreline, creating a more defined boundary between land and water. Simultaneously, the action of the waves and the natural movements of the water would erode the softer, inner parts of the shoreline, gradually increasing the pond’s depth and diameter. This erosion and deposition process would have been supplemented by the growth of coral polyps in the warmer, shallower waters. These corals, building upon each other and the sediment, would form a sturdy, living barrier around the pond, further protecting the inner shoreline from wave action while allowing for the accumulation of sand, broken shells, and other debris. Over centuries, this continual growth and accumulation would result in the formation of a coral atoll—a ring-shaped coral reef encircling a central lagoon. Thus, the interplay of vegetation stabilization, sediment deposition, coral growth, and water dynamics would be key factors driving	1911	1990.3854
In the presence of these aids to the misunderstanding of India the sociological student must admit himself baffled. Nowhere does he find an application to the actual conditions of village, town, or revenue district, of those methods of investigation long since adopted by the social surveyor in the West. The Indian city is an unknown unit; the village appears only as a field of conflict for rival theories concerning the ancient rural community; and so rare are attempts to summarise the facts of a specified area that one is apt to give an extravagant welcome to so modest an essay in descriptive economics as Mr. Theodore Morison's inquiry into the industrial organisation of the United Provinces. The foregoing statement of the difficulty is, I feel sure, in no way exaggerated.	Indeed, the complexity of India's social fabric, with its myriad castes, languages, and religious practices, further muddles any straightforward sociological analysis. The traditional tools and methodologies that serve Western researchers well often falter in the dense weave of Indian society. This is not to say that the task is impossible, but it demands a unique approach, one that is as flexible and diverse as the subcontinent itself. One must consider, for instance, the roles of local customs and informal institutions which play a pivotal role in the daily economic and social interactions but are often overlooked or misunderstood by external observers. Furthermore, the vast disparities in economic conditions between urban and rural areas, or between different states, challenge any uniform approach. Each locality presents its own set of variables and influences that must be understood on their own terms. Therefore, a more granular, localized study becomes essential. This would involve not only quantitative data collection but also a qualitative understanding gained through immersion and direct interaction with the communities. The work of scholars like Mr. Morison is vital as it opens a window into the microcosms	1908	2006.7068
Yet even this lamp really presents little difference  390 in design or efficiency from those in use even down to the fifth century A.D.. But if these early lamps show little sign of inventive ability as compared with modern illuminants, they are interesting for their {aesthetic design and decoration. In many cases these early lamps have been very carefully shaped, both with a view to utility and appearance. For example, the form is such as to give maximum stability, and when no handle is provided, ingenious slots and excrescences are made on the surface so as to give a good grip. In addition to this, both the Egyptian and the later Etruscan clay lamps are often exceedingly well proportioned, and much thought has evidently been given to their embellishment.	The decorations themselves often carry symbolic meanings or reflect the cultural and religious beliefs of the time. For instance, many of the Greek lamps feature depictions of their gods and goddesses, scenes from mythology, or symbols such as the owl of Athena, signifying wisdom. Similarly, Roman lamps might display images of the imperial eagle or scenes of gladiatorial combat, both reflecting the power and the public spectacles of the Empire.  The crafting techniques also varied widely, with some cultures excelling in the fine detailing of bronze lamps, while others specialized in the intricate painted designs on ceramic or terracotta surfaces. The Etruscans, known for their artistry, produced lamps with finely sculpted figures which stood out from the more commonly found simple bowl-shaped designs.  Moreover, the introduction of different types of fuels over the centuries, from animal fats to olive oil, influenced the design of the lamps. The need for a cleaner burn led to innovations in wick technology and the ventilation systems within the lamps themselves.  Thus, while the basic function and mechanism of these ancient lamps remained largely unchanged	1912	1991.3718
"He read the name of the record now with a comforting pride, ""Marching Song of the Surrey Buffs"" — ""Imploring, Father, strength in service, "" and fitted the disc into its place in the machine, which he had wound up with vim, studying the directions carefully lest he break the contrivance before a single vibration had stirred the virgin aether of the wilderness. Slipping off the brake, he started the disc with a furtive forefinger. The sound - shadow of a trumpet assailed him, and then Adele enfolded his senses in her strong, bright voice. He shuddered at the magic which could bring her singing to him in the stagnant African silence, registering upon his eager ear the vast progress she had made. It was evident that she had arrived; the lift and swell of her lovely notes proclaimed it; it was a new and glorious height of song from which her Christmas greeting floated down to him."	"The melody wove through the dense air, each note clear and poignant, a stark contrast to the cacophony of the jungle sounds that usually filled his days and nights. The music, a thread of civilization, seemed almost surreal here, amid the untamed wilds of Africa. He closed his eyes, allowing the strains of the ""Marching Song of the Surrey Buffs"" to transport him back to England, to the bustling streets, the smoke-filled air of the cities, the lush, green countryside, and the faces of those he had left behind. As the last notes of the song faded, he felt a pang of homesickness, a yearning for the familiar which was both painful and sweet. The record continued to spin silently as he sat there, lost in his thoughts, the echo of Adele's voice lingering like a ghost. It was a moment of poignant isolation, a sharp reminder of the vast distances—both physical and emotional—that separated him from his past life. With a deep breath, he opened his eyes and lifted the needle from the disc. The jungle slowly se"	1913	1995.0414
"If the electorate exercise ultimate power of legislation, it is safe to predict that laws will not be susceptible of ""judicial interpretation"" and that judges will not attempt to make the laws for a people competent to enact and enforce their own laws. The popular demand for recall of judges — so far as there is any popular demand — grows out of the fact that the ""dignified, learned, conscientious and high-minded"" Supreme Court of the United States has covertly usurped legislative powers — acting, not as a coordinate body within the limit of its constitutional functions, but as an irresponsible framer of laws. Really, governmental functions are merely dual — the enactment and enforcement of laws essential to the public welfare. The judiciary fulfils its function  660 when it co operates with the executive in deciding guilt or innocence, under the law of the land."	The legislative function, however, should be clearly separated and should rest solely in the hands of those directly chosen by the people to carry out their collective will. When judges begin to interpret laws in ways that seem to extend beyond mere interpretation into the realm of law-making, they encroach upon the legislative prerogative. This blurring of boundaries not only undermines the democratic process but also diminishes the accountability of the judiciary. The principle of judicial review, while necessary for maintaining the constitutionality of laws, must be exercised with restraint. The judiciary should serve as a check on the powers of the executive and the legislature but not as a substitute for them. If the judiciary oversteps its bounds, it risks becoming a de facto legislative body without any direct democratic legitimacy. This situation calls for a careful reevaluation of the role of the judiciary in a democratic society. Measures such as the recall of judges or even term limits could be considered to ensure that the judiciary remains responsive to the will of the people and does not drift into activism that distorts its fundamental purpose. The ultimate goal should be to maintain a balance	1911	1937.8636
"A series of scattered black dots now came out on the open ground to the south of the church. The trees of Eastland Wood soon hid them from my sight, but others followed, mingled with little moving black blocks, which I took to be formed bodies of troops. After them came four or five guns, driven at breakneck pace towards the road that passes between Eastland and Captain's Woods, then more black dots, also in a desperate hurry. Several of these last tumbled, and lay still here and there all over the slope. "" Other dots followed at their heels. They were not quite so distinct. I looked harder. Hurrah ! They were men in khaki. We were hustling these Germans at last."	The whole scene was a chaotic rush of movement, as the men in khaki surged forward, gaining ground rapidly. The air was filled with the sounds of shouts, the clatter of equipment, and the distant rumble of artillery. The advancing troops moved with a relentless energy, their figures blending into the landscape, yet stark against the green and brown backdrop. As the line of khaki-clad soldiers pushed forward, the black dots that were the enemy began to scatter more widely, their organized formations breaking under the pressure. The guns that had been hastily moved into position now boomed loudly, sending echoes rolling through the woodlands and across the fields. From my vantage point, I could see the tide of battle shifting visibly. The Germans, caught off-guard by the ferocity and speed of the assault, were retreating in disarray. The men in khaki pressed on, their momentum unbroken, driving the enemy before them. It was a thrilling sight, one that filled me with a mix of awe and terror, witnessing the raw power of human conflict unfold before my eyes.	1906	1979.353
CXXVII AUGUST, 1913 No. DCCLIX Carlsbad the Cosmopolitan BY HARRISON RHODES UPON closer examination Carlsbad will prove less like Pittsburg than it may seem upon arrival. The broad, dingy valley of the Eger, which contains some grimy, straggling suburbs, some factories belching smoke, and the two railway stations, is really only an evidence of the wise segregation of the town's baser activities. In the narrower valley of the Tepl which opens opposite, the real Carlsbad, the world's most famous health resort, lies, trim and clean, neatly packed between green, wooded hills.	Here, the atmosphere shifts dramatically; the air is clearer, filled with the mild scent of pine and the subdued murmur of the Tepl River. The streets are lined with elegant hotels and ornate spas, their facades a testament to the town's long history as a retreat for the affluent and the ailing. The architecture is a harmonious blend of neoclassical and art nouveau styles, with intricate frescoes and stately columns that speak of a bygone era of grandeur. The promenade along the river is a favorite among visitors and locals alike. It is here that the famed Carlsbad mineral springs are found, each marked by a pavilion or colonnade of distinctive design. People from all corners of the globe can be seen sipping the healing waters from traditional spa cups, strolling leisurely, or resting on ornate benches under the shade of mature trees. The therapeutic properties of the waters, renowned for their ability to aid digestive ailments, draw scores of health seekers yearly, making Carlsbad a melting pot of cultures and languages.

[I858]. ‘ Chamberlain 1; . Kansas City (Mo. ), 28 * Baa Sec. 39.	As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the bustling town of Kansas City, Chamberlain found himself pondering the implications of recent developments in the region. The air was filled with the promise of progress, the railways expanding, cattle trades booming, and the whispers of prosperity that echoed through the streets and saloons. Yet, beneath the surface of economic growth, there was an undercurrent of tension, a lingering unease that the rapid changes were not beneficial to all. Chamberlain, a keen observer of both human nature and the shifting tides of commerce, noted the disparities with a critical eye. The city, vibrant and alive, was a melting pot of opportunity, yet it was also a place where the less fortunate were often overshadowed by the towering ambitions of the wealthy. The clash between the old ways of the frontier and the new order brought by industrialization was palpable, creating a tapestry of conflict and cooperation that fascinated and troubled him in equal measure. As he walked through the streets, his thoughts wandered to the legal and societal implications of such growth. Section	1913	1996.0581
"The hotels, the Lamb, the Red Lion, and other places, did a roaring trade, and altogether the town was more or less demoralised. But all this exultation was fated to be but short-lived, even though the Mayor appeared on the balcony of the townhall and addressed the crowd, while the latest news was posted outside the offices of the Essex Telegraph, opposite the postoffice. The wind was in the north, and about 5.45 in the afternoon the sound of a heavy explosion was heard from the direction of Manningtree. I was in the Cups Hotel at the time arranging for an early dinner, and ran out into the street. As I emerged from the archway of the hotel I distinctly heard a second detonation from the same direction. A sudden silence, ominous and unnatural, seemed to fall on the yelping jingoes in the street, in the midst of which the rumble of yet another explosion rolled down on the wind, this time from a more westerly direction. Men asked their neighbours breathlessly as to what all this portended. I myself knew no more than the most ignorant of the crowd, till in an officer who rushed hastily by me in Head Street, on his way into the hotel, I recognised my friend Captain Burton, of the Artillery. """	"Burton, what in heaven's name is happening?"" I called out as he neared. He paused briefly, his face a mask of urgency and concern. ""It's the munitions depot,"" he said, his voice tense. ""There's been a series of accidents—or attacks—we're not yet sure which. I must gather some men and head there immediately."" The gravity of his words struck a chill through me. The munitions depot at Manningtree was well-known, a critical point for local military logistics. An accident there, or worse, an attack, could have severe repercussions not only for the town but for regional security. ""Can I be of any assistance?"" I asked, though feeling somewhat useless in the face of such a crisis. ""No, stay safe and keep clear of the area,"" he advised sternly, then turned and disappeared into the hotel, presumably to coordinate the response. The street, once buzzing with the day's earlier excitement, now thrummed with a nervous tension. Whispers and speculations circulated with the gusts of the north wind, each person trying"	1906	1994.9098
It is idle to allege that the probability of old age penury is, or can become, a real factor in the determination of wages for agricultural labour and for unskilled or casual town labour, or that the conditions of the labour market in normal times could enable them to give efficiency to such a motive, even if they entertained it. To other critics who insist that provision for old age could be made by all or nearly all wage earners if they would spend less on drink or on other useless or injurious objects, there are two replies; first, that, if such improvements in expenditure were made, other elements in a progressive standard of comfort have a prior claim which would easily absorb the savings; secondly, that the State in its policy is bound to consider not some theoretically wise economy of resources but such economy as is actual or probable.	It is evident that the general conditions of life, the average earnings, and the usual habits of expenditure among the lower-paid workers do not furnish a surplus sufficient for such provision. The necessity for some form of state intervention or assistance thus becomes apparent, not as a matter of charity, but as an essential component of social justice and economic stability. Moreover, the argument that individual thrift could offset the need for state-supported pensions ignores the broader social and economic factors that contribute to old age poverty. Factors such as wage stagnation, inflation, job insecurity, and the rising cost of living disproportionately affect the lower income brackets, making it nearly impossible for substantial personal savings. The role of the state, therefore, should be to mitigate these systemic issues rather than to place the burden of responsibility solely on individuals, especially those least equipped to bear it. Thus, the establishment of state pensions or similar social security measures is not only a reflection of societal compassion but also a pragmatic approach to maintaining the economic vitality and social health of the nation. By ensuring a basic standard of living for the elderly, the state helps to prevent the	1908	1969.7205
Such a government would have arisen, though slowly, if foreign interference had been absent. By the English invasions every possible nucleus of such unity was destroyed. But the civilisation of Ireland was so persistent, so homogeneous, was the product of such an unbroken evolution, that it could neither be supplanted or assimilated by the civilisation of England, more advanced, but drawn from varied sources, and with its varied strands still imperfectly harmonised.	Thus, the native culture, with its deep-rooted traditions and social structures, continued to resist and survive beneath the surface of imposed governance. The Irish clans, bound by ties of kinship and common cultural heritage, maintained their distinct identity, and their leaders, often seen as symbols of national integrity, were upheld with reverence and loyalty. This enduring cultural resilience manifested itself in various forms, from the preservation of Gaelic language and literature to the perpetuation of customary laws and practices, all of which stood in stark contrast to the Anglo-Norman legal and social systems. In the arts, this persistence was visible in the continued production of intricate Celtic crafts, music, and poetry, which not only celebrated the past but also subtly defied the cultural domination of the English. Meanwhile, the monastic schools, though disrupted, found ways to continue their scholarly traditions, ensuring the transmission of knowledge and the Gaelic intellectual heritage to succeeding generations. The result was a cultural dualism that characterized Ireland for centuries, a land where two distinctly different civilizations coexisted, often contentiously. The English influence was undeniable,	1908	1988.2878
Electricity is a possibility, but in all cases of electrical tissues so far studied, considerable masses of muscular tissue have been found as the site of the electrogenic phenomena, again a matter out of the question for a simple organism. With light the problem is different: All that is necessary is the elaboration by the cell through its vital processes of a substance which, when in contact with the oxygen dissolved in the seawater, will produce light. Since certain bacteria can produce such a material from a compound as comparatively simple as asparagin (amino succinamidic acid, CONH2 chnh2ch2 c02h), this is a matter of comparative ease and requiring nothing more than the metabolic processes which might be ordinarily expected. After synthesis, the substance when brought into contact with the seawater would be oxidised with the evolution of light.	This bioluminescent mechanism is not only fascinating but also serves various biological functions such as attracting mates, deterring predators, and aiding in hunting or foraging activities. The biochemical pathways involved in the production of light by these organisms are complex yet highly efficient, showcasing the remarkable adaptability and innovation of natural systems. The substance responsible for bioluminescence, often referred to as luciferin, reacts with an enzyme named luciferase in the presence of oxygen. This reaction results in the emission of light, a process known as chemiluminescence, which is essentially the conversion of chemical energy into light energy without generating significant amounts of heat. Moreover, the phenomenon of bioluminescence is not limited to a single group or type of organism but is found across a wide array of marine life, including fish, jellyfish, and squids, as well as in some terrestrial invertebrates and microorganisms. This widespread occurrence suggests a strong evolutionary advantage associated with the ability to produce light. In the deep ocean, where sunlight cannot penetrate, bioluminescence plays a critical role in	1911	2005.9374
In old days the ceremony used to be performed in a temple. Among the Hindus we meet with the practice of self immolation  of widows — until recently very prevalent in many parts of India — and various forms of self destruction for religious purposes. Suicide has always been considered by the Hindus to be one of the most acceptable rites that can be offered to their deities.	The act of Sati, where a widow would throw herself onto the funeral pyre of her deceased husband, was seen not just as a sacrifice but also as a final act of devotion and loyalty, freeing her soul and that of her husband. This act was believed to ensure a better rebirth or even liberation (moksha) from the cycle of life and death. Such practices were embedded deeply in the cultural and religious fabric of the society, reflecting the profound impact of religious beliefs on personal actions. However, over time, with changing societal norms and increasing influence of both reformist movements within India and external pressures during the colonial period, these practices began to be questioned. The British administration, influenced by Indian social reformers such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy, eventually outlawed Sati with the Sati Regulation Act in 1829. This was a significant turning point that marked the beginning of the end for such extreme religious practices involving self-harm or self-sacrifice. Despite the prohibition, the vestiges of such practices lingered in more remote areas for some time, reflecting the	1908	2003.6421
Better than either automatic or arbitrary disfranchisement is the cultivation of political responsibility which will impel every elector at every election to meet every issue which confronts him. This principle should apply to all representatives of the people. The five commissioners elected by the voters of Trenton, New Jersey, to administer government in that city, assumed control August 22nd. Mr. F. W. Donnelly, a retired merchant, is president of the commission, and will supervise the department of public affairs. E. W. Lee is head of the department of revenue and finance; J. R. Fell of the department of streets and public improvements; G. B.	M. Smith is in charge of the department of public safety, and H. T. Blackburn heads the department of parks and public property. Each commissioner, aside from their specific departmental duties, is responsible for contributing to the overall governance and policy-making necessary to address the city’s needs effectively.  This system, which reflects a growing trend in municipal management, emphasizes accountability and specialized attention to critical areas of urban administration. By having commissioners focus on distinct aspects of city management, Trenton aims to foster a more efficient and responsive government. These commissioners are tasked with not only maintaining but also improving their respective sectors, ensuring that the city’s infrastructure, financial health, safety measures, and recreational facilities meet the evolving demands of its residents. This structure is designed to streamline decision-making processes and enhance the quality of service delivery, demonstrating a proactive approach to civic management that could potentially serve as a model for other cities facing similar administrative challenges. By delegating authority and fostering expertise within specific domains, Trenton’s commission-based government represents a significant step towards more dynamic and effective urban governance.	1911	1991.3594
Another device is to streak the sides of the lamps with lacquer of various colours. The beads then appear to  BEAD ILLUMINATED SIGNS. 509 be tinted in various colours, and the hues shift according to the direction from which the sign is viewed. At close quarters (as in Figs. 1 and 2) the separate beads can be seen. At a distance, however, the luminous dots run into one another, and the design appears continuous. The remaining illustrations show several typical installations of these signs. Pig. 3 is a night view of the well known sign at the Coliseum. It is interesting because of its size, and because arc lamps are used to illuminate its interior.	Fig. 4 depicts a street corner in London where a beaded sign stretches across the roadway, advertising a popular play at the nearby theatre. This sign employs incandescent bulbs behind the beads, creating a vibrant, eye-catching display that shifts in hue as pedestrians and vehicles move past. The effect is particularly mesmerizing during the evening hours, drawing attention from passersby. Fig. 5 shows a unique application of beaded signs in a subway station. Here, the beads are implemented in a more functional manner, displaying directions and important notices. The use of different colored lacquers helps to differentiate various types of information, aiding commuters in navigating the bustling environment efficiently. Lastly, Fig. 6 presents an innovative use of beaded signs at a festive fairground, where they are used to outline shapes and characters of a merry-go-round. The dynamic play of light and color adds a whimsical element to the fair, enhancing the overall atmosphere and drawing crowds towards the attraction. These examples highlight the versatility and visual appeal of beaded illuminated signs, demonstrating their effectiveness in both commercial advertising and	1912	2006.9442
"When she finally walked into the sitting room Robert nearly fell ofFhis chair, for it was the first time he had evening dress. Not that the very simple gown, a little low in the neck, could properly come under that heading, but it was pink and it was fluffy, and somehow it didn't look like anything his aunts ever wore. He fully expected to hear the visitor scolded for keeping them waiting, but evidently that young lady was used to having people wait for her, because she only gave a most perfunctory apology and, And then She stefi eu into the Doorway ever seen any one in unconscious of Miss Bella's frown, said cheerfully: ""Hello, Bobbie, do you sit up for dinner?"" ""My name is Robert, "" he answered, primly. ""We do not care f o r nicknames, though I have suffered all my life from one, "" his aunt explained. ""Oh, but Robert and I can never get on unless we have a nickname."	"It's a sort of bond, you see,"" the young lady continued, with a playful twinkle in her eye. ""Besides, 'Bobbie' is so much friendlier, don't you think?"" She turned to him with a charming smile, clearly intending to win him over. Robert, though taken aback by her forwardness, couldn't help but feel a slight warming in his chest. His aunt, however, was not so easily charmed. ""We uphold certain standards in this household,"" Miss Bella said stiffly, her voice tinged with disapproval. ""It is a matter of respect."" Undeterred, the visitor floated further into the room, her gown rustling softly with each step. ""Well, I must say, your standards do make for a beautiful home,"" she remarked, looking around appreciatively. ""Everything is so elegant. It’s quite the setting for a dinner party, isn’t it?"" She paused by a small table, admiring a vase of fresh flowers. ""And these are simply lovely. You must have a wonderful gardener"	1913	1945.3287
"Ventral surface light greenish grey. Throat spotted or flecked with dull green. (Typical Victorian specimen. — Lucas.) Mr. Fletcher's specimens from the Riverina were "" above pale olive with darker spots and patches, tolerably uniform but lighter on the flanks and limbs, and with a wash of bright yellow about the thighs and upper arms, a faint vertebral line."" Professor Spencer remarks on the dull yellow colour of the frog in the drought times of the Centre, and the marvellous change to green when the animals are breeding in the pools, a green as bright as that of the Nardoo leaves. Length from snout to vent 40 mm. This burrowing frog is not uncommon in the neighbourhood of Melbourne, and is usually met with hiding under stones or logs. It spread north through Bendigo into the Riverina and thence into the Central interior where, owing to its burrowing skill, it has maintained a position in the Lower Steppes. Like  Chiroleptes platycephalus it takes up an internal supply of water and assumes a globular shape."	During the dry season, this remarkable adaptation allows it to survive in arid conditions where other amphibians might perish. The frog is capable of burrowing up to several feet underground to reach moister soil layers, which helps it avoid the scorching heat and retain its crucial moisture reserves. When rains finally arrive, the frog emerges from its subterranean refuge to partake in the frenzied breeding activities that typically follow these wet periods. The breeding calls of the frog are distinct and can be heard during the night, especially after a heavy rain. The male calls are a series of short, sharp notes that rise in volume as the night progresses. The breeding sites are usually temporary pools formed by the rains, where the female lays her eggs in shallow water. The tadpoles that hatch are quick to develop, often reaching metamorphosis before the pools dry up. In terms of diet, this frog is not particularly fussy. It feeds on a variety of insects and other small invertebrates which it finds in the soil or on the surface during its active periods. This diet is supplemented	1909	2005.8494
SEA BREEZE VELOCITY. — Sea breeze velocities range from a few miles per hour to as much as 40 or 50 miles per hour, depending entirely on STRONG OFFSHORE WIND Figure 115. Strong offshore wind obliterates the sea breeze; strong on shore wind masks it. the amount of differential heating present in each locality. Usual temperate zone summertime sea breeze velocities range up to 20 or 25 miles per hour. Highest velocities occur near the heat equator, where the land surface is sand and the water is cool. West coasts of all continents are more likely to present ideal conditions for a strong sea breeze than east coasts, because west coast ocean waters are colder than east coast. Nearly every square mile of sea and land is under the influence of a  pressure field at all times.	The differential heating between the land and the sea creates a pressure gradient that drives the sea breeze. As the land heats up during the day, the air above it becomes less dense and rises, creating a low-pressure area. Conversely, the cooler sea maintains a higher pressure due to the denser, cooler air. This pressure difference causes the cooler sea air to move inland, displacing the warmer air upwards. This cycle enhances local circulation patterns and can significantly affect local weather conditions. Additionally, the strength and reach of the sea breeze are influenced by the topography of the coastline and the prevailing wind patterns. In areas where the coastline features cliffs or high plateaus, the rising warm air can be channeled upward more quickly, intensifying the sea breeze. Conversely, flat and expansive coastlines may see a gentler and more widespread sea breeze. The interaction between the sea breeze and other meteorological elements can also lead to the development of specific weather phenomena, such as sea breeze thunderstorms. These occur when the cool sea breeze meets the warmer inland air, causing the warm air to rise rapidly and cond	1913	1993.7235
It was even said that Judas committed a greater sin in killing himself than in betraying his master Christ to a certain death. According to the Christian doctrine, as formulated by Thomas Aquinas, suicide is utterly unlawful for three reasons. First, everything naturally loves itself and preserves itself in being; suicide is against a natural inclination and contrary to the charity which a man ought to bear towards himself, and consequently a mortal sin. Secondly, by killing himself a person does an injury to the community of which he is a part.	Thirdly, life is a gift bestowed by God, and man does not possess absolute dominion over it. Thus, to take one's own life is to usurp a right that belongs to God alone, constituting a sin against divine providence. Aquinas further argues that suicide is an act of injustice not only towards oneself and the community but also towards God. As creatures, humans are entrusted with their lives as a stewardship, not as a property that they own outright. The implication of this stewardship is that one must manage one's life according to the will and law of the Creator, not according to personal despair or suffering. This theological perspective was widely accepted in medieval Christendom and had a profound impact on legal and moral attitudes toward suicide. It led to the harsh treatment of those who committed suicide, often denying them a Christian burial and confiscating their property, which added further distress to the bereaved families. This view persisted into modern times, influencing both religious teaching and secular law, with societal stigmas surrounding suicide only beginning to shift significantly in more recent decades as understand	1908	1927.5653
The passengers, then, who sail across Great Salt Lake — for it is virtually that, as the trestle is not discernible unless one leans far out of the window — can revel in the taste and smell of salt air without experiencing the unpleasant sensations of a boat ride. One can never fully know the lake until one has bought a ticket in the isolated  264 little brown station on South Temple Street, and climbed into a width long seat of one of the queer open cars making up the antiquated train that hourly carries the bathers to the resorts. Of the pavilions in the neighbourhood of the lake, Saltair is by far the largest, the most popular, and the most beautiful.	Built on sturdy stilts that stretch far into the saline waters, Saltair rises like a grand mirage from the lake's silvery surface. Its Moorish domes and ornate spires glisten under the Utah sun, creating a spectacle that draws the eye from miles around. Inside, the grand pavilion is a hive of activity with its dance floors, dining halls, and myriad amusements designed to entertain families and groups who flock here during the summer months. The music of orchestras often fills the air, mingling with the laughter of children and the murmur of the crowd. Beyond entertainment, Saltair also offers visitors the chance to bathe in the lake's buoyant waters, which are said to have health-enhancing properties due to their high mineral content. Dressing rooms and bathing facilities line the shore, providing convenience for those eager to experience the unique sensation of effortlessly floating, as if carried by the very air itself.	1913	1994.84
Towns disappear and are built again. Countries are depopulated and filled again. Customs change, laws fall into disuse, but new customs come and new laws are made. It is the same irresistible instinct, the same desire, that creates every new society and will continue to create, to transform and re create without end. When, therefore, we talk of the decay of responsibility, we must speak subject to our knowledge of this invincible process of re growth. The most stable society is a perpetual flux of men and institutions. History is a history of transits.	It is the nature of human societies to evolve, to undergo metamorphosis and to adapt. The decay of one element often signals the germination of another, equally potent in its influence and potential. Just as the seasons cycle through renewal and decline, so too does the social fabric, weaving new threads as old ones fray. Each epoch bears its own character, its values and systems shaped by the cumulative wisdom and follies of those that preceded it. Thus, when we observe a seeming decline in societal values or norms, it is crucial to recognize this not as an irreversible fall, but as part of a larger, dynamic process of societal evolution. What may appear as decay may actually be the shedding of outdated structures, necessary for the emergence of new forms better suited to the changing circumstances and challenges of the time. In this light, responsibility itself is not disappearing but transforming. The ways in which we understand and enact responsibility may change, influenced by technological advancements, cultural shifts, and new philosophical insights. As each generation confronts its unique set of global challenges, the manifestation of responsibility adapts to meet those	1908	1995.9038
I think these were the real reasons why the Bill was rejected. Now, what of the future ? Men like myself never really liked the Conciliation Bill, except as the expression by Parliament of the principle that men and women should have the vote on the same terms. Apart from this, the Bill was a very small one, and it would have affected quite a few women. In speaking at meetings in support of Women's Suffrage, over and over again I have said that there was very little hope of carrying a really big measure for the enfranchisement of women until working class women had been wakened up.	The struggle for suffrage must not be an elitist movement, appealing only to the middle and upper classes, but a broad-based campaign that resonates with the experiences and needs of working women across the nation. It is these women, often overlooked, who stand to gain the most from having a voice in the legislative process that shapes their lives and work conditions. As we look to the future, our strategies must evolve. We need to engage more directly with communities that have been traditionally marginalized in this conversation. We must educate, organize, and mobilize at a grassroots level, ensuring that every woman understands the power and importance of her vote. Furthermore, our advocacy must extend beyond mere voting rights to address the broader issues of gender equality and social justice, which are inextricably linked to the suffrage movement. The rejection of the Conciliation Bill, while disappointing, offers a crucial lesson: the necessity of building a more inclusive and representative movement. This involves forming alliances with labor unions, social reform groups, and other organizations committed to progressive change. Together, we can create a formidable force that cannot	1911	2007.4484
This is probably more than twice as many as could be found in all the other Back Bay churches. Clearly, then, the healing power, great and positive as it is as a factor in interesting and drawing many to Christian Science, is wholly inadequate to explain the growing hold Christian Science is taking upon serious minded truth seek ers of today. Such success as is here apparent can only be accounted for on the hypothesis that this message satisfies the age hunger of a growing multitude who are weary of externalism and the husks of theories, creeds and dogmas that fail to nourish the inner life. It is a message instinct with moral idealism. Its appeal is from the materialism of the age and the fleeting pleasures of the hour, to those spiritual verities that are eternal and which ennoble, glorify and enrich life.	The teachings of Christian Science, emphasizing the omnipotence of God and the spiritual nature of reality, resonate deeply with those seeking a more profound connection to the divine and a deeper understanding of existence. This spiritual approach offers a refuge from the often chaotic and superficial nature of modern life, providing a pathway to peace and understanding that is both timeless and deeply relevant. Moreover, Christian Science promotes a practice of introspection and self-improvement that aligns with the inner transformations many are striving to achieve. Its focus on prayer and meditation as tools for healing not only the body but also the soul speaks to those who are disillusioned with traditional forms of worship that seem disconnected from their personal spiritual experiences. The growth of Christian Science is also indicative of a broader shift towards spirituality that transcends rigid doctrinal boundaries, favoring a more inclusive and personal approach to faith. This is appealing to a diverse audience that includes not only those raised within Christian traditions but also those from other backgrounds or with no religious upbringing, who find in Christian Science a universal message of love, healing, and eternal truth. Thus, the appeal of	1911	2006.7192
The pilot often is on instruments inside the cloud, thereby losing all possibility of locating visually any and all chimneys of rising air. An aircraft may pass through a few thunderstorms and encounter nothing but mild up and down currents; but the next storm may place such a severe vertical current in its path that structural damage will result. It is the uncertainty regarding location of turbulent regions which may tax the strength of the craft that makes instrument flying in the presence of Cumuli dangerous. Outside a cloud, the pilot can locate unsafe regions visually by noting areas of towering cumulus heads. Flight path A a in Figure 60 is a smooth and level one, far above the regions affected by the layer of unstable air. Air movement is horizontal, and no vertical currents disturb the plane.	However, Flight path B b, as depicted, ventures closer to the cumulus clouds, where the air is more turbulent due to the rising and descending air currents associated with these cloud formations. This path exposes the aircraft to potential updrafts and downdrafts, which can vary in intensity, sometimes suddenly and without warning. The pilot navigating this route must be vigilant and ready to respond to these erratic conditions, adjusting altitude and speed as necessary to maintain control and stability of the aircraft. In instances where visibility is compromised and reliance on instruments becomes imperative, the pilot's skill in interpreting the data becomes crucial. Instruments such as the vertical speed indicator, altimeter, and airspeed indicator provide essential information that helps the pilot understand the aircraft's behavior in relation to the atmospheric conditions. Additionally, modern avionics may include weather radar systems that can detect areas of significant weather activity ahead, allowing the pilot to make informed decisions about route adjustments to avoid the most severe conditions. Navigating through or near cumulus clouds, especially those showing signs of significant vertical development, requires an understanding of the dynamics of thunder	1913	1993.0607
"It is the only plan by which real equality between the sexes can be hoped for. It has teen said that ""the greatest effort of civilisation up to date has been attaching man to the family."" Very likely, but he has been attached in a way that is bad for him and bad for the family. A pernicious pride has been developed in him which has led him to deem women and children as possessions, a pride no less false, even when sugar coated with sentimental or chivalrous talk of the ""my wife, my mother, my sister, my children"" variety. Men's families have been for the most part either a source of this bad pride or else a millstone round their necks."	This has not only hindered the progress of women but has also stunted the emotional and moral growth of men. To truly rectify this imbalance, society must reframe its perception of familial roles, recognizing them not as proprietary relationships but as partnerships based on mutual respect and equality. The traditional view of the male as the primary breadwinner and the female as the caretaker confines both to roles that may not align with their individual capabilities or aspirations. By promoting a model of shared responsibilities within the family, where both men and women contribute equally to all aspects of family life—be it earning income, managing the household, or raising children—we pave the way for a more balanced and harmonious society. Furthermore, education plays a crucial role in dismantling these outdated norms. From a young age, children should be taught the values of equality, respect, and cooperation. Schools should encourage boys and girls alike to explore a full range of interests and career paths, challenging the stereotypes that often guide these choices. Only through such comprehensive societal reform can we hope to achieve true equality between the sexes, where relationships are built	1911	2007.1881
"Thrust Tc = ^(6 75)^ + (2-5)2 = 673 tonnes The direction and magnitude of the thrust on all the right hand side of the rib is constant, being in the line B.C..

Normal thrust at B = 673 cos i6-87° = 6^44 tonnes Shearing force at B = 673 sin 16'87° = 1*95 tonnes 140. Arched Rib hinged at the Ends. — A rib hinged at the ends only differs from one having three hinges, in that bending stress may result from expansion or P ^ contraction of the rib if the hinged ends are rigidly fixed in position. The stresses in such a rib are statically indeterminate unless some condition beyond the zero bending moment at the two hinges is assumed."	For a rib hinged at the ends, the bending moment at any point between the hinges is influenced by the horizontal thrust, vertical load, and the positions of the hinges. Let us consider a uniformly distributed load along the length of the rib. The horizontal thrust H can be calculated based on the moment equilibrium about either hinge. The vertical reaction forces at the hinges can be determined by taking moments about one of the hinges and setting the sum of moments to zero. This allows us to solve for the vertical reactions as they must balance the vertical component of the load. The bending moment at any point x along the rib can be expressed as: \[ M(x) = \frac{w \cdot x \cdot (L - x)}{2} - H \cdot y(x) \] where \( w \) is the uniformly distributed load per unit length, \( L \) is the total span of the rib, and \( y(x) \) is the vertical displacement at point \( x \) from the chord joining the two hinges.

Fio. 3,  262 Illumination at the Smoke Abatement Exhibition. THE Smoke Abatement Exhibition, which recently took place at the Agricultural Hall (March 23rd april 4th), was primarily devoted to power, heating and cooking by smokeless means, but also contained some interesting examples of lighting. The Electrical Section, organised by (he Electric Supply Publicity Committee provided what was perhaps the most striking display from this standpoint. The passage leading to the hall was lighted by a series of white Excello arc lamps, and the entrance was indicated by a sign illuminated by mercury vapour lamps. The hall was decorated in hangings of a light tint, and this facilitated the use of indirect and semi indirect methods of lighting on a somewhat unusual plan. As will be seen from Fig.	3, the main exhibition space was dominated by large, ornate chandeliers that hung from the ceiling, each fitted with multiple incandescent bulbs that cast a warm, inviting glow over the exhibits below. These were complemented by strategically placed spotlights that highlighted specific features of the displays, such as the innovative smokeless stoves and heating systems that were a focal point of the exhibition. Additionally, around the perimeter of the hall, smaller, more focused lamps were used to illuminate informational plaques and detailed diagrams that explained the technology behind the exhibits. This not only made it easier for visitors to read and understand the material presented but also created a more intimate atmosphere in these areas, drawing attendees in for a closer look. Furthermore, the use of color in lighting was subtly employed to enhance the visual appeal of the exhibition. Soft blues and greens were used in areas showcasing water heating systems, suggesting coolness and efficiency, while warmer yellow and orange lights were used to enhance the display areas featuring cooking appliances, evoking thoughts of warmth and home. Overall, the lighting at the Smoke Abatement Exhibition not	1912	2007.4546
"The report of the Pittsburg commission disclosed many of the details of the American system of wage slavery that is maintained in the city of steel, smoke and squalor. This i6 what Thomas Edison says: ""Art will be increased and distributed as we emerge more and more from the dog stage. Society will have to stop this whiskey business, which is like throwing sand in the bearings of a steam engine. In two hundred years, by the cheapening of commodities, the ordinary labourer will live as well as the man does now with $200,000 annual income. Automatic machinery and scientific agriculture will bring about this result. You cannot have individual machines and everybody working by himself; not individualism, but social labour will dominate the future. Industry will constantly become more social and interdependent."""	The vision Edison casts is one of profound transformation, echoing the sentiments of an age on the cusp of technological revolutions that promise to reshape not only how work is done, but the very fabric of society itself. The commission’s findings, however, paint a grim picture of the present, where workers are ensnared in a relentless cycle of toil under harsh conditions, with little to show for it but their continued survival. The juxtaposition of this stark reality with Edison's optimistic prognosis serves as a poignant reminder of the chasm between the potential benefits of industrial progress and the current exploitation that often accompanies it. As the report further elaborates, the laborers in Pittsburg are subjected to long hours, dangerous work environments, and wages that barely meet the necessities of life, let alone afford any semblance of comfort or opportunity for advancement. The promise of automation and scientific advancement, as Edison suggests, holds the potential to liberate these workers from the drudgery and peril of their daily labors. However, such a future demands a rethinking of societal values and systems of distribution to ensure	1911	1997.487
WHAT ABOUT GRAFT? By Clinton Rogers Woodruff ARE we living in an age of graft? Is graft the besetting American sin of today? Is graft a national disease? These are questions which editors and publicists and an awakening populace are asking, and with abundant reasons. The papers are full, not of charges — vague and indefinite — but of the news of grand jury inquiries, indictments and convictions. Several years ago the Chicago Tribune published a summary of pending graft investigations in which twenty five states were represented. Another paper at the same time published a map showing in black the states then suffering from the grafters. Only seven of the forty-eight states and territories were white: Maine, Delaware, Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Mississippi and Colorado; and if the map were to be brought right up to date it would have to include even these.	The scope of graft has grown to encompass not only the public sector but also the private. It stretches its tentacles into every conceivable avenue of human enterprise, leaving hardly a stone unturned. Whether it be through kickbacks in public contracts, the manipulation of stock in private corporations, or the exploitation of natural resources, the methods of graft are as varied as they are nefarious. The effects are devastating. Graft undermines trust in governmental institutions, hobbles economic development, and saps the moral fiber of the nation. It breeds cynicism among the populace and fosters an environment where honest effort is seen as the sucker's game. The social fabric, woven from threads of mutual trust and respect, begins to unravel. How, then, is this scourge to be combated? Vigilance is the watchword. The press must continue to shine a light on corruption, wherever it may lurk. Legislators must enact and enforce laws that not only punish the guilty but also remove the opportunities for graft. The judiciary must stand firm, resisting any attempts to sway their decisions by illicit means	1911	1990.8458
Examples of family history are given to show the hereditary character of ability on the one hand, and the forms of degeneracy on the other. But the full understanding and interpretation of such pedigrees require the use of a scientific instrument, hitherto only slightly applied in biological and human science. This method is the metrical, or statistical. It is not only important to know that human beings tend to retain certain characteristics through heredity, it is even more important to know the exact degree of this retention, and correspondingly of variation. Modern statistical methods are able to give the exact quantitative measure of likeness, or unlikeness, as between parents and children and between children of the same family.	This allows for a more precise understanding of hereditary patterns and their impact on individual traits and behaviors. Through statistical analysis, it becomes possible to discern the probability of inheriting specific characteristics and to what extent these characteristics might manifest in subsequent generations. Furthermore, the application of correlation coefficients and other statistical tools enables researchers to evaluate the strength and significance of these hereditary links. The use of statistics in studying heredity also helps in identifying the influence of environmental factors on genetic traits. By examining the variance in traits among individuals who share similar genetic backgrounds but have been exposed to different environments, scientists can begin to separate the effects of nature from nurture. This dual analysis is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of how both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of individuals. Moreover, the statistical approach allows for the study of complex traits that may be influenced by multiple genes interacting with each other and with various environmental conditions. This multifactorial analysis is essential for the fields of medical genetics and behavioral genetics, where such complexities often exist. Through these advanced statistical methodologies, the intricate web of genetic and environmental interplay is	1908	2006.8105
Men stand in social and political, in legal and economic and moral relations, and only he who understands this system of mutual connexions understands the world in which he moves. Here, between the formal and the material aspect of men, we have a relation similar to that in the world of things. There we saw that the physical process can be considered from its material side in descriptive physics and from its formal side in mathematical physics. In like manner, the political, and legal, and economic, and social life which surrounds us can be considered in both ways, either with reference to its content or with reference to its form. In the one case we understand it historically, in the other systematically.	To comprehend fully the intricate dance of society, one must engage both perspectives. Historically, we trace the evolution of institutions, ideas, and interactions, uncovering the roots of current conditions and attitudes. This approach provides a narrative of development, highlighting the causes and effects that have shaped the societal landscape over time. Systematically, on the other hand, we analyze the structures and functions of societal components, seeking to understand the underlying principles that govern their operation. Here, the focus is on the mechanisms of interaction and the patterns of behavior that emerge from the complex interplay of societal elements. Both perspectives are crucial for a rounded understanding. The historical view informs us of how we arrived at our current state, offering insights into the continuity and change of social phenomena. The systematic view, meanwhile, reveals the operational dynamics at play, allowing us to predict future trends and possibly manipulate conditions to achieve desired outcomes. Thus, the study of society demands a dual approach, intertwining the historical and systematic to grasp both the flow of human events and the structures that channel them.	1909	2007.3904
"What are known as the Dengie Flats extend for three miles seaward, all along the coast between the mouths of the two rivers, and broken marshy land extends for three miles more inland. Their big ships would have to lie at least seven or eight miles distant from our headquarters and store dept, which we intend to establish at Southminster, and even if they were so foolish as to waste their ammunition in trying to damage us with their big guns firing at high elevations, they would never succeed in doing us any harm. I  believe that the squadron of older battleships that escorted the 108th to Southend have orders to mine the mouth of the Thames, cover the mine field with their guns as long as they can before being overpowered, and incidentally to try and capture Shoeburyness and destroy or bring off what guns they may find there. But this is not really in our particular section of the operations. "" But to return to my own experiences."	During the early hours of the morning, as the mist was just beginning to lift off the damp marshes, we received word that several small enemy crafts had been spotted making their way towards the coastline. With the big ships stationed so far out, these smaller, more agile vessels were evidently tasked with probing our defenses or attempting a more direct form of sabotage. Quickly, we mobilized our limited resources to form a defensive perimeter around Southminster. Our assets were few, but the men were resolute, understanding the strategic importance of keeping our headquarters intact. We positioned sharpshooters along the embankments and readied the few artillery pieces we had, their barrels pointing ominously towards the grey horizon. As dawn broke fully, revealing a sullen sky, the first of the enemy crafts made its approach, navigating cautiously through the shallow waters. The tension among the men was palpable; each knew that the survival of our operations might well depend on repelling this initial scouting force. The skirmish, when it came, was intense but brief. Our gunners, well-practiced despite their	1906	1972.5448
"Or, inversely, one sterean is equal to 3282'8 "" square degrees."" In a recent article in The Illuminating Engineer from a foreign source it was stated that the solid angle subtended by a certain window at a point on the surface to be illuminated was "" 50 degrees."" On referring to the original German, it appears that what the author wrote was "" 50 Quadrat graden "" — that is, 50 square degrees, equal to about 0-015 sterean. * Vol. ir, Dec., 1911, p. 670."	"This discrepancy highlights the importance of precise translation and terminology in technical writings, especially when dealing with units of measurement that may not have direct equivalents in all languages. The term ""Quadrat graden"" clearly refers to an area measurement in the context of solid angles, whereas ""degrees"" might suggest a linear measurement to the uninitiated. Such misunderstandings can lead to significant errors in interpretation and application of the data being presented. In engineering and scientific communications, especially those that cross language barriers, it is crucial that all terms are clearly defined and standardized to prevent such confusion. This incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for international collaboration in the standardization of technical terms and units. Efforts by international standards organizations play a critical role in this regard, ensuring that technical language remains a precise tool for global cooperation in the scientific community."	1912	2002.9424
It ripens from August 1st to December in the Central states. It is easily propagated by seeds which should be stratified over winter and planted in spring the same as the peach pits. The seedlings do not come true from seed. This is especially so with the selected kinds, which are propagated by budding and grafting when two or three years old at the collar in the spring, as soon as the bark will peel easily. This tree is very difficult to transplant and if its tap root is cut off, it is liable to die. The top should be severely pruned when the tree is transplanted. The persimmon will grow in any good agricultural soil, but thrives best on a good, rich, warm soil.	It is particularly fond of limestone soils, where it often reaches its finest development. The tree requires full sun exposure to produce fruit of the best quality and is moderately drought-resistant once established, though young trees benefit from regular watering during dry spells. In terms of fertilization, a balanced approach is recommended, with applications of a complete fertilizer in the early spring and perhaps a lighter application in the early summer to support fruit development. The persimmon is relatively free from pests and diseases, although it can occasionally suffer from leaf spot and fungal infections, especially in humid climates. Good air circulation around the trees helps to minimize these issues. In terms of fruit production, the persimmon does not begin to bear until it is about 4 to 6 years old, but once productive, it can continue to yield fruit for many years. Pruning is generally minimal, aimed at removing dead or crossing branches and maintaining good structure to support the weight of the fruit. Some gardeners also prune to enhance sunlight penetration and air circulation within the canopy, which can improve fruit quality and reduce disease pressures. Harvesting	1914	2004.0597
In early times, to be sure, the boy who left the primary school was under the strict control of the master in the work  shop or in the business. But the nineteenth century changed those paternalizing conditions and brought complete freedom. The result was a steadily growing insubordination and obstinacy, frivolous breaches of contracts and iinreliability, together with a craving for enjoyment on the moral side, and a lack of careful training on the professional side. The community felt this inability to get hold of the boys who had left school as one of the most serious national dangers. In response to this need the continuation schools were founded which are to develop the youth after the school years in moral, practical and intellectual respects.	These institutions sought to bridge the gap between school life and the responsibilities of adulthood. They offered courses that were both practical and theoretical, designed to instill a sense of duty and discipline that the unbounded freedom of the workforce seemed to have eroded. The curriculum often included advanced mathematics, technical drawing, elements of business management, and even ethics and civic duties. Furthermore, the continuation schools were not merely academic; they provided hands-on training in various trades and crafts, ensuring that students could apply their knowledge directly in the workplace. The impact of these schools was significant. Employers noted an improvement in the quality of work and the attitude of young workers who had attended these schools. The youths themselves felt better prepared to face the complexities of professional life, and the community at large benefited from a more skilled and conscientious workforce. Over time, the model of the continuation school influenced educational systems worldwide, prompting a reevaluation of how societies prepare their youth for the transition into full citizenship and professional life.	1911	2002.6564
From this standpoint we understand better the present day discussion as to the manifoldness of feelings. Some psychologists claim that there is only one pair of feelings, liking and disliking; others that there is also a feeling of tension and relaxation; others that there is still a third pair, excitement and rest. But with exactly the same right we might add any number of feelings, or, better, any number of pairs of feelings, inasmuch as it is characteristic that we cannot think of any feelings otherwise than in a relation of pairs. This relation itself already points to the action character of every feeling. Indeed, an action always demands its opposite. The truth is simply that any mode of action perceived as interpretation of the thing which excites it becomes a feeling for us.	Thus, each feeling, be it of tension or relaxation, of excitement or rest, inherently contains its counterpoint, establishing a dynamic equilibrium that underpins our emotional experiences. This dual nature mirrors the fundamental principles of opposition and balance found throughout nature, from the physical laws of motion to the philosophical concepts of yin and yang. Furthermore, it is the interplay between these paired feelings that enriches our psychological landscape, allowing for a complex spectrum of emotional responses rather than a monochromatic array. Each pair of feelings does not exist in isolation but is interwoven with others, creating a tapestry of emotional experience that is both intricate and nuanced. In practical terms, this understanding helps us appreciate the subtleties in our reactions to the world around us. For instance, the feeling of liking something can be tinged with tension if there is a fear of losing the object of affection, or it can be accompanied by relaxation when one feels secure in possession. Similarly, excitement about a new opportunity may carry undertones of fear or anxiety, illustrating the presence of its opposite, rest. Thus, the	1909	2005.2848
"Then the final result will be that we shall see the Divine Mind to be nothing else than Life, Love and Beauty — Beauty being identical with Wisdom or the perfect adjustment of parts to the whole — and we shall see ourselves to be distributing centres of these primary energies and so in our turn subordinate centres of creative power. And as we advance in this knowledge we shall find that we transcend one law of limitation after another by finding the higher law, of which the lower is but a partial expression, until we shall see clearly before us, as our ultimate goal, nothing less than the Perfect Law of Liberty — not liberty without Law, which is anarchy, but Liberty according to Law. In this way we shall find that the Apostle spoke the literal truth, when he said, that we shall become like Him when we see Him as He is, because the whole process by which our individuality is produced is one of reflection of the image existing in the Divine Mind."" The above quotation will give the reader some idea of the author's style and thought, but to appreciate the work it must be read in its entirety and with the same degree of concentration one would give to a serious consideration of any other great and vitally important subject. The International Council of Women: Report of Transactions of Executive and Council, 1899-1904. In four volumes. Edited by May Wright Sewall. Embracing reports of transactions during the third quinquennial term, terminating with the third quinquennial meeting held in Berlin, June, 1904."	The volumes, comprehensive and meticulously detailed, serve not only as a record of the council's proceedings but also as an illuminating document on the global movement for women's rights at the turn of the century. Each volume is divided into sections that correspond to the various committees and their activities, ranging from education and employment to health and legal rights. The reports encapsulate discussions, resolutions, and the strides made in various countries under the Council's influence. Throughout the volumes, one can trace the burgeoning sense of solidarity among women from diverse cultural and political backgrounds as they share strategies, successes, and challenges. The narratives are enriched with statistical data, personal accounts, and insightful analyses, making it a valuable resource for historians and scholars of women's studies. Moreover, the appendices include lists of members, affiliated organizations, and supporters, providing a snapshot of the network of women who were instrumental in pushing the boundaries of their societal roles. The meticulous documentation and thoughtful presentation underscore the Council's commitment to thoroughness and transparency in its mission to empower women worldwide.

Despite ,ns surroundings, despite the foundry, his soul lad always been bright and clear — the light had always burned. But now he had killed a man. An hour of peace came to him just before dawn. The world appeared to roll away miraculously, and he seemed to see what lay before him very clearly and simply. He, Dave McFane, had committed a great crime, and he was out here, hiding in the woods. What a shameful thing! When the morning sun was high and the country lay green and beautiful around him, he walked into Milltown and gave himself up. But something was wrong; nobody seemed to understand. They laughed at him! The warden of the Milltown gaol slapped him kindly on the back and said he had nothing to fear, and he'd be ""out soon."""	"Dave was bewildered. Had he not confessed? Was not his guilt clear as day? Yet here they were, treating him as if he were a man wrongly accused, a victim of circumstance. He tried to protest, to insist on the weight of his crime, but the more he spoke, the more they seemed to dismiss his words as the ramblings of a confused man. ""They think I'm mad,"" he muttered to himself as he was led to a small, stark room that smelt of old stone and mildew. The room was cold, the iron bedstead unforgiving, the thin mattress barely making a difference. He sat there, his head in his hands, trying to understand what was happening. How could they not see the seriousness of his confession? How could they not see the blood on his hands? As the hours turned into days, Dave was visited by a local doctor, a kind-faced man who spoke gently and carried a small leather bag.

CHAPTER III 40. Work done in Tensile Straining. — During the application of a gradually increasing tensile load to a bar, elongation takes place in the direction of the applied force and work is done. If during an indefinitely small extension 8x inch, the variable sti etching force is sensibly constant and equal to F tonnes, the work done is — F X 8x inch tonnes During a total elongation / the work may be conveniently represented by the summation of all such quantities as F. 8x, ie. by — %(F.8x) or f Y.dx ' 0 Graphical Representation. — In a load extension diagram the ordinates represent force and the abscissae represent the elongation produced, and therefore the area under the curve, viz. — J f • 8* represents the work done in stretching. Thus, in Fig. 45 the shaded area represents the work done.	The curve starts at the origin, representative of zero force and zero elongation, and rises as the force increases and the material begins to stretch. The slope of this curve initially is indicative of the material’s stiffness or Young's modulus, which describes the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation in an object). As the load continues to increase, the material may reach its yield point, where it begins to deform plastically. This is indicated by a flattening of the curve, where significant elongation occurs with little or no increase in load. Beyond this yield point, the material may harden, causing the curve to rise again, albeit at a less steep rate than initially. This part of the curve is often referred to as the strain hardening region. Eventually, if the tensile load is increased sufficiently, the material reaches its ultimate tensile strength, the maximum stress it can withstand. This point is the peak of the curve. Beyond this peak, the material necks and eventually fractures, represented by a rapid drop in force even as elongation continues	1908	1987.3413

It is remarked that it appears probable, from Lafay's experiments on rotating cylinders, that at higher speeds of rotation the action of the air current would be modified. Action of an air current on a rotating sector. — Further experiments were made on a rotating sector having two arms of an angular width of 18°. The air speeds ranged from 6 to 18 ms, and the revolutions from 0 to 2,330 rpm. The ratio FJFi of the force at n revolutions to the force at zero revolutions is plotted against the ratio Vcj V of the circumferential velocity of the sector to the velocity of the current: the points lie on a curve. The force on the fixed sector is approximately proportional to the square of the velocity. 217. Xiepfcre, O. Etude d'uu mouliuet cyliiulrique au ventilalear.	This relationship suggests that as the rotational speed increases, the aerodynamic forces acting on the sector are significantly influenced by the interaction between the rotating surface and the air current. As the circumferential velocity approaches or exceeds the velocity of the air current, complex flow patterns such as boundary layer separation and reattachment, vortex shedding, and possibly turbulent wakes become more pronounced. These phenomena can significantly alter the distribution and magnitude of pressure across the surface of the sector, thereby affecting the overall aerodynamic force experienced by the rotating body. The experiments conducted by Lafay and further explored in these studies illustrate the intricate dynamics involved when air currents interact with rotating structures. Such interactions are critical in the design and operation of various mechanical and aerospace systems, including turbines, fans, and propellers. Understanding these dynamics allows engineers to optimize performance, enhance efficiency, and mitigate potential issues related to vibration and noise. Further investigations could explore the effects of varying the shape and size of the sectors, as well as the impact of different air densities and temperatures, to fully characterize the aerodynamic behaviors under diverse operating conditions. Such comprehensive studies would provide	1912	1993.8079

In conclusion, Mr. Dow thanked those present for their close attention throughout the course, and expressed his indebtedness to the various firms who had contributed to the success of the lectures by lending lantern slides and apparatus. He also alluded to the benefit to be derived from meetings of the Illuminating Engineering Society, which he advised those present to join. Ho hoped that courses of .illuminating engineering would soon become a regular feature, and that in the future he might have an opportunity of dealing with some of these points in greater detail. ELECTKIC LIGHTING, CHEMISTRY OF GAS, SHADES, AND REFLECTORS."	The importance of understanding the chemistry of gas, along with the optimal use of shades and reflectors in electric lighting, cannot be overstated. These elements play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of lighting systems. For instance, by comprehending the chemical properties of gases used in lighting—such as neon, argon, or xenon—one can better predict their behavior and performance in various conditions. This knowledge directly influences the design and functionality of lighting fixtures and systems. Furthermore, the strategic use of shades and reflectors can significantly alter the distribution and intensity of light. Shades serve not only as aesthetic components but also as functional tools to control glare and direct light to desired areas. Reflectors, on the other hand, are essential for maximizing light output by redirecting light that would otherwise be lost. The material, shape, and finish of reflectors are all critical factors that determine their efficiency. Incorporating these technical aspects into the design and implementation of lighting systems leads to more energy-efficient and user-friendly environments. It is hoped that future courses and discussions within the Illuminating Engineering Society will	1912	2006.1652
The psychological influence is bad, especially after the affectional nature has been awakened. It is all very well for the aged ones to talk of weakness in yielding to temptation. Strength comes through experience, and youth is inexperienced.	Thus, it is natural that the young should find themselves more susceptible to the allurements of temptation. They stand where the paths diverge, often without the guiding hand of wisdom to lead them aright. Their hearts, full of the fresh, untempered energies of life, are like soil newly turned—fertile ground for the seeds of both virtue and vice. It is in these formative years that character is built, for better or for worse, through the choices made day by day. The aged, having traversed these paths and learned through trial and error, possess the hindsight that youth lacks. They see the dangers that were once hidden by the mists of their own inexperience. However, the admonitions of the aged, though wise, often lack the empathy necessary to bridge the gap between generations. This disconnect can render their counsel less effective, as it may not resonate with the vibrant, pulsating reality of youthful existence. Therefore, it is crucial for those who guide the young to remember their own early struggles with temptation and to approach the task with patience and understanding. The	1911	1895.3027
The validity of this statement will not be affected, I think, by either the size of the group with which the systematist may deal, or the phase of the subject which specially interests him. It applies just as well to the man who specialises in a single genus as to him who attempts to comprehend a whole order or class. The only difference is that the smaller the group, the more the worker may hope to attain his purpose, at least to some degree. The larger the group the less is it possible for the purpose to be attained. Nor does it matter whether the systematist is especially interested in new species, or in the morphology or life histories of old ones, or in the geographical or geological distribution of animals.	The principles that guide his study remain fundamentally the same. He must rely on careful observation, meticulous classification, and a methodical approach to understanding the relationships and differences among the organisms he studies. The tools and techniques may vary—ranging from genetic analysis to field observation—but the core objective of systematics, to establish order and infer evolutionary relationships, does not waver. This task of organizing biological diversity is daunting, and the more extensive the group under study, the more complex and intertwined these relationships often become. This complexity can make comprehensive understanding elusive, but it also underscores the richness and intricacy of the natural world. Each species, each genus, and each family tells a part of the story of life on Earth, contributing to a larger narrative that spans billions of years. Thus, while the scale of study and the specific interests of the systematist might shape the scope of the inquiry, the underlying challenge remains: to peel back the layers of natural history and reveal the web of life that connects all living things. This endeavor is not just academic; it has profound implications for conservation, medicine,	1911	2006.2816
Let us extend Sir Almroth's terms of peace.	Let us consider them not merely as diplomatic suggestions, but as the foundation stones upon which a lasting and real peace might be built. They must be more than mere armistices, pausing only for breath in the weary struggle of nations; they must be imbued with a spirit of true reconciliation and understanding. Imagine, then, that these terms are not only accepted but expanded upon. Nations could engage in open dialogues, not just about the cessation of hostilities, but about the roots of their conflicts. Shared cultural exchanges, economic partnerships, and collaborative environmental efforts could become the norm rather than the exception. Furthermore, let's propose that these terms include provisions for educational exchanges, where the youth of different nations could learn together about their diverse histories and cultures, building bridges of understanding that can span generations. The establishment of an international peacekeeping body might also be considered, one with the power not just to enforce peace but to mediate and resolve conflicts before they escalate. This body would be genuinely representative, not skewed by the power dynamics of a few nations, but reflective of the global community. In	1911	1964.7292
It is no matter for great surprise, then, to be told that the different portions of the spectrum into which a beam of light is spread out show different degrees of temperature when tested by an apparatus of sufficient delicacy. It appears, in point of fact, that the dark lines in the spectrum are also areas of relative coolness, and that the spectrum may be charted by moving a sufficiently delicate heat measurer along it. The instrument with which this feat of measuring infinitesimal gradations of temperature is accomplished is known as a bolometer, and was invented by the late Professor Langley, of the Smithsonian Institution. The principle on which the bolometer is constructed demonstrates that any change of temperature in a metal changes the capacity of that metal as a conductor of electricity. By using an excessively tenuous, flattened thread of platinum for his conductor, and an exquisitely sensitive galvanometer to register the effects.	Professor Langley was able to detect variations in temperature as minute as one hundred-thousandth of a degree Celsius. The bolometer operates by having the platinum strip form part of an electrical circuit. When radiant energy, such as light from the spectrum, strikes the strip, it heats up slightly, altering its electrical resistance. This change in resistance affects the current flowing through the circuit, and these changes are then measured by the galvanometer connected to it. The bolometer's sensitivity to temperature changes made it an indispensable tool in the study of radiant energy and its distribution across different wavelengths. It allowed scientists to explore not only the visible parts of the spectrum but also the infrared regions, which are rich in thermal radiation but invisible to the naked eye. This exploration led to significant advancements in our understanding of both solar radiation and the properties of light and heat. Langley's invention also paved the way for modern spectroscopy, enabling more precise measurements and deeper insights into the composition of light from various sources, including stars and other celestial bodies. The ability to measure the heat properties of different wavelengths helped confirm theories about	1913	1986.9711

"" I doubt that, John, "" I replied ; "" but probably he is some very important personage. How singular, "" I added, "" that this spot which I selected should be the only one toward which we were able to steer our vessel!"" ""Well, we shall soon know something about that, I expect, "" replied John. "" Heh, mon !

The crowd below was indeed a sight to behold—creatures of various shapes and sizes, garbed in an array of colors so vivid it was nearly blinding. They were gathered around the dais, their faces turned upward in anticipation, their expressions an eclectic mix of curiosity and reverence.  As our ship descended closer to the ground, the details of the scene became clearer. The figure on the dais, presumably their leader, was adorned in robes that shimmered with a metallic sheen, reflecting the light of Mars' two moons. His skin was a deep shade of crimson, and he wore a high, ornate collar that sparkled with what looked like precious stones. M'Allister chuckled softly, breaking my concentration.

The larger the number of unsaturated unions that occur in a fatty acid or its glyceride the more unstable it is, and the more readily it takes up oxygen; the fact that in those tissues of the animal body in which fats are burnt and not merely stored in reserve, the fatty acids found are more unsaturated than those of the glycerides which are found in the adipose tissue, or contained in the food, shows that the former have been got ready for oxidation, while the reserve is kept in the inactive form : the body stores its powder wet for safety, and dries it only when required for use. The chemistry of the acids more unsaturated than the oleic series has as yet been but little developed; the constitution of none of these acids has yet perhaps been finally determined, and some of the most highly unsaturated acids are known only by their halogen derivatives. (a) The Oleic Series, C Tiglic acic?^ C5H8O4 occurs as glyceride in croton oil, and is stereoisomeric with angelic acid, the dibromo derivative of which is converted by sodium amalgam into tiglic acid. By its constitution, as the expanded formula shows, it is an a methyl crotonic acid : — CH, - CH - C - COOL CH It is soluble in water. The calcium salt, unlike that of angelic acid, is more soluble in hot than cold water.	(b) The Linoleic Series, C18H32O2, is found predominantly in many drying oils, such as linseed, poppy seed, and walnut oils, and is characterized by having two double bonds. It is involved in the formation of drying varnishes and paints due to its tendency to polymerize and oxidize upon exposure to air, forming a solid film. Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid, meaning it must be ingested as the human body cannot synthesize it. Its role in the body includes maintaining the integrity of cell membranes and being a precursor to signaling molecules. (c) The Linolenic Series, C18H30O2, with three double bonds, is even more reactive than linoleic acid. It is found in high concentrations in flaxseed, soybean, and hemp oils. Similar to linoleic acid, linolenic acid is an essential fatty acid and plays a critical role in normal cellular function and growth. It is especially crucial for the proper development and functioning of the brain and nervous system. (d) Arach	1913	2007.111
"Mr. Ismay proved himself far braver when he went forward to face obloquy and slander, and still more bitter, the doubts of his own conscience, by which the sensitive must ever be assailed. The souls of men, their actions, and their motives at such crises are far too complex to be measured by the commonplace foot rules in current use ; that is why we would all do well to remember the warning, ""Judge not that ye be not judged."" A WOMAN. [(i) To hold that from a ship which sank with over 1,500 people on board there was no one (save Mr. Ismay) to occupy a seat in the boat to us is as incomprehensible as to say two and two make five. It boggles intelligence, and we cannot argue it; but (2) supposing there was no one to get in the boat because the multitude did not realise the danger, who, save the Captain and Mr. Ismay, was responsible for lack of knowledge. Knowing the extent of the danger, and knowing that the rest were largely ignorant of that extent, for the President of the Line to take the place of safety, to come ashore, and have the effrontery to make the statement that there was no one else to be saved (on that deck !)"	is to strain credulity to its utmost bounds. It is a point that is not merely about personal survival; it is about the ethics of leadership and responsibility. When a man occupies such a position of authority and trust, his actions under duress are expected to reflect the highest standards of moral integrity and sacrifice. It is not enough to claim ignorance or helplessness in such situations, especially when the lives of so many are at stake. Furthermore, the argument that other passengers failed to perceive the gravity of their peril does not absolve a leader of his duty to inform and protect those under his care. It is precisely in moments of direst need that true leadership must come to the fore, demonstrating courage not by seeking personal safety, but by ensuring the safety of the most vulnerable first. In the tragedy of the Titanic, the questions of who knew what and when, who had the power to act differently, and who chose self-preservation over the welfare of others, are questions that probe the very core of human values and ethical conduct. Thus, while Mr. Ismay’s personal bravery in facing	1911	1947.7264
0 need not necessarily be the centre of gravity of the machine, as it is easy to transfer the forces and moments from 0 to , the centre of gravity ; 0 is usually taken to be a point in the model a distance l vertically above the axis VV and in the axis of the sleeve Z. We have already described the method of measuring the moments about axes parallel to Oy and Ox, and distant h below them. These are both measured on the vertical force lever, and are designated as Vp and Vr. To determine the other forces and moments the model is freed by undoing the screw X and removing the mounting from the sleeve Z. The mounting is then fastened on the top of the vertical force rod, described in Report No. 68, pp. 64,65. The total vertical force on the model is determined as described there, and is the force along the axis Oz, designated as Vp.	To measure the lateral forces, the model is again adjusted, ensuring that it is perfectly horizontal to avoid any unnecessary tilting which could affect the readings. The lateral forces are then assessed using the horizontal force lever, which is aligned perpendicular to the vertical force lever. This setup allows for precise measurements of forces acting along the Ox axis, which are crucial for understanding the aerodynamic behavior of the model under test conditions. Once all forces have been measured, the moments created by these forces are calculated. This involves multiplying the force value by its distance from the reference point O, providing a moment about that point. This calculation is crucial as it helps in understanding the torque and rotational effects that the forces exert on the model. To ensure accuracy, these procedures are typically repeated several times under the same conditions to account for any potential anomalies or measurement errors. The average of these readings is then taken to represent the most accurate value of the forces and moments acting on the model. This systematic approach to measuring and calculating forces and moments is essential for validating theoretical models and for making necessary adjustments to the design of the machine.

Lord Acton is evidently thinking of liberty almost entirely under the terms of freedom in moral and religious thought and action. His judgement would have been more complete and adequate had be learned to think of liberty in larger terms, in the terms of the full development of all the capacities and qualities of human nature; but while Lord Acton's phrase is somewhat narrow his meaning is sane and just, for his concern for religious and moral freedom is really a concern for that which seemed to him to be the highest form of self expression.	He saw in the liberty of conscience not merely an abstract right, but a fundamental necessity for the cultivation of personal virtue and societal harmony. His emphasis on moral and religious freedom stems from his deep conviction that without these freedoms, the individual soul suffers and the progress of society is stunted. Indeed, Lord Acton’s advocacy for freedom in these realms was rooted in his broader philosophical belief in the dignity and potential of the human being. He understood that the suppression of these freedoms not only impeded the moral development of individuals but also deprived society of the diverse perspectives necessary for true intellectual and cultural flourishing. Thus, while his focus may appear narrow when compared to modern conceptions of liberty that encompass economic and political dimensions, it is clear that Acton’s concern was ultimately directed towards the comprehensive development of human capacities. His insistence on the importance of moral and religious liberty was, in his view, essential to nurturing the critical thinking and ethical integrity required for responsible citizenship and leadership. In this way, Lord Acton’s conception of liberty, though seemingly specific, touches upon a universal principle: that true freedom supports the	1908	1972.9813
"And yet I suppose such phrases as "" a tree planted by the streams of water, "" ""a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of the house, "" ""the mountains round about Jerusalem, "" can never bring to us the full sense of beauty, [ 66]  the enlargement of heart, that they gave to the ancient Hebrews. But, in spite of this double loss, in the passage from verse to prose and from Hebrew to English, the poetry of the Psalms is so real and vital and imperishable that every reader feels its beauty and power. It retains one valuable element of poetic form. This is that balancing of the parts of a sentence, one against another, to which Bishop Lowth first gave the familiar name of ""parallelism The effect of this simple artifice, learned from Nature herself, is singularly pleasant and powerful. It is the rise and fall of the fountain, the ebb and flow of the tide, the tone and overtone of the chiming bell. The twofold utterance seems to bear the thought onward like the wings of a bird."	Moreover, the rhythm and cadence inherent in such parallel structures lend a musical quality that transcends linguistic boundaries, allowing the essence of the Hebrew poetry to resonate even through the veil of translation. The Psalms, with their rich imagery and profound emotions, manage to convey a universality of human experience—of lamentation, joy, penitence, and awe. Despite the shifts from the poetic to the prosaic and from one language to another, the core of their expressiveness is preserved. This ability to touch the hearts of diverse readers across ages and cultures is perhaps what makes the Psalms a perennial source of inspiration and solace. Their poetic form supports this timeless appeal; the parallelism not only enhances the lyrical quality but also aids in the memorization and recitation of these verses, embedding them deeply in the communal and individual consciousness. Thus, even as some nuances of the original language might be lost, the Psalms continue to live, breathe, and inspire through their enduring poetic structure.	1908	1999.3663
"It's aged him a good deal. He trusted Bets implicitly, as he would himself. And now — in addition — you want him to do something that he feels to be wrong."" ""But, Edward, they are married! Isn'T it a tyranny"" — she brought the word out bravely — ""when it causes so much suffering! — to insist on more than the law does?"" "" For us there is but one law — the law of Christ!"" And then, as a flash of something like anger passed through his face, he added, with an accent of stern conviction, ""For us they are not married — and we should be conniving at an offence and a scandal if we accepted them as married persons. Oh, dear Marcia, why do you make me say these things? I cant discuss them with you!"""	"Marcia's eyes filled with tears; she felt the weight of his convictions pressing heavily upon her own more yielding nature. ""I understand, Edward, I do,"" she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, her hands nervously twisting the fabric of her skirt. ""It's just that I see their pain, their struggle, and it tears at my heart."" Edward's expression softened as he regarded her distress. He took a step closer, his voice gentler. ""I know, my dear, I know it's hard. You see their suffering and you wish to mend it, as is your nature. But we must also consider the greater good, the moral fabric that holds our community together. We must think of the example we set."" Marcia nodded slowly, the conflict evident in her eyes. ""But where do we draw the line, Edward? At what point does our moral stance become... uncharitable? Unkind even?"" Edward sighed deeply, the weight of their responsibilities as community leaders heavy on his shoulders. ""It is never unkind to uphold the truth,"	1913	1933.9586
"Even at seventy-five their editing powers may be flourishing. And this apart, we have not yet heard of old age pensions for editors. As for teachers — well, this is unkind! Teachers in State schools, after paying to the State about £3 a year, we believe, from the age of twenty until they are sixty -- five, get about 16s. lod. per week! This is scarcely the rosy prospect of the state endowed mother! In view of such facts as these, we think Mr. Wells is mistaken when he states ""there will not be a greater rush into motherhood than there exists now."""	Indeed, one might argue that the economic pressures and the modest support provided in other professions could push more individuals towards embracing motherhood as a viable role, particularly if it were to be better supported or more highly valued by society. The comparison drawn by Mr. Wells overlooks the nuanced reasons why individuals make life choices, which are often influenced by a complex interplay of economic, social, and personal factors. Furthermore, the notion that motherhood might not become more popular under different circumstances underestimates the potential impact of societal support and recognition. If motherhood were to be recognized as a vital and respected contribution to society, complete with adequate financial and social support, it is conceivable that more individuals might choose this path. In conclusion, while Mr. Wells may hold his views about the appeal of motherhood, it is essential to consider the broader societal and economic contexts that shape these decisions. Enhanced support and recognition could indeed change the landscape of how motherhood is perceived and embraced.	1911	2002.281

Tail long and prehensile, aiding in balance during gliding. Eyes large, adapted for nocturnal vision. Primarily insectivorous, occasionally supplementing its diet with fruits and nectar. The Lesser Flying Opossum, Petaurus breviceps, is commonly known as the Sugar Glider due to its sweet tooth and gliding capability. Its fur is typically grey with a distinctive black stripe that runs from its nose to the midpoint of its back. The underbelly is a creamy white, providing a stark contrast to its darker dorsal side. Adults can reach a total length of approximately twelve to thirteen inches, with the tail accounting for half of this measurement. This species is widely distributed across eastern and northern Australia, Tasmania, and several surrounding islands. It inhabits a variety of forested environments, from eucalyptus woodlands to rainforests, where it can be found nesting in the hollows of trees. Social creatures, Sugar Gliders often live in groups of up to seven individuals, communicating	1909	2001.8573
Bound up as sex is with the sense which is first to come and last to go — the sense of touch — and integrally bound up with the reproduction of human life, the fact that all feeling should be bound up with sex means that feeling is making its last effort to live ; and should feeling in this respect die out, then the curtain will ring down upon the human drama with no hope of a recall. Consequently, sexual emotion being the commonest emotion, it is in regard to this that women have to find out what a different acceptation of the purport of sensation in this sphere will entail. And here we will endeavour to be precise in our phraseology. And not only is it necessary for us to be precise; it is equally necessary for readers to be precise. A word or phrase is restricted to its own meaning, and cannot bear the added weight of associated meanings.	Thus, when discussing the emotive and biological implications of sexual feeling, it is crucial to delineate between the physiological responses and the psychological experiences that accompany them. Sexual emotion, while fundamentally rooted in biological processes essential for reproduction, also carries profound psychological and social implications which influence human behavior and societal norms. In understanding these complexities, one must consider not only the instinctual and reproductive aspects of sex but also its role in forming emotional bonds, expressing love, and contributing to personal and interpersonal fulfillment. These dimensions of sexual feeling are not merely byproducts but are central to the human experience, shaping how individuals perceive themselves and interact with others. Moreover, the cultural context cannot be ignored, as it significantly shapes how sexual emotions are experienced and expressed. Different societies and cultures impose various meanings and constraints on sexual behavior and its associated emotions, which in turn affect how individuals experience their sexuality. These societal influences can either suppress or enhance the natural expression of sexual feelings, leading to a wide spectrum of emotional health across different populations. Therefore, in discussing sexual emotion, it is imperative to approach it with a nuanced understanding that incorporates	1911	2006.8402
Training, training, and again training — that is the whole secret. Housework must once more be elevated to the dignity of a craft. (b) That proper conditions of labour must be granted to those who elect to follow this new old calling. A living wage, fair hours, and proper opportunities foe recreation must, be secured to domestic workers. Consider for a moment what the effect of establishing a guild of domestic workers on the above lines would be. All the old objections to domestic service as a career for educated women would cease to hold good.	The stigma of servitude would be replaced by the pride of professional skill and association. The guild could set standards for training and performance, much like those in other skilled trades, ensuring that those who enter the profession are adequately prepared and respected for their expertise. Moreover, it would allow for a system of certification and advancement which could include various levels of expertise and specializations, from basic housekeeping to gourmet cooking and expert management of household affairs. With these measures in place, domestic work could attract a broader range of applicants, including those who might not have previously considered it due to social biases or the lack of professional recognition. Furthermore, a guild would provide a supportive community for workers, advocating for their rights and providing a network for sharing best practices and employment opportunities. Moreover, the establishment of fair wages and working conditions would address a significant barrier to entry. No longer would domestic workers have to tolerate exploitation or the whims of individual employers. Instead, they would enjoy the protections and benefits afforded to other professionals, such as clear contracts, grievance procedures, health benefits, and pensions.

We have seen that the atoms which. thus give up their secrets to the photographic plate are billions of times smaller than the smallest particle of matter that is directly visible under the microscope. It would seem, then, as if this recent feat of Sir Joseph Thomson, together with the spectacular demonstrations of Professor Rutherford, must carry us into the realm of the invisible almost to the limits of imaginable minuteness. But, in point of fact, there remains ~: : e other step that the physical investigators of our time have been able to take, which would still further tax credulity were it not certain that the things recorded are the results of definite experimentation and not of mere day dreaming. The final feat of analysis to which I now refer is that which demonstrates that within the smallest atom, there is a something almost two thousand times smaller than the atom itself — a something that is detachable from the atom, and susceptible of being measured as to its mass and tested as to its electric charge with the aid of apparatus actually in use in the laboratory.	This astonishing discovery pertains to the subatomic particle known as the electron, first identified by J.J. Thomson in 1897. These electrons, it appears, whirl about within the atom much like planets orbiting a sun, but at speeds incomprehensibly swift and on scales unimaginably small. The nucleus, around which these electrons orbit, contains protons and neutrons and was later explored in greater depth by Rutherford through his experiments with alpha particles and gold foil, leading to the planetary model of the atom. The implications of these findings are profound, not only reshaping our understanding of the fundamental structures of matter but also opening new avenues in both theoretical and applied physics. From these insights emerged quantum mechanics, a field that deals with the behavior of matter and light on the atomic and subatomic levels, explaining phenomena that classical physics could not. Furthermore, the manipulation of these subatomic particles has led to advancements in technology such as transistors and semiconductors, the building blocks of modern electronics. The exploration of the atom has thus not only expanded our knowledge of the universe but has	1913	1984.3866
At the beginning of the Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering SOCiet^ (p. 169) will be found a brief report of the meeting on March 19th, with a summary of the discussion which took place on the ' Lighting of Printing Works.' This is followed by a list of new members of the Society. The paper by MR. F. W. GOODENOUOH on The Illumination of Printing Works by Gas begins on p. 171. The paper consists mainly of a comprehensive collection of data with regard to the lighting of various departments in several well-known printing works, much of the information being arranged in the form of tables and diagrams.	Mr. Goodenough emphasizes the importance of adequate lighting in these environments, not only for the efficiency and comfort of the workers but also for the quality of the printed materials produced. He discusses the specific requirements for different areas within the printing works, such as the typesetting room, the press room, and the finishing area, each necessitating unique lighting solutions to accommodate the precise tasks performed therein. The paper also explores the comparative advantages of using gas lighting over electric, particularly focusing on the evenness of illumination provided by gas, which can be crucial in color printing where consistency in lighting is paramount. Additionally, Mr. Goodenough addresses the economic aspects, noting that while initial installation costs for gas lighting can be higher, the ongoing operational costs are often lower compared to electric lighting, making it a cost-effective solution in the long run. Several case studies are presented, detailing the implementation of advanced gas lighting systems in major printing establishments and the resulting improvements in workflow and product quality. These examples serve to illustrate the practical benefits and potential challenges of adopting such systems. Towards the conclusion of the paper, Mr.	1912	1991.1586

Flute budding involves placing a bud into a vertical slit made in the bark of the stock, which is usually somewhat larger and can accommodate multiple buds. 37. The main difference between grafting and budding is that grafting involves joining two plant segments to form a new plant, while budding involves inserting a bud from one plant into the stem of another. Grafting typically uses a piece of a stem with several buds, whereas budding typically uses a single bud. 38. When performing budding, it is crucial to ensure that the bud is fresh and undamaged, that the cuts are clean and precise, and that the bud is securely wrapped to prevent drying out and to promote successful union. 39. Grafting wax is used to seal grafts and prevent them from drying out. It helps to ensure that the moisture and organic integrity of the graft junction are maintained, which is essential for the healing and growth processes. 40.

Despite such critical headlines, the efforts of the Free Speech League continued to gather support among numerous intellectuals, civil rights activists, and various organizations who saw the importance of preserving and extending First Amendment rights. The League organized rallies, delivered lectures, and published pamphlets to educate the public on issues of censorship and the necessity of maintaining a free, unfettered press. They argued that without such protections, democracy itself could be imperiled. The League also participated in legal battles, offering support to cases that could set precedents for broader interpretations of free speech. They closely monitored legislative proposals that threatened to encroach on freedom of expression, mobilizing their members to lobby against such measures. Through these activities, the Free Speech League aimed to create a society where the exchange of ideas was not stifled by fear of governmental retribution, but rather encouraged as a means of fostering innovation and societal progress. Their work, though often contested, played a crucial role in shaping the legal landscape around the issues of free expression and censorship"	1911	1993.0555
Nearly south of us Croydon seemed from our altitude to lie almost beneath our vessel. We directed our course towards the southeast, passing over the railway station at Thornton Heath, with Croydon to the right of us, just as the clock of the Croydon Townhall was striking nine. The long lines of lighted streets made a fine panorama, and we could trace the lights of the moving tram cars out to Anerley, South Norwood, Purley, Wallington, and Mitcham. Although we were fully 5000 feet, or nearly a mile, above the earth it was surprising how clearly we could hear the sounds from below — the rumble of the electric tram cars, the clang of their gongs, the toot toot of the motor horns, and, louder still, the whistles of the locomotives on the London and Brighton Railway were born to us with almost startling distinctness through the still night air.	This sensation of hovering over the bustling life below while enveloped in the serene quiet of the upper air was both exhilarating and surreal. The contrast could not have been more stark—the mechanical cacophony ascending from the earthly domain, while above, the sky offered a tranquil, almost sanctified silence, broken only intermittently by the gentle hum of our vessel's engines. As we continued our flight, the lights of the city began to blur into a continuous glow, a testament to the sprawling urban life of Greater London. Directly ahead, the Thames snaked its way through the landscape, a dark ribbon lined with intermittent sparks from the various towns along its banks. We could make out the iconic bends of the river as it approached the heart of London, and farther away, the faint outline of the North Downs added a ghostly horizon under the moonlit sky. Our pilot, keen on showing us the breadth of our journey, pointed slightly eastward where the distant glow hinted at the vastness of the metropolis.

"It is usually reckoned in pounds or tonnes per square inch. The ultimate strength in tension is also called the Tenacity. The greatest calculated stress to which a part of a machine or structure is ever subjected is called the working stress, and the ratio — ultimate strength working stress is called the Factor of Safety. It is, of course, usual to ensure that the working stress shall be below the elastic limit of the material; but this is not sufficient, and designers, when allowing a given working stress, specify or assume, 1 A brief and interesting account of the "" Crystallisation of Iron and Steel "" for engineering students has been written by Dr. J. W. Mellor. (Longmans.) • Phil. Trans. Roy."	Soc., 1903. It is essential that materials used in construction do not merely stay within their elastic limits but also possess a sufficient factor of safety to accommodate unexpected stresses and strains that may occur due to unforeseen circumstances. The factor of safety varies depending on the material, the type of construction, and the expected loads and stresses. For example, in civil engineering structures like bridges and buildings, a higher factor of safety is typically required compared to mechanical applications such as machinery, where the loads may be more predictable and controlled. Factors such as wear, fatigue, and environmental conditions must also be considered when determining the appropriate factor of safety. This ensures longevity and reliability of the structure or machine under all expected conditions of use. In practice, a factor of safety of around 2 to 4 is common for many applications, although critical structures or those exposed to variable loads might require higher factors. Furthermore, the choice of material plays a crucial role in the overall safety and performance of the structure. Advanced materials such as high-strength alloys and composites are increasingly being used to improve the strength-to-weight	1908	1995.9116

When all the external forces are known, the shearing force and bending moment are easily obtained for any section, the former being the algebraic sum of the external transverse forces to either side  of the section, and the latter being the algebraic sum of the moments of the external forces to either side of the section. The question of positive or negative sign of the resulting sums is arbitrary and not very important; but in a diagram it is well to show Fig. 65. — Freely supported beam with uniformly distributed load. opposite forces and moments on opposite sides of the base line. Take the case in Fig. 66 fully as an example. The load is uniformly spread at the rate of w per inch run over a length c of the beam.	The reactions at the supports A and B, which are equidistant from the center of the beam, will each be equal to half the total load. Thus, if the total load is \( w \times c \), where \( w \) is the load per unit length and \( c \) is the length of the beam, then each reaction at the supports will be \( \frac{w \times c}{2} \). To find the bending moment at any section of the beam, say at a distance \( x \) from the left support A, consider the forces acting to the left of the section. The reaction at A provides an upward force, while the weight of the beam segment to the left of the section exerts a downward force. This downward force is equal to \( w \times x \), as it is the weight of the portion of the beam from A to the section under consideration. The bending moment \( M(x) \) at the section can be calculated by taking the moment of these forces about the section. The contribution from the reaction at A is	1908	1935.8564

Reinhardt's approach underscores a shift in theatrical productions from mere recitations or enactments to a complete sensory experience.  The potential of lighting in theater extends far beyond mere illumination. It shapes mood, directs focus, and can even alter perceived dimensions and depths of the stage. By manipulating shadows and highlights, lighting can suggest time of day, weather conditions, or a change in location, all without a single physical alteration to the set itself.  Moreover, with advancements in technology, such as the integration of LED lights and programmable systems, designers can now experiment with a spectrum of colors and intensities, dynamically changing in rhythm with the performance. This capability allows for a more fluid and expressive correlation between the narrative and the visual effects, enhancing the overall dramatic impact. In productions like those directed by Reinhardt, where the visual component is as integral as the script itself, the role of the lighting designer becomes as crucial as that of the director.

Za is the lift; K0, the lateral force ; L0, the rolling moment ; Mo, the pitching moment: and N0, the yawing moment. Only the first two enter into the equations of steady motion in rectilinear flight.	The values of K0 and L0 are critical in maintaining the stability and control of the aircraft during flight. By analyzing the readings R1 and R2, engineers can adjust the design or the control settings to optimize performance. For lateral and rolling moments, additional equations similar to the ones for X0 and M0 may be used. These might involve other moment readings taken at different positions or under varying flight conditions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the aircraft's behavior. The stability of an aircraft in flight is heavily dependent on these moments and forces. A slight miscalculation or oversight in any of these parameters can lead to significant deviations from expected performance, potentially compromising the safety of the flight. Further experimental data and theoretical analysis are often necessary to refine these readings and ensure that the aircraft will perform as expected under all operational conditions. This includes testing various configurations of the aircraft's wings, tail, and control surfaces in different flight regimes.

The plastron consists only of flattened dermal plates, formed in a linear series of pairs, and with a single unpaired plate, the iutergular, which may reach the margin in front or be separated from it by the front pair of plates, the gulars. In some cases other dermal plates, the wings of the plastron, appear on the sides, uniting the carapace to the plastron. As might be anticipated from the display of defensive armour, the animals are remarkable for their leisurely method of progression, especially on land.	Their movements in water are somewhat more agile, but even there, they are by no means swift. Turtles and tortoises, the chief bearers of these protective shells, have adapted to a variety of ecological niches, from arid deserts to the depths of vast oceans. The shell, being a critical evolutionary adaptation, serves not only as a shield against predators but also plays a crucial role in their thermoregulation. The color and pattern of the shell can help in camouflaging the animal in its natural habitat, providing an additional layer of protection. The structure of the carapace and plastron also varies significantly among species, reflecting adaptations to their diverse lifestyles. For instance, aquatic turtles tend to have streamlined, flat carapaces that aid in swimming, while terrestrial tortoises have more dome-shaped shells that provide better defense against terrestrial predators. The flexibility in the shell structure, particularly in the plastron, is evident in species like the soft-shelled turtles, where the bony plates are replaced by a tough, leathery skin that allows for greater	1909	2007.3373
Since the representatives of the American Medical Association's legislative programme have denied this claim, a brief survey of the uninterrupted attempts of the old school state medical societies to obtain restrictive or monopolistic laws, since they realised they could not successfully compete with other schools and systems of cure in a free field, will prove at once illuminating and convincing. More than fifty years ago the political doctors of the various state medical societies, which today are integral parts of the American Medical Association, began their attempts to take from the people by law the right to employ the practitioners of their choice. Later, when the commercial monopolies began to arise, the attempts of these privilege seeking doctors, who so keenly felt the need of legal protection, became increasingly determined and insistent, but the spirit of '76 was still abroad in the land. The people were in the earlier days very jealous of their dearly bought rights to political, religious and medical freedom, and the privilege seeking doctors had to move with great caution.	Nevertheless, they persisted in their efforts, gradually shifting tactics as they encountered resistance. Initially, they sought to discredit alternative medical practices by labeling them as quackery, dangerous, and unscientific. This campaign was aimed at creating a public perception that only traditionally trained physicians could provide safe and effective medical care. As they gained more influence, these groups began to lobby for legislation that would regulate the practice of medicine, ostensibly to protect public health, but with the underlying intent of establishing monopolies over medical practice. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these efforts bore fruit in the form of medical licensing laws that required practitioners to pass examinations and hold degrees from approved medical schools—schools that were predominantly aligned with the allopathic model of medicine. These laws effectively barred many practitioners of homeopathy, naturopathy, and other alternative medical systems from legally practicing unless they conformed to the standards set by the dominant allopathic institutions. The impact of these legislative measures was profound. They not only restricted the practice of alternative medicine but also limited the public's access to a diverse	1911	2004.8202

It is thus seen that while mere expressions of opinion are generally not actionable as fraud, if the opinion is issued by an expert in a manner that implies it is grounded upon facts which are false, or if it is given under circumstances where it is reasonable for the recipient to rely upon it as a statement of fact, then it can be actionable. This distinction is critical in cases involving commercial transactions where the expertise of one party may influence the decisions of another.  In the context of leases and contracts, the courts have also recognized that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. This is particularly relevant when one party to the contract has significantly more power or information than the other. In such cases, the stronger party is often held to a higher standard of conduct. Misrepresentation, even if not rising to the	1913	1908.3248
There is little in the writings of Hippocrates of direct value to us today; yet while crude, imperfect, and visionary, they were of profound importance in the development of medicine. They constitute the first systematic literary presentation of pure medical science and art, aside from sacerdotal systems. They were, for the time, a very creditable beginning toward the development of rational medicine; and had progress in the subsequent ages been as substantial as that in the brief time prior to Hippocrates, the history of internal medicine for the ensuing two thousand years would not have been one of stagnation and inefficiency. Hippocrates showed himself to be a keen observer of clinical phenomena, a master clinician, and the part of his work of permanent value was the accumulation of clinical facts by observation, or the empirical method of developing medical knowledge which time has shown to be the only efficient method. Hippocrates displayed the noblest conception of the medical vocation, and in this, with his method of developing clinical knowledge, he set a standard and example for all time.	"His emphasis on prognosis and diagnosis, as well as his ethical considerations, laid the groundwork for a more humane and methodical approach to treatment. The Hippocratic Oath, though often modified, still serves as a moral guide for modern medical professionals, underscoring his lasting influence on the ethos of medicine. Furthermore, his categorization of diseases and detailed symptom descriptions contributed significantly to the early taxonomy of medical conditions.  While much of the theoretical framework he proposed, such as the humoral theory, has been superseded by more contemporary scientific understandings, the core principles of careful observation and the systematic recording of clinical outcomes remain central to medical practice today. His works, including treatises such as ""On the Sacred Disease"" and ""Aphorisms,"" not only provide a window into ancient medical practices but also reflect a critical, sometimes skeptical, approach to understanding and treating ailments that is quintessentially scientific. Thus, despite the archaic nature of his theories, Hippocrates' pragmatic approach to medicine and his profound respect for the ethical dimensions of the physician's role continue to resonate in modern medical philosophy"	1911	2006.7816

The hoop tension at A and C is found just as in (1) and (2) to be — p X OAT  and at Band D is similarly — p X OB t and, as in (3) and (4), the longitudinal tension is — p X (internal area of pipe) t x (perimeter of pipe) The bending moments reach their extreme values at A, B, C, and D, being alternately of opposite signs at those four points, and passing through zero between two consecutive points. A simple graphical method of finding the bending moment and shearing force and tension at different points in the perimeter of such a pipe or cylinder is given by Mr. A. T. Weston in the Engineer, Sept. 23, 1904. 120. Seams in Thin Shells.	Seams in thin shells are critical areas that require special attention in both design and analysis due to the discontinuities they introduce in the material and geometry of the structure. These discontinuities can significantly affect the stress distribution and overall structural integrity of the shell. The focus is primarily on ensuring that the seams can handle the stresses imposed by internal pressures, external loads, and environmental factors without failure. In designing seams for thin shells, engineers must consider the alignment and spacing of the seams to minimize stress concentrations. Techniques such as staggering the seams or using higher strength materials at the seams can be employed. Additionally, the method of joining at the seams, whether welded, riveted, or bolted, plays a crucial role in the durability and strength of the shell. For welded seams, the quality of the weld, including penetration, weld bead shape, and the absence of defects such as porosity or cracks, is vital. Non-destructive testing methods such as ultrasonic testing, radiographic testing, and magnetic particle inspection are often used to assess the integrity of welds. Riveted and bolted	1908	2005.39

"" L'Etat, c'est nous, "" is beyond the limits of conception. — ED.] 9 » » ""REMEDIES FOR DISEASE."" To the Editor of THE FREEWOMAN. MADAM, — As a woman worker in the City and having had a great deal of experience amongst those who suffer silently in the ranks of the toilers, might I earnestly plead for the discussion of a subject which is, to my mina, too much neglected, viz., the true physical development of the "" Freewoman "" ? We can most of us realise that the better paid wage earning women, such as are to be found in the Civil Service, are not, on the whole, to be so much pitied as their unfortunate sisters who are to be found in their thousands pitted against tremendous odds, with their physical strength for ever in the balance."	It is to these latter, the underpaid and overworked, that I would draw particular attention. Their daily struggle not only demands an almost heroic endurance but also a constitution that can withstand continuous stress without succumbment. Yet, how can we expect such resilience when their very conditions of work and living undermine the health necessary to meet such demands? The issue of physical development is often overshadowed by the immediate economic pressures these women face; however, it is intrinsically linked to their ability to earn a living. Without health, there is no capacity to work, and without work, there is no economic independence. Thus, the cycle of poverty and poor health perpetuates itself, trapping these women in a state of perpetual disadvantage. I propose that we initiate community-based programs focused on nutrition, exercise, and rest—fundamental aspects of physical health that are often neglected in discussions of workers' rights. These programs could be funded and supported by local businesses and government initiatives, aiming to provide accessible and sustainable health resources. Moreover, the education of employers about the importance of reasonable working hours, regular breaks,	1911	1958.2576
"In Blackburn and West Ham the additional cost of the unemployed is put at about 30 percent. In a good many others the work is simply stated to have taken longer or been more expensive. The quality of the work is less criticised than the quantity. A good many committees declare the quality to have been quite up to the standard. The quality of the men may be judged partly from their industrial classification, partly from the remarks upon their work. According to each indication the casual labourer plays a very large part. Over 50 percent. of all applicants are entered under this heading directly, and a very large proportion of the remainder, appearing under the building trade or "" other occupations, "" are no doubt of substantially the same industrial class."	The situation is further complicated by the fact that a considerable number of these men have been out of regular employment for extended periods, which not only affects their ability to perform tasks efficiently but also their morale and motivation. Thus, while the committees may not explicitly fault the quality of the work performed, there is an implicit understanding that the output may not always align with the expectations set for more seasoned or consistently employed workers. Additionally, the reliance on casual labourers, who often possess a broad but shallow skill set, poses challenges for project management. These workers are typically used to short-term engagements and may not have the specialized skills required for more complex aspects of construction or other skilled trades. This can lead to delays and increased costs as tasks may need to be redone or additional supervision is required to guide less experienced workers. Furthermore, the high percentage of workers classified under 'other occupations' suggests a lack of clear professional identity and commitment, which can be detrimental to maintaining consistent work standards and efficiency. The transient nature of their employment status often leads to a workforce that is not only less skilled but also less invested in	1908	1988.5607
per ft. run at 30 f t./sec. D is the drift force in lbs per ft. run at 30 ft./sec.	The relationship between the drift force and the wind speed is not linear, implying that as the wind speed increases, the drift force does not simply proportionally increase but rather grows at a greater rate. This can be described mathematically by the square of the velocity, suggesting a quadratic relationship. Therefore, the drift force D can be expressed as: \[ D = k \times v^2 \] where \( k \) is a constant that depends on the characteristics of the material and environmental conditions such as air density and surface roughness, and \( v \) is the wind velocity in ft./sec. Given that \( D \) is measured at 30 ft./sec., if we need to find the drift force at a different velocity, we can rearrange the formula to: \[ D_{new} = D \times \left(\frac{v_{new}}{30}\right)^2 \] This formula allows us to calculate the drift force at any other velocity based on the known drift force at 30 ft./sec., adjusting for the quadratic increase with velocity.

Thrust coefficient ao = 0-1593. Torque coefficient bo = 0-01840.	Static efficiency = 48.9%. These experimental results provide a detailed analysis of the propeller's performance under various operating conditions. The data presented show how the propeller's efficiency and slip percentages change in relation to different translational and rotational speeds. In further analysis, it is evident that the efficiency generally decreases as the rotational speed increases. This trend is particularly noticeable in higher speed ranges, suggesting that the propeller experiences more significant energy losses at these speeds possibly due to factors such as increased drag and other hydrodynamic inefficiencies. The thrust and torque coefficients, which are critical indicators of the propeller's ability to convert rotational motion into useful work (thrust), also vary with changes in speed. The thrust coefficient generally increases with speed, indicating that the propeller is capable of generating more thrust at higher speeds. However, the increase in torque coefficient suggests that more torque is required to achieve these higher thrust levels, which corresponds to the reduced efficiency observed. This comprehensive set of data is crucial for optimizing propeller design to achieve better performance. By understanding how these variables interact, designers can make informed decisions	1912	1993.5425
VOL. LXXIX. — 28. AERODROME IN THE AIR DURING ITS Flight on Mat 6, 189G. would propel and sustain in horizontal flight at a velocity of about forty miles an hour a little over 200 pounds. Langley 's experiments were in the main made with a whirling table which forces the model to move in horizontal flight and at a fixed angle. In 1887, however, he began experiments with free flying models at the Allegheny Observatory, following Pinaud in using twisted rubber as motive power.	"By 1891, Langley had shifted focus to steam-powered models, which marked a significant advancement in his research into heavier-than-air flight. These models were considerably larger and heavier than the rubber-powered ones and required a more sophisticated approach to achieve sustained flight. The most notable of these, the Aerodrome No. 5, successfully flew for over half a mile in 1896, demonstrating the potential of steam propulsion in aviation. Langley's work was meticulous and thorough. He detailed every aspect of the flights, from the construction of the models to the atmospheric conditions during each test. His meticulous record-keeping and scientific approach laid important groundwork for those who would continue to push the boundaries of aviation. Furthermore, his insistence on the importance of power-to-weight ratio and aerodynamic design in flight influenced future aviation pioneers, including the Wright brothers, who would eventually make the first controlled, powered, and sustained heavier-than-air human flight in 1903. Langley's contributions, though initially met with skepticism and even public ridicule, especially after the failure of his later full-sized Aerodrome """	1911	1986.3861

The loyalty to the ideal values of life for which a new fighter and a new servant is to be won with every new boy and every new girl who enters into the class room is the common faith of every man and woman in the school. Not everyone is talented and not everyone is prepared to be a successful teacher. The good teacher cannot know enough and cannot train himself seriously enough, and yet no training and no knowledge can be a substitute for that true teacher's attitude. But we have no right to ignore the other side. Teaching is a practical work in which the means must be adapted to the end.	The pedagogical skill, the insight into human nature, the ability to awaken interest and to inspire, are as necessary as the mastery of the subject matter. Indeed, the true effectiveness of a teacher lies not merely in the knowledge they impart, but in their capacity to adjust that knowledge to the needs and capacities of the individual student. To touch the mind and heart of a pupil, to stimulate their native curiosity and guide their eager inquiries towards meaningful channels—this is the art of teaching. Therefore, while the idealism of teaching is upheld, it must also be recognized that teaching involves a craft to be honed. Practical strategies, classroom management, and the efficient use of resources play integral roles in the educational process. Each lesson becomes a balancing act between the ideal and the real, between the visionary goals of education and the daily tasks that must be performed to reach those goals. As such, a teacher must be both a dreamer and a doer. They must hold high the torch of ideal values, but also navigate the practical paths where those ideals can be effectively implemented. This dual challenge defines	1909	1897.8793
"Suffice it to say that his predisposition to vice through inheritance, the fearful effect upon him of intoxicants which seemed to lash his brain to madness and the indulgence in ultra stimulative food and drink in the two or three years immediately preceding his disgrace serve, in the eyes of the specialist in pathology and degeneracy, as indicative causes of his downfall and ruin. There survive from the days of imprisonment his greatest poem, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, and that soul autobiography De Profundis — morbid, pitiable, yet wonderful milange of confession and palliation, penance and defiance, self incrimination and exculpation. Wonderful document — true confession or .disingenuous plea, soul creed or soul blasphemy I"" These fragmentary extracts will serve to convey to the reader an intelligent idea of Professor Henderson's fine study of this intellectual comet. ""Maurice Maeterlinck — poet, mystic, transcendentalist, "" says our author, ""comes with gentle words of wise and aspiring sincerity to impress upon the world the belief that the development and disclosure of the human soul is the ultimate aim and goal of existence. ..."	He contends that the mysteries of life and death are not to be feared but embraced as profound lessons in the journey of the soul. Maeterlinck’s works, steeped in symbolic meaning and quiet contemplation, invite the reader to look beyond the material and grasp the ethereal, to understand that each moment and every entity is imbued with a purpose that transcends the apparent. His philosophy, though wrapped in the garment of simplicity, challenges the intellect to ascend to new heights of understanding and empathy. In contrast to the tumultuous and tragic narrative of Wilde, Maeterlinck’s prose offers a sanctuary of peace and introspection. His famous play, 'The Blue Bird', symbolizes the elusive pursuit of happiness that is often found within one's own heart after a long and arduous quest outward. This theme resonates deeply in an era marked by rapid change and uncertainty, suggesting that within the quietude of one's soul lies the clarity and contentment so desperately sought in external pleasures and achievements. Thus, while Wilde’s life and works serve as a cautionary tale of potential self	1911	1985.242
It is black on all the upper surface, and beneath of a beautiful carmine or red, each scale edged with black, the scales under the tail quite black. Its length reaches to 6 feet, but, though a few veterans have been killed which were 7 feet long, this is quite exceptional, and the Snake is quite large and dangerous enough if it reaches 5 feet. It subsists principally upon frogs, lizards, even the large blue tongued Lizards, and the smaller mammals. Krefft says that sixteen of the young of the Water Rat were taken out of one specimen, showing that the Snake had plundered four nests. Fifteen or twenty young ones are produced alive, appearing in March, when most of our Snakes bring forth their young. During the winter the Black Snake retires into holes in the ground. Like the Tiger Snake and the Copperhead, the Black Snake when angry flattens and distends the neck in Cobra fashion. It is a most venomous reptile, but will not attack man unless trodden upon, or cut off from means of escape. When swamps are drained, large numbers of the Snakes are often seen by the workmen.	This propensity to inhabit moist and marshy locales is what earns it the moniker of the Black Swamp Snake in some regions. Despite its fearsome reputation, it plays a crucial role in the balance of its ecosystem, controlling the populations of the small creatures it preys upon. The Black Snake, like many of its kind, exhibits a fascinating behavior when threatened. Initially, it may attempt to flee, but if escape is impossible, it resorts to a defensive posture. This involves raising the anterior part of its body and flattening its neck, much akin to the cobra, in an attempt to appear larger and more intimidating to potential predators or threats. This snake's venom is highly toxic and primarily neurotoxic, affecting the nervous system of its victim, leading to paralysis, and in severe cases, death if not treated promptly. Antivenom is effective in neutralizing the venom, but quick medical response is critical to ensure recovery. Interestingly, despite its potency, the Black Snake is relatively docile compared to other venomous snakes in its habitat and tends to avoid human contact as much as possible. 	1909	2006.1748
"Yet of the 333 pp. in this book only the first 50 are devoted to an estimate of these influences and this is largely coloured by the author's idealising tendency and fertile imagination. The rest of the book is concerned with suggestions for reform and discussion of large general principles — the sphere of the Individual and the State in Social Reform, a Minimum Wage, the Family as the ""training ground of relationships, "" the sort of religious teaching suitable to the young, etc. With much of this many of us will heartily agree; yet one cannot help grudging the space given to it, when the particular problem is of so absorbing an interest. If only Mr. Charles Booth, aided by a National Anthropometric Bureau and led to the spot by Mr. Bray, could give us an exact account of the facts and their causes, we could face Mr. Brav's categories of "" shoulds "" and "" oughts "" and "" insists "" with better hope of a sound judgement. As it is, the race after Mr. Bray's crowd of  ingenious but often fantastic reforms takes one's breath away and carries one off the field of patient and much needed investigation."	It is the meticulous detail and steadfast focus on empirical data that often yield the most substantive insights into social phenomena. What we require, therefore, is not merely a broad canvas painted with the idealistic brushstrokes of reform, but a granular scrutiny of societal elements. Mr. Bray, while commendably enthusiastic in his pursuit of societal betterment, perhaps overlooks the necessity of grounding his propositions in robust, empirical investigation. The importance of this rigorous approach becomes even more pronounced when considering the complexities of social issues such as minimum wage laws or family dynamics. These are areas where unintended consequences can proliferate if actions are based on insufficiently tested assumptions. The theoretical framework and philosophical postulations indeed have their place, but they must be continually cross-examined against the hard surface of observable reality. In conclusion, while the latter sections of the book engage with critical and timely topics, the lack of a solid empirical foundation somewhat undermines the potential effectiveness of the proposed reforms. What is needed is a balance between visionary reform and meticulous research, ensuring that our strides towards improvement are both bold and securely anchored in reality	1908	2003.1759

In this case using the same notation and like stresses, the direction and magnitude of the resultant stress on any plane can easily be found graphically by the following means. Describe, with O as centre (Fig. t6), two circles, CQD and ARB, their radii being proportional to A and A respectively.	From any point R on the circle ARB, draw a line RS parallel to the line OD in the circle CQD. The point S where this line intersects the circle CQD will represent the magnitude and direction of the normal stress on the plane passing through the point R. Similarly, draw a tangent to both circles at the point R; the length of this tangent from R to the point of tangency on CQD will represent the magnitude of the shear stress on the same plane. 17. Mohr's Circle for Stress Transformation. — This graphical method can be simplified and generalized using Mohr's circle. To construct Mohr's circle, plot the normal stresses on the horizontal axis and the shear stresses on the vertical axis. The centre of the circle, O, is at the midpoint of the line segment from (σ_x, τ_xy) to (σ_y, τ_yx), where σ_x and σ_y are the normal stresses in the x and y directions, respectively, and τ_xy and τ_yx are the shear stresses.

It has left in a place name the record of its passage, for, just as Stretton marks the crossing of the Mersey marshes by the Warrington Causeway, so does Stretford mark the crossing of the same marshes by the causeway leading to Manchester. To complete the strategical triangle there must have been a third road from Warrington to Manchester. It has disappeared, and perhaps Chatmoss has swallowed it up. From Warrington to Lancaster, and so to Overbarrow, ran a road which, north of Wigan, has mainly disappeared. From Man chester by way of Ribchester to Overbarrow   also ran a road which we can still trace. From this point, Overbarrow near Kirkby Lonsdale, a single road led northward.	"This road, known in parts as the ""old Roman road,"" wound through the rugged terrain, connecting smaller settlements and providing a vital link between the more populated centers. As it stretched northward, it passed through varying landscapes, from dense woodlands to open moorlands, each offering its own challenges and scenic views to the travelers of old. The road's importance was not merely practical but also held significant strategic value during times of conflict, serving as a critical route for the movement of troops and supplies. Over the centuries, the road witnessed numerous historical events, from Roman marches to medieval pilgrimages, each leaving an indelible mark on its course and character. Today, remnants of this ancient road can still be seen, with portions well-preserved and other sections reduced to mere footpaths or completely reclaimed by nature. Historians and archaeologists continue to study its route, piecing together maps and records to better understand the road's original course and its role in the historical connectivity of the region. The journey along this old road, whether for the casual hiker or the serious scholar, offers a"	1912	1996.0579
"On looking at the map we found that it was marked as the Nodus Gordii, or ""Gordian Knot"" ; so, really, it seemed an appropriate landing place for travellers who were desirous of solving mysteries. ""Very well, then, "" I said, ""we'll land there if you like, but I had rather a fancy for a different spot, which is on the Sinus Titanum. It is that place over there, near the point where the vegetation curves down in both directions, "" I remarked, as I pointed out the spot. "" Your place is rather nearer to the equator, and is probably pretty warm ; but really it does not matter where we land so long as we arrive on the planet. Your votes are two to my one ; so, as you have a thumping majority, go ahead, M'Allister, for the place you have chosen!"	"M'Allister, with a gleam of excitement in his eyes, nodded briskly as he began recalibrating the instruments for our descent. ""Right you are, then! Nodus Gordii it is. Let's unravel some mysteries, shall we?"" His enthusiasm was infectious, and despite my initial reservations, a spark of anticipation began to kindle within me as well. As the ship descended through the Martian atmosphere, the surface of the planet grew rapidly closer, revealing the intricate details of the landscape that had been mere abstractions on the map. The Nodus Gordii, as it turned out, was a complex terrain of intertwining canyons and plateaus that looked even more daunting up close. ""We're in for quite the adventure, it seems,"" I mused aloud, peering out of the viewport at the rugged expanse below. ""Yes, and perhaps it's the perfect place to test our resolve and our ingenuity,"" added our companion, Dr. Elara, her voice tinged with a mix of trepidation and thrill. ""Who knows what secrets this"	1911	1969.6653
"1 The moment to the right of B is M, and to the left is Mt, the difference being due to the pull in the wire acting at a point below the neutral axis. If E be Young's modulus and I the moment of inertia of the section, then the theorem of three moments becomes - • { M + M3V, } +1 {! JftT, + M'f, } = '+ ""*''' + ElQt - )DA second application of the theorem gives a second similar equation, and since the moment at the body end is zero and at the outer end can be calculated from the load on the cantilever section, the two equations are sufficient to determine M, and M If R Ri c. be the vertical components of the tension in the lift wires, see Fig."	12. Assuming equilibrium, the sum of moments about any point must equal zero. Thus, for the point B, taking moments about B and setting them to zero gives the basis for our calculations. Let L represent the span between supports and let P be the point load acting at a distance a from the left support. The reaction forces at the supports are then R1 and R2, such that R1 + R2 = P.  By taking moments about the left support, the equation becomes R2 * L = P * a, which allows us to solve for R2 as P * a / L. Since R1 + R2 = P, it follows that R1 = P - R2 = P - (P * a / L) = P(1 - a/L). We can now substitute these values into the moment equations. The moment at the left of B (denoted as M) and the moment to the right of B (denoted as Mt) can be related by the bending moment equation, which includes contributions from R1, R2, and the point	1912	1990.5416
lamp will be the same as that of a lamp of similar input using direct current. W. VIEWEGER (E.T.Z., April 18) points out that the recently imposed tax on carbons renders the need for economy more pressing, and suggests a method of making use of the residues left in the holders. Among other articles we note the results of some tests of incandescent lamps on electric railways in the United States (Elect. By. Journal, Feb. 24), from which it appears that wire drawn tungsten lamps are proving very acceptable. A writer in the Elektrolechnischer Anzeiger (March 7) analyses the costs of electric lighting with glow lamps of different c. p. and cost, and presents the results in tabular form. The Zeitschrifl fiir Beleuch tungswesen continues its series of articles on recent patents on the mounting of glowlamp filaments, new forms of arc lamps.	The focus of these articles is on the advancements in filament technology which has led to increased efficiency and longevity of the lamps. One particular study highlighted the shift from carbon filaments to tungsten, which offers not only better luminosity but also greater resistance to evaporation and thermal stress, thus significantly extending the service life of the lamps. This change is crucial for industrial applications where consistent and reliable lighting is essential. Furthermore, the Zeitschrift für Beleuchtungswesen discusses the implications of these technological advancements on energy consumption. With the newer, more efficient lamps, the potential for reduced operational costs is substantial. This is particularly relevant in the context of the new tax on carbons, as businesses and municipalities alike look for ways to decrease overheads in light of increased material costs. In addition to technical discussions, the journal also explores regulatory impacts on lighting technologies. Recent legislation aimed at phasing out less efficient lamps has spurred innovation, pushing manufacturers to develop and market products that meet these new stringent standards. This regulatory environment, while challenging, is fostering a rapid evolution in lighting technology, promising more energy-efficient	1912	1997.9968
But the woman suffragist here counters by insisting that she, as an individual, may have more physical force than an individual man. And it is quite certain — and it did not need suffragist raids and window breaking riots to demonstrate it — that women in the mass can bring a certain amount of physical force to bear. The true inwardness of the relation in which woman stands to physical force lies not in the question of her having it at command, but in the fact that she cannot put it forth without placing herself within the jurisdiction of an ethical law. The law against which she offends when she resorts to physical violence is not an ordinance of man, it is not written on the statutes of any State, it has not been enunciated by any human lawgiver.	It is a law written in the deeper instincts of her nature, in the very constitution of her physical and moral being. It clashes with the traditional and largely accepted vision of womanhood as characterized by nurturing, peace-making, and the more gentle persuasions of society. When a woman resorts to violence, she is seen not only as transgressing societal norms but as betraying an essential part of her own identity, as it has been historically and culturally constructed. This ethical dilemma is not merely philosophical; it has practical implications. For when a woman uses force, she often faces a disproportionately negative response, not just from the legal system but from public opinion as well. Her actions are likely to be judged more harshly than similar actions carried out by men, precisely because they conflict so sharply with entrenched expectations. This is the crux of the matter for the suffragist movement: the use of physical force, while it might temporarily advance their cause, could ultimately undermine it by reinforcing the very stereotypes and barriers they seek to dismantle. Thus, the suffragist must navigate a complex landscape. She must	1911	1997.236
"He'Ll be a man like the rest of us an' go to work, I tell you. So have done with your slobberin'; this morning he answers the whistle with me!"" McFane's big fist came down on the table. There was no appeal. In Mill town when the ""man"" — the breadwinner — spoke like that his word was law. Many a boy and youth in Milltown had heard that sentence passed and had gone to the ends of the earth as they knew them — mostly to the gutters and prisons. But Dave McFane was not that kind. The germ of order and obedience was in him. For a moment the wild spirit of revolt rose high, then flickered out in the knowledge of ugly facts, the misgivings of self. The sister had gone."	"She had slipped away in the night, a few years back, to escape the relentless grind and the stifling air of inevitability that hung over Milltown. She had sought something better, something beyond the narrow confines of the smoky skyline. Dave remembered her parting words, whispered hastily as if afraid of being overheard: ""Don't let this place eat you alive, Davey.""  Now, as he stood facing his father, those words echoed in his ears. The clatter of dishes as his mother cleared the table did nothing to drown them out. He looked down at his hands, rough and already calloused at such a young age, a testament to the sporadic work he had done around the mills to help out when times were tough. ""Alright, Da,"" Dave finally said, his voice steady but low. ""I'll go. But not forever. One day, I'll leave Milltown, just like Sis."" McFane's eyes, hardened by years in the mills and nights of worry over bills and bread, softened for a brief moment. Perhaps"	1913	1995.9127
"I wished heartily that I was seated beside my chauffeur in his fast receding car. "" However, my first object was to get clear of the wood again, and after some little time I emerged on the west side, right in the middle of a dressing station for the wounded, which had been established in a little hollow. Two surgeons, with their assistants, were already busily engaged with a number of wounded men, most of whom were badly hit by shrapnel bullets about the upper part of the body. I gathered from one or two of the few most slightly wounded men that our people had been, and were, very hardly put to it to hold their own. '"	"The air was thick with the acrid stench of gunpowder and the sharp tang of antiseptic. The ground around was churned up and littered with bandages and medical supplies, creating a stark contrast with the quiet woods from which I had just emerged. The surgeons moved with a grim efficiency that spoke of long hours and too many casualties, their faces set and focused under the brims of their helmets. One of the wounded, a young private with a bandaged arm, caught my eye and motioned me closer. His voice was hoarse but steady as he recounted the relentless advance of the enemy and the steadfast resistance of our troops. ""We're holding the line, but just barely,"" he whispered, his eyes dark with fatigue and pain. ""They keep coming, wave after wave. We push them back, but they don't stop."" As I listened, the sounds of distant artillery fire rolled over us, a grim reminder that the front line was not far. The surgeons continued their work, moving from one wounded soldier to another, their hands never still. The scene"	1906	1980.1471
This co operative spirit extends to all sorts of labour. Quaintly enough, this began in Italy with the long strings of jogging, primitive carts one sees upon the white Italian roads. The Apennines yield up masses of gravel to the persuasion of little rivers which sweep it down with torrential force and spread it along the lowlands to the Adriatic. From the river beds, almost empty at dry seasons, the gravel men fill their little carts with The Railway at Milan under Construction by co operative Workmen Vol. CXXV1I. — No. 761.	shovels and sturdy hands. It is a communal effort; each man knowing his neighbor and each sharing equally in the toil and profits. This same cooperative spirit is evident in the larger scale projects like the railway construction in Milan. There, under the bright Italian sun, groups of workmen, organized into cooperatives, lay down tracks and build infrastructure. They are not merely hired hands but stakeholders in their own right, sharing in the successes and setbacks of the project. Such cooperative work not only fosters a sense of community and mutual reliance but also instills a pride in the work that is often absent in more traditional labor arrangements. The men work not just for a paycheck but for the collective good and the improvement of their community. This ethos extends beyond the physical labor to the planning and management of the projects, where decisions are made democratically, allowing each worker a voice in the process. This model, rooted deeply in Italian culture with its emphasis on community and familial ties, shows a promising alternative to the impersonal and often exploitative labor practices found elsewhere. It is a testament to the	1913	1984.9016
"This valley seems to 67  afford another example of formation by the action of water. "" Amongst the three thousand peaks comprised in the Apennine range just below the Alps, are several mountains of considerable altitude, "" I remarked, pointing out Mount Huygens, nearly 20,000 feet high, Mount Hadley, 15,000 feet, and Mount Woolf, 12,000 feet in height. "" This range curves round towards the east, and finishes with a fine ring plain called Eratosthenes — some thirty-seven miles in diameter, with a floor depressed 8000 feet below the lunar surface. It encloses a central mountain, and on the east wall there is one peak which rises 16,000 feet above the floor. """	"""Indeed,"" I continued, ""the geological structure of the moon, as revealed through our telescopes, is a fascinating subject. The Apennines, with their rugged peaks and steep escarpments, offer a striking contrast to the smoother maria or seas, such as the Mare Imbrium over which they tower. The maria, once believed to be vast oceans, are now understood to be plains formed by ancient volcanic activity, their basaltic rocks reflecting less light than the surrounding highlands."" ""As we observe the moon's surface, we see evidence of extensive meteoric bombardment as well, which has played a significant role in shaping the lunar landscape. The countless craters, ranging from the massive to the minuscule, tell a story of a celestial body that has withstood the test of time against a barrage of cosmic impacts."" ""Turning our gaze back to Eratosthenes,"" I gestured towards the detailed lunar map spread out before us, ""this feature is particularly interesting not only for its size but also for its relatively preserved condition, which allows us to study"	1911	1921.7773
"There is said to be something more — and I believe there is — in the quality of the rays given out by various modes of lighting which it behoves illuminating engineers to study ; but I do not I hope that what I now propose to put on the screen will show that gas can satisfy practically all of the varying present day demands. Incandescent gas enables tradesmen of all descriptions to light their premises most excellently and safely, and, if, as already suggested, trade follows good lighting, it may be used not only as an illuminant, but also as a form of advertisement, and the enterprising tradesman can well and wisely say, "" Hang the expense if I double my takings : a few pounds spent  142 over good lighting is good business."" This, I think, all sides of the lighting industry will uphold. Fig. 3 gives my first illustration of shop lighting, namely, the exterior of Maynard's Confectionery Stores at Harringay. This style of lighting may be said to be typical of many shops well lighted by gas."	The shop front is bathed in a warm, inviting glow that not only enhances the visibility of the products within but also creates an ambiance of welcome that is hard to resist. The windows are clearly illuminated, showcasing the confectionery delights in their most tempting form, and the signage above is brilliantly lit, making it a beacon for those seeking sweet treats. Moving on to Fig. 4, we observe the interior of a boutique clothing store in Chelsea, also illuminated by gas. Here the focus is on creating a soft, diffuse light that flatters the merchandise and invites customers to inspect the quality of the fabrics. The clever arrangement of lighting fixtures ensures that there are no harsh shadows or overly bright spots that could distort the appearance of the colors and textures of the garments. In both cases, the use of gas lighting not only fulfills the functional requirement of illumination but also plays a crucial role in enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the stores. It is evident that gas lighting, with its ability to provide a range of lighting effects from the dramatic to the subtle, is perfectly capable of meeting the diverse needs of	1912	2006.3683

"They used to in my days."" But Newbury dismounted with only a footman to receive him, and Marcia did not appear till the gong had rung for luncheon. Sir Wilfrid's social powers were severely taxed to keep that meal going. Lady Coryston sat almost entirely silent and ate nothing. Marcia, too, ate little and talked less. Newbury indeed had arrived in radiant spirits, bringing a flamboyant account of Marcia's trousseau which he had extracted from a weekly paper, and prepared to tease her thereon. But he could scarcely get the smallest rise out of her, and presently he too fell silent, throwing uneasy glances at her from time to time."	"The atmosphere at the table grew increasingly strained as the meal progressed. Newbury tried once more to engage Marcia in conversation by bringing up a recent debate in Parliament which he knew interested her, but she responded only with a terse comment before lapsing back into silence. Sir Wilfrid, sensing the tension, attempted to lighten the mood with an anecdote from his younger days in politics, but even this failed to elicit more than a polite smile from his daughter. As dessert was served, Lady Coryston finally spoke, her voice cutting through the quiet with unexpected sharpness. ""I trust, Mr. Newbury, that amidst all this talk of trousseaus and parliamentary escapades, you have given thought to the more solemn responsibilities that await you and Marcia.""

"In a recent book, called "" The Village Labourer, "" by Mr. and Mrs. Hammond, there is an account of the aristocracy's land thefts from the populace and commoners of England. The sub title of that book is, "" A Study in the Government of England before the Reform Bill, 1760-1832."" One reads of the Duke of Portland, a land thief of no mean order, intriguing to obtain the striking off from the Commission of the Peace of Capel Lofft, a Suffolk Liberal, who had induced the Deputy sheriff to postpone the execution of a young girl for stealing. That is a measure of the hypocrisy of the English governing class. They robbed the poor of their remnants of land, and then sentenced them to death for the most trifling theft. One sees the members of Brooks' manipulating the Committees of the House of Commons to conceal their knaveries, and then departing to Quarter Sessions to amuse them the  Sunshine Girl"" Blousuit (as sketch)."	selves by sentencing some wretched poacher to transportation for the crime of trying to feed his family. The depth of the injustice is stark, and the Hammonds do not shy away from illuminating these grim realities of rural England. They paint a picture of a society deeply divided by wealth and power, where the aristocracy used the law as a tool to further their own interests at the expense of the common people. The book goes on to describe how enclosure acts, which were ostensibly meant to improve agricultural efficiency, were often manipulated to strip commoners of their traditional rights to common lands, thereby destroying their means of subsistence and forcing them into wage labor for the very aristocrats who had dispossessed them. This transformation was not just economic but also social and cultural, altering the very fabric of rural life. Through meticulous research, the Hammonds reveal how these acts of enclosure were not the result of impersonal economic forces but were driven by the greed and power of the landowning class, facilitated by a compliant government. The consequences of these actions were devastating: communities were dismantled, families	1911	1947.9147

Sundries -07: V. 1-6 The general synopsis of the advantages of the gas and electrically lighted streets are shown in the table on the opposite page. ME. ABADY'S SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (ABSTRACT).	In Mr. Abady's supplementary report, he carefully evaluates the efficiency and sustainability of gas versus electric street lighting. His findings suggest a marked superiority in electric lighting in terms of both luminosity and operational costs over the long term. The abstract of his report details the following key points: 1. **Energy Efficiency**: Electric lights consume less power per unit of light produced compared to gas lamps. This results in significant energy savings, especially when scaled to the infrastructure of an entire city. 2. **Maintenance and Reliability**: The maintenance costs for electric lights are lower than those for gas lamps. Electric lights offer greater reliability with a longer lifespan and fewer outages or malfunctions. 3. **Safety and Environmental Impact**: Electric lighting poses fewer safety risks such as fires or explosions, which are inherent risks with gas lamps. Additionally, electric lights produce no direct emissions, making them a more environmentally friendly option. 4. **Cost Analysis**: While the initial installation cost for electric lighting can be higher than gas, the long-term savings on energy consumption and maintenance offset these initial costs. The report includes a detailed cost	1912	2002.0858

But when I go to kiss him now, He tells me not to make a row, 'Cause mother hopes I'M not a baby yet. When I was little, papa used to tell Long stories to me every single night, And mama, 'cause she wasn't very well, Would lie by me and hold me — just as tight! But mother says I'M most half grown And ought to go to bed alone, And making fools of children isn't right. Once mother went away, I don't know where, And papa was alone, just him and I, And so I went and leaned against his chair And climbed up on his knee, and by and by He cuddled me, and rocked me, too, Like he and mama used to do, And then I felt so good, I had to cry.

"He was only an incident, and I hope the most romantic reader will let me revert from him to the Alcazar gardens. We were always rcverting to them on any pretext or occasion, and wo mostly had them to ourselves in the gentle afternoons when we strayed or sat about at will in them. The first day we were somewhat molested by the instruction of our patriotic Granadan guide, who had a whopper jaw and greyish blue eyes, but coal black hair for all his other blondness. He smoked incessant cigarettes, and he showed us especially the pavilion of Charles the Fifth, whom, after the use of all english speaking Spanish guides, he called "" Charley Fist."""	He narrated tales of the palace with a dramatic flair, mixing historical facts with local legends, and often digressing into personal anecdotes that reflected his deep-rooted love for Granada. Despite his engaging stories, we soon yearned for solitude, for the chance to experience the gardens without the filter of another's narrative.  So, after a polite but firm farewell to our guide, we found ourselves meandering along the tiled pathways alone, under archways heavy with climbing roses and past fountains that murmured like gentle conversations. The air was fragrant with the scent of jasmine and orange blossoms, and the sun, filtered through high cypress trees, cast a mosaic of light and shadow on the ground. The Alcazar gardens, with their intricate Moorish architecture and lush vegetation, seemed to hold within them the whispers of ages. Here, the past was not just recounted but felt. Each leaf and stone seemed imbued with stories, and the serene atmosphere lent itself to quiet contemplation. As we wandered, the world outside the high garden walls seemed increasingly distant, as if we had	1913	1962.9884

Olives bear heavily and are a profitable crop. The Valley olive oil is pure and delicious. Almonds, peaches, pears, apricots, figs and grapes of various kinds thrive here. Here are to be found more ostriches than in all the United States besides; while cattle, horses, mules, hogs and sheep develop and fatten rapidly. With an altitude above sea level of about eleven hundred feet, the Salt River Valley enjoys a climate superb for eight months in the year and remarkably healthful, even if somewhat warm, the other four months. The summer heat is dry and sunstrokes of man or beast are almost unknown, as well as diseases peculiar to children in the summer.	The winters are mild and pleasant, with only occasional frosts which seldom harm the hardier crops. The air during these cooler months is crisp and invigorating, making it an ideal time for outdoor activities and agricultural pursuits. The soil of the valley is remarkably fertile, a rich alluvial deposit that has accumulated over centuries from the seasonal floodwaters of the Salt River. This soil, combined with the ample sunshine and a well-managed irrigation system, allows for a year-round growing season. The irrigation system, a marvel of local ingenuity, taps into the river, distributing water through a network of canals that traverse the landscape. This system is the lifeblood of the valley, ensuring that even during the driest months, the fields remain verdant and productive. The community here is deeply connected to the land, with generations of families working the same plots, nurturing the soil, and reaping the benefits of their labor.

"""Grown weary of railroad extortion and arrogance, a lot of farmers out here in Western Iowa have solved the railway problem by getting out and building a railroad for themselves. The new road — the Atlantic Northern & Southern — is fifty-five miles in length, runs through one of the very richest sections of Western Iowa, and has started in business without a dollar's worth of assistance from any of the great financial concerns, or as for that matter, from anyone other than the farmers and business men of the towns along the right of way. All the cash was subscribed by the farmers and most of the actual construction work was done by men of that class. And, incidentally, in the matter of construction, it can be said that these farmers set a pace that out distanced anything the professional railroad builders ever accomplished in the west. ""The road is not an electric interurban, but is a finished, standard guage, steam line, with locomotives, passenger and freight cars, depot, telegraph and express service, and all necessary equipment for a railroad of that length."	The construction of the Atlantic Northern & Southern was a marvel of community effort and self-reliance. It was the farmers themselves who surveyed the route, cleared the path, and laid down the tracks. Local blacksmiths contributed by forging parts of the hardware needed for the construction. Even the local women and children helped, providing meals and aid to the workers in the fields. Every tie, every rail laid, represented not just a physical contribution, but a stake in their own economic future and an act of defiance against the monopolistic practices that had so long hampered their prosperity. The Atlantic Northern & Southern quickly proved its worth. Within its first year of operation, it had dramatically reduced the shipping costs for local produce, thus enabling farmers to compete more effectively in broader markets. Grain, livestock, and dairy products could now reach cities further east at a fraction of the previous costs, and the economic benefits were palpable through the rise in local farm incomes. Moreover, the railroad became a symbol of pride and independence. It was more than just a means of transport; it was a tangible manifestation of what	1911	1963.1278
The northerly winds of winter, however, blowing the length of the dunes, break down the sharp crests and build crescents which give the summits of the ridges a toothed effect like a saw. In addition minor ridges may connect two parallel dunes, but it is possible to ride for many miles along a clean swept lane of sopag a quarter to a half mile wide, between the dunes which rise on either hand to a height of a hundred feet or more. The first section of the journey lay along the sandstone escarpment from the village of Nadura in Kharga to the little villages of Tenida, Smint, Mut, Rashida, and Dahkla, in the oasis of Dahkla, r .-* Rounded Hills of the Libyan Desert worn by the Wind  494 about one hundred miles to the westward. Both oases are in the same general depression not many feet above sea level, and it was on the track between them that the first opportunity for close examination of the desert was afforded.	The journey was arduous, with the sun beating down relentlessly and the vast expanse of sand stretching endlessly before them. The travelers, equipped with their camels and minimal supplies, moved at a steady pace, aware of the need to conserve energy in the oppressive heat. As they progressed, the landscape revealed its subtle nuances—the way the light played on the sand, creating shifting patterns and shadows, and the occasional appearance of hardy desert plants clinging to life in such barren conditions. The wind was a constant companion, sometimes a gentle whisper, other times a howling force that rearranged the topography of the dunes before their very eyes. It was during one of these windy episodes that they noticed the peculiar formation of the dunes, which seemed almost sculptural, carved by the invisible hand of the wind into delicate crescents and sharp ridges. As they approached the oasis of Dahkla, the scenery began to change. The stark, monochrome world of sand was gradually replaced by hints of greenery. Palm trees appeared like mirages at first, then solidified into welcoming shades	1913	2005.5189
"Strong, mobile brows, thin, fastidious nose, and lips reserved and sensitive sprang into view, were coloured ruddily for an instant, and were merged in the dark again as he dropped the match and raised his head. It was like seeing a personality created and annihilated in the same instant. "" We'Ll walk round and visit the sentries, "" he said, settling his belt above his hips as he moved from the door. "" Very good, sir, "" replied Lieutenant Schmidt, formally, falling into step at his side. About them, as they went along the road, the orchards were festal with promise under the moon. It was as Lieutenant Schmidt had said; the great war in which their country was engaged sounded here no echo. It had flowed over the borders like a pestilence, but hither it had not come. Their sixty men and their twelve wagons of explosives, with which they were sent to feel their way toward some projected scene of action, were the first shapes of war which the village had seen."	"The road under their feet was soft with the dust of summer, and the air was filled with the scent of apple blossoms, a sharp contrast to the acrid smell of gunpowder and metal they had grown accustomed to. As they continued their patrol, the quiet of the night was punctuated only by the occasional rustle of leaves or the distant call of a night bird, the serenity almost surreal given the turmoil engulfing their homeland. Captain Lang's eyes, accustomed to searching out danger, scanned the shadows thrown by the moonlight, his mind never quite at ease despite the peaceful surroundings. Lieutenant Schmidt, younger and less worn by the scars of battle, allowed himself a moment of reflection on the beauty of the night, a luxury rarely afforded in the trenches. They approached the first sentry post, where a young soldier snapped to attention at their approach. ""All quiet, sir,"" he reported, his voice barely above a whisper as if reluctant to break the silence of the night. ""Keep alert, we're not on holiday,"" Captain Lang responded curtly, his tone gentle but"	1913	1982.3706
Church gives its luminosity as 48-6. Mr. Trotter said that he had just begun to make some experiments upon a subject which was perhaps within the title of the paper, namely, ' Colour Discrimination by Artificial Daylight.' Twenty years ago he read a paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers on ' Notes on the Electric Arc ' (vol. xxi. p. 360, 1892), and gave the spectrum intensity curves of Abney for sunlight and for flat flame gas light, which was practically the same as the carbon glow lamp, and for the electric arc. He showed that if they subtracted the one from the other, the difference was a representation of the absorption curve which had to be dealt with, and he was quite surprised that, after these twenty years, no one had worked out this important matter, namely, to reproduce artificial daylight.	"He continued by explaining that the key to effective color discrimination under artificial conditions lay in the ability to replicate the spectrum of natural daylight as closely as possible. Mr. Trotter then introduced his latest work, which involved experimenting with different types of light sources and filters to manipulate the light spectrum. He had focused on the use of LED technology, which offered the potential for precise control over emitted wavelengths. ""The challenge,"" Mr. Trotter elaborated, ""is to adjust the spectral power distribution of the light source so that it mirrors the continuum of daylight. This involves not only the visible spectrum but also the subtle gradations that affect color perception."" He shared preliminary results that showed promising improvements in color rendering, especially in the rendering of blues and reds, which are often problematic under typical artificial lighting conditions. To quantify these improvements, Mr. Trotter had employed a series of color rendition tests, comparing objects under his experimental lighting to their appearance under natural daylight. ""Ultimately,"" he concluded, ""the goal of this research is not merely academic. It has practical applications in fields such as textile industry, where accurate"	1912	2007.441
On the other hand, the New Parliament is not so bound that it can never under any circumstances adopt any special agenda for the occasion, or even, on cause being shown, permit some temporary form of chairmanship, due to the special difficulties of the subject or the intrusion of old world habits into the new sphere, the true method being to cultivate the sense that each member is equally responsible both for the maintenance of order and for the observance of the sequence of ideas in debate. The practice in regard to secretaries and the keeping of records generally is subject to the same kind of analysis. Coming to the equally vexed question of votes, in the light of the voluntary principle, there is more than one kind of voting — that which is merely a quick method of recording a fact, or registering a pious opinion, without resultant action, is harmless and often convenient. A vote which binds the action of those who are outvoted to a course of conduct which they disapprove would be inadmissible except in the direst emergency.	Votes that involve significant consequences or dictate a particular line of action should be approached with the utmost care and consideration. Ideally, such decisions would be reached by consensus or near-consensus, reflecting a broad agreement or at least a substantial majority that acknowledges and respects minority viewpoints. In cases where consensus cannot be achieved, it may be necessary to reconsider the proposal itself, seeking adjustments that could lead to wider agreement. Furthermore, the method of voting should be transparent and designed to ensure that every member's voice is heard and valued. This might involve anonymous voting to protect individual opinions from undue influence or pressure, or it could entail open roll-call votes where members publicly stand by their decisions, fostering accountability. In implementing these principles, the role of the chair or facilitator becomes crucial. This person must not only manage the flow of debate and enforce rules of order but also encourage inclusive and respectful discussion. They should strive to ensure that all members have equal opportunities to contribute, helping to navigate through complex issues and mediating when disagreements arise. As for the record-keeping, it should be meticulous yet flexible, capturing the essence	1911	1995.107
Exact calculation of the motion in a vibrating elastic system is often a matter of great complexity, but very closely approximate calculations are frequently very simple. Three kinds of vibration of straight bars will be considered, viz. Longitudinal, Transverse, and Torsional vibrations, the elastic forces being those arising from longitudinal, bending, and twisting strains of the bar. In many cases the inertia of the bar is negligible in comparison with that of attached masses, while in other cases the attached masses may be zero or their inertia negligible in comparison with that of the rod. 159. Free or Natural Vibrations.	In free or natural vibrations, the system oscillates without the continuous input of external forces, following an initial disturbance. The frequency at which these oscillations occur is known as the natural frequency of the system. This frequency is determined by the physical properties of the system, such as mass distribution, stiffness, and boundary conditions. For longitudinal vibrations, the motion occurs along the length of the bar, with particles moving parallel to its axis. The frequency for such vibrations can be calculated using the formula \( f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}} \), where \( L \) is the length of the bar, \( E \) is the Young's modulus of the material, and \( \rho \) is the density. Transverse vibrations, on the other hand, involve motion perpendicular to the length of the bar. Here, the bar bends back and forth, similar to the motion of a plucked string. The basic frequency of transverse vibration is given by \( f = \frac{1}{2L^2} \sqrt{\frac	1908	1957.2386
""" It is not unlikely that the possibility, or the actual occurrence, of such horrors as these may eventually bring about the cessation of war between the more civilised nations; and, as the uncivilised are gradually brought under control, there may be federations — not necessarily amalgamations — of two or more nations. In the slow process of time these may unite in larger and more comprehensive federations, until at last the whole world will be embraced within them. This, of course, is looking ages ahead of our present times. """	"""However, the seeds of such universal peace are already sown in the existing treaties and alliances, the international courts, and the general sentiment which increasingly favors arbitration over conflict. The growing interdependence of nations in trade and commerce, in science and culture, likewise fosters a mutual understanding and a common interest that transcends borders and diminishes the likelihood of armed conflict. Indeed, the trend towards globalization, though fraught with its own challenges and inequities, suggests a move away from isolated national interests towards a more unified global perspective. Moreover, the devastating potential of modern warfare, with weapons that could annihilate entire cities in moments, impels rational leaders to consider peace not merely as a moral ideal, but as an imperative for survival. The horrors of war, once localized and limited to the battlefield, now have the potential to affect civilian populations on an unprecedented scale, making the cost of war too great to bear.

The normal force becomes the lift when the machine is in the attitude of steady horizontal flight. The three couples or moments are those tending to produce rolling, pitching and yawing respectively. Complete measurements of these component forces and couples have been made on models of complete aeroplanes, and the results obtained will no doubt engage the attention of designers. They have been employed in the discussion of the stability of the types tested, referred to later. Tests of aeroplane bodies. — Some determinations have been made of the forces and moments acting on models of aeroplane bodies, and also on a model body with tail plane, and both with and without the rudder and elevator planes.	These experiments are critical as they help to understand how various modifications affect the aerodynamics of the aircraft. The results indicate how alterations in design, such as changes in the size or angle of the tail plane, rudder, and elevators, can influence the stability and control of the aircraft during flight. For instance, the addition of a tail plane generally enhances stability by providing additional lift at the rear of the aircraft, balancing the aerodynamic forces along the length of the body. This is particularly important during maneuvers that involve changes in pitch. Similarly, the rudder and elevators play pivotal roles in controlling yaw and pitch respectively, allowing the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively. Further, these tests have shown that the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft can be significantly impacted by the shape and configuration of the fuselage. Streamlined bodies tend to reduce drag and improve air flow around the aircraft, which can lead to higher speeds and more fuel-efficient flight. The implications of these findings are substantial for designers. By understanding the specific impacts of each component's design on the overall aerodynamics, designers can make informed decisions	1912	2001.4576

Each of these cases presents unique legal precedents concerning the interpretation and enforcement of municipal contracts, highlighting the complexities of local government obligations and the judicial scrutiny thereof. In Stuart v. Cambridge, the court held that the city had a duty to fulfill its contract with regards to public works, emphasizing the binding nature of such agreements once duly entered into. Conversely, in Liller v. Jayne, the court found that certain contractual conditions were unenforceable as they contravened public policy, thereby underscoring the limitations imposed by overarching legal principles on municipal contract powers. These judicial interpretations are critical in understanding the constraints and powers of municipalities in contract law. They delineate the scope within which city councils and local governments can operate, balancing contractual obligations with statutory duties and public policy considerations. Such cases also provide a framework for resolving disputes that arise from municipal contracts, offering guidance on issues ranging from contract formation to performance and enforcement.

"Kill them ! Kill them ! "" Many of the London women now became perfect furies. So incensed were they at the wreck of their homes and the death of their loved ones that they rushed wildly into the fray with no thought of peril, only of bitter revenge. A German, whenever caught, was at once killed. In those bloody street fights the Teutons got separated from their comrades and were quickly surrounded and done to death. Across the whole of the northern suburbs the scenes of bloodshed that night were full of horror, as men fought in the ruined streets, climbing over the smouldering debris, over the bodies of their comrades, and shooting from behind ruined walls. As Von Kronhelm had anticipated, his Army was compelled to light its way into London."	But what he had not foreseen was the fiery spirit of resistance that every man and woman in the city would display. The Londoners, fueled by desperation and loss, transformed their familiar streets into a labyrinth of ambushes. Every shadow could hide a sniper, every alley could erupt with a sudden charge of defenders. The air was thick with smoke and the sharp tang of gunpowder, the ground slick with blood as the battle raged without respite. The invaders, trained and equipped for war, found themselves embroiled in a new kind of conflict. It was not just a military operation; it was a battle for survival against an entire population inflamed by the ravages of war on their doorstep. The ferocity of the Londoners surprised the German troops, slowing their advance and inflicting heavy casualties. Amidst the chaos, stories of heroism and tragedy unfolded. A group of residents from East End, armed with nothing more than kitchen knives and sheer determination, managed to reclaim their block by setting a cunning trap that led to the capture of a German unit.

From after nausea they are almost wholly free. One physician of twenty five years' practice has never had a death from chloroform, although he has not administered aether half a dozen times. The fact is, however, they stolidly endure operations which we would never perform without an anaesthetic. Small tumours are usually thus removed and in extracting teeth gas is never administered. Sometimes extensive cutting — e. g., the removal of a tumour reaching down into and involving the excision of the decayed end of a rib — is born without flinching. Only three physicians interviewed had failed to remark the insensibility of their patients to pain. Here, perhaps, is the reason why no people in the world have used torture so freely as the Chinese.	Their traditional medicine and practices reflect a stoicism that is deeply ingrained in their culture. It is not uncommon for patients to undergo painful procedures with little more than herbal concoctions to dull the senses. This tolerance, or perhaps resignation, to physical pain is mirrored in historical accounts of judicial and punitive measures, where the use of torture was not only a means of punishment but also a method of extraction of confessions or information. Moreover, this apparent insensitivity has influenced the way traditional Chinese medicine has developed over the centuries. Techniques such as acupuncture, which involves the insertion of needles into specific points of the body, and cupping, a form of therapy that uses suction, are based on principles that might seem excruciating to those unfamiliar with the practices. Yet, they are commonly accepted and widely used throughout Chinese society. This cultural disposition towards enduring pain without complaint may also shed light on the broader philosophical and spiritual frameworks that emphasize endurance and forbearance as virtues. Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, which have shaped Chinese thought for millennia, all promote forms of self-control and an	1911	1993.4769
Petrol shells were not used against the Forest, as Von Kronhelm had given orders that it was not to be burned if it could possibly be avoided. The shrapnel was very successful in keeping down the fire from the edge of the trees, but our troops received a good deal of damage from infantry and guns that were posted to the east of the Forest on a hill near Theydon Bois. But about seven o'clock these troops were driven from their position by a sudden flank attack made by the IXth Corps from Theydon Mount. Von Kleppen followed this up by putting some of his own guns up there, which were able to fire on the edge of the Forest after those  of the Xth Corps had been masked by the close advance of their infantry.	The engagement intensified as the IXth Corps, emboldened by their success at Theydon Mount, pressed forward with relentless vigor. The woods echoed with the cacophony of gunfire and the sharp orders of commanders urging their men onwards. The artillery from Von Kleppen's newly positioned guns thundered, sending shells arcing through the sky to burst among the trees where the enemy had taken cover.  As the shadows lengthened and dusk approached, the battle reached a fever pitch. The Xth Corps, not to be outdone by their counterparts, launched a series of aggressive maneuvers aimed at dislodging the remaining enemy forces entrenched near the southeast perimeter of the Forest. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and the forest floor trembled under the relentless barrage. Meanwhile, the enemy, realizing the precariousness of their position, began a strategic withdrawal, attempting to regroup at a more defensible location further east. The retreat was harried and chaotic, under constant pressure from Von Kleppen’s artillery and the advancing infantry of the IXth Corps. As night fell,	1906	1974.1476
Passing on to the effect of light on coloured objects, the lecturer showed some experiments illustrating the enormous colour distortion which might be caused by illumination with pure red, green, or blue light. Such effects were present (to a smaller degree) in the case of artificial illuminants whose spectrum differed from that of daylight. This naturally led to a brief explanation of Mr. Ritchie's recent researches, some slides kindly lent by him for the purpose being shown; and Mr. Dow also explained the Mees daylight unit, which, by the courtesy of Benjamin Electric, Ltd., he had an opportunity of exhibiting. A series of colour boxes lent from the Holophane laboratory were also shown.	The colour boxes, each containing differently colored materials, demonstrated vividly how the same object might appear drastically different under various lighting conditions. Mr. Dow continued to expound how these variations affect the perception of colour in everyday life, emphasizing the importance of considering the light source when assessing the colour of objects. He went on to discuss the principle of metamerism, where two objects with different spectral reflectances appear the same under one light source but differently under another. To further illustrate this phenomenon, Mr. Dow conducted a live demonstration using a set of metameric fabrics. Under the Mees daylight unit, the fabrics appeared identical, but when switched to a standard incandescent light, the colours diverged noticeably. This effectively highlighted the challenges faced in industries where accurate colour matching is crucial, such as in textile manufacturing and graphic design. The lecture concluded with an interactive Q&A session, where attendees raised questions about practical applications of these concepts in various fields, including photography and retail lighting. Mr. Dow provided insightful responses, suggesting ways to mitigate colour distortion through careful selection of lighting solutions. The session underscored	1912	1992.3707

The development of the industry is also markedly influenced by the feedback loop between consumers and manufacturers, facilitated by these comprehensive marketing efforts. As consumers grow more aware of the subtleties of light quality, color temperature, and energy efficiency, their demands become more sophisticated. Manufacturers, in response, innovate and refine their products to meet these evolving needs. This dynamic has led to significant advances in bulb technology, including the rise of LED lighting, which offers longer lifespans and greater energy efficiency than traditional incandescent bulbs. Collaborations among scientific researchers, industrial engineers, and marketing teams have enabled the creation of lighting solutions that not only conserve energy but also cater to the health and aesthetic needs of consumers. For instance, lighting systems today can mimic natural light patterns to enhance productivity and well-being in workplace environments. The emphasis on human-centric lighting design is a direct result of the industry's focus on consumer feedback and its integration into product development. Furthermore, the push towards sustainability has encouraged companies to adopt greener manufacturing processes and to design products that are both recyclable and less harmful to the environment. This shift	1912	2004.9901
The war against war that has been waged has substantially increased the army of thinking men and women who have taken an unequivocal stand for international peace. The proposed American treaty with Great Britain — a treaty that if ratified will doubtless be followed by similar treaties with the Republic of France and other nations, is a striking illustration of the rapid advance which has marked the peace propaganda of recent years. If this treaty should be ratified, it would, we believe, prove the greatest and most far reaching advance move /  454 merit in favour of world peace that has yet materialised. A work that is even greater in its potential value is the Carnegie Endowment.	This institution, founded with the noble aim of advancing international peace and understanding, has dedicated itself to fostering education and dialogue among nations. Through its various divisions, it supports research, higher education, and the direct mediation in international disputes, creating platforms where ideas and strategies for peace can be openly discussed and developed. Moreover, the Endowment's efforts in promoting historical and cultural exchanges have been instrumental in softening national prejudices which often serve as barriers to mutual understanding. Through grants and fellowships, scholars and practitioners from diverse backgrounds are able to conduct research that sheds light on the underlying causes of conflicts, and on strategies that can prevent them. The influence of such an organization is profound. By addressing the root causes of war and by promoting a culture of peace and scientific approach to policy-making, the Carnegie Endowment not only contributes directly to the reduction of conflicts but also helps in shaping a global environment where diplomatic solutions are the norm, and warfare is a last resort. This, coupled with treaty agreements like the proposed American treaty with Great Britain, represents a holistic approach to achieving lasting global peace.	1911	2000.0345

Propeller So. Experimental mean pitch = T'JU Jeet.	Propeller No. 1 had an experimental mean pitch of 7.90 feet, showing a slight deviation from the theoretical design which predicted a pitch of 8.00 feet. This variance can be attributed to the practical adjustments made during the production process, which often slightly alter the theoretical values. Propeller No. 2, on the other hand, demonstrated a closer alignment with its theoretical pitch, recording an experimental mean pitch of 8.05 feet against a designed pitch of 8.00 feet. This slight increase could be due to the material expansion under operational conditions, a common occurrence in aerodynamic components subjected to various atmospheric pressures and temperatures. The performance of these propellers under different speeds and loads was also recorded. For instance, at a speed of 2500 RPM and a load of 200 lbs, Propeller No. 1 achieved a thrust of 320 lbs, whereas Propeller No. 2 achieved a thrust of 335 lbs. This indicates that despite the minor discrepancies in pitch, the propellers perform efficiently under operational stresses. Further tests were conducted to measure	1912	1990.72
"After calling attention to the beneficent effects following the introduction and practice of the water cure, the discovery of anaesthetics, the use of medical electricity, massage, etc., Professor James continued: ""Some of these therapeutic methods arose inside of the regular profession; others outside of it. In all cases they have appealed to experience for their credentials. But experience in medicine seems to be an exceedingly difficult thing. Take homoeopathy, for instance, now nearly a century old. An enormous mass of experience, both of homoeopathic doctors and their patients, is invoked in favour of the efficiency of these remedies and doses. But the regular profession stands firm in its belief that such experience is worthless, and that the whole history is one of quackery and delusion. In spite of the rival schools appealing to experience, their conflict is much more like that of two philosophers of two theologists. Your experience, says one side to the other, simply isn't fit to count. . ."	It is not founded on the proper method, nor is it measured against the appropriate standards of scientific scrutiny. The debates continue, each side upholding its own interpretations and methodologies, and neither willing to concede any ground to the other. This scenario isn't unique to homoeopathy alone; many alternative practices face similar criticisms and defenses. This polarization in the medical field, as in many other fields of human inquiry and practice, illustrates the immense challenge of defining what constitutes valid knowledge and experience. It raises fundamental questions about the nature of evidence and the criteria by which it should be evaluated. How are we to judge the reliability and value of different types of experience? What role should personal testimonies play in the scientific validation of medical treatments? In the pursuit of answers, perhaps what is needed is a more integrative approach that respects and combines the strengths of both traditional and non-traditional methods. Such an approach would not only broaden the scope of tools available for healing but also potentially bridge the divide between conflicting medical philosophies. By fostering a culture of open-mindedness and rigorous scientific inquiry, we might better	1911	1981.6997
America's most brilliant humorist employed all the power of ridicule to discredit the founder of Christian Science and the movement. As a result of this campaign of misrepresentation, slander and villification, the cause of Christian Science, instead of receiving a deathblow, rapidly spread. People began to investigate for themselves and many through such investigation became ardent adherents of the movement. Now the opposition pursued new tactics.	They sought to legally challenge the practice of Christian Science healing, labeling it as quackery and dangerous to public health. Legislatures were petitioned, and court cases were initiated to restrict or even ban the activities of Christian Science practitioners. Debates raged in newspapers and public forums, with critics arguing that Christian Science healing was unscientific and relied on placebo effects rather than medical science. However, the fervor of these attacks only served to ignite further interest. Books and articles defending the principles and successes of Christian Science multiplied, testimonials from those claiming to have been healed by its methods were widely published, and lectures were held in cities and towns across the country. In response to legal challenges, Christian Scientists organized more formally, establishing state committees on publication to disseminate correct information and counteract misinformation, and legal defense funds to protect practitioners against prosecution. Despite ongoing opposition, the Christian Science movement continued to grow, its adherents bolstered by a sense of persecution which, paradoxically, lent strength to their community. They argued that the very resistance they encountered was evidence of the transformative power of their faith,	1911	1986.8379
Such play, of course, shows all the traits of the little personality and while external stimulations for play which grownup people bring to the child are mostly conventional, traditional, and uniform, the child is welcome to select his play and the means of it in accordance with his particular nature. The kindergarten, on the whole, will still follow the maxim that the child may be left to his immediate attention most of the time, although even there wise management will begin serious training of voluntary attention. But if to a certain degree the merrier method is permissible, these kindergarten schemes certainly should not overrun the school. Our present tendencies, however, indicate that the chief influence comes from above. It is the university which has shaped the college, and the college has influenced at first the high school and slowly even the primary  267   school.	Thus, we observe a downward percolation of educational ideals and methods, which, while enriching in some aspects, may not always be appropriately tuned to the developmental needs and capacities of younger learners. It's imperative to consider that what suits a university student in terms of self-directed learning and critical inquiry might not be as fitting for a child in the nascent stages of formal education. The primary school, in its essence, should cultivate the foundational skills—literacy, numeracy, basic scientific understanding, and social skills—that are crucial for all later educational endeavors. Moreover, while the influence of higher education institutions is profound, the primary and secondary educational levels must retain their unique focus on fostering basic competencies and inspiring a love for learning in a manner that is accessible and engaging to young minds. The joy and curiosity which play and less structured educational methods engender in young children are not merely frivolous activities; they are crucial to developmental growth and intrinsic motivation. Therefore, while we can appreciate the trickle-down of academic rigor and enriching content from higher institutions, it must be adapted thoughtfully and creatively	1909	1999.0194

Furthermore, it should be distinctly shown that in any dictionary representing cultivated speech a great deal contained in these vocabularies would be as much out of place as would be the cockneyisms of London or dialectic words and phrases of anywhere in a dictionary representing the speech of the educated class of England. The peculiar difficulty of separating with us the local from the general may be conceded. In no other country does change of residence take place on so grand a scale. A population as restless as the sea wave is wandering constantly hither and thither. Not only do comparatively few die where they are born, but the distance which separates the cradle from the grave is often the breadth of a continent. It is inevitable under such conditions that peculiar expressions which characterise the speech of one part of the country should be transported to another and frequently a remote part. This involves special labour and difficulty in tracing the original home of many words and phrases, as well as the extent to which they have spread.	Thus, a lexicographer tasked with the compilation of a dictionary that aims to reflect a national standard must exercise considerable discernment. The challenge is not merely to document the language as it is spoken, but to sift through the myriad local variations and colloquialisms to find those expressions that have gained wide acceptance and can be considered part of the cultivated national lexicon. This task is compounded by the American penchant for innovation and adaptation in language, where new expressions are as swiftly coined as they are spread by the mass media and the mobility of the population. The process of standardization, therefore, involves not only identifying widespread usage but also making normative choices about what constitutes the standard language. This is often a matter of delicate judgment, balancing the descriptive aspects of lexicography, which aim to capture the language as it is used, against the prescriptive, which seek to define how it should be used according to a certain set of cultural values.  In this endeavor, the lexicographer must be both a careful observer and a judicious editor, deciding which elements of the language are ephemeral	1913	1997.0558
"These facts point necessarily to certain conclusions."" "" I suppose they do. They seem to me to make the whole thing rather more confused ; but then I'M not a detective."" ""I am."" ""Would you mind telling me — ?"" ""The letter, "" said the Colonel, ""was evidently taken out of the postoffice on Monday evening, opened, and readdressed at some time during Monday night, and posted again on Tuesday morning, by some person who used blue black ink, bought stationery at a distance, and wrote the hand of an educated lady. You follow me so far?"" I followed him perfectly, although I knew that the letter had been in the pocket of my coat all Monday night, and that the first part of the Colonel's statement was entirely wrong. I did not, however, attempt to correct him. We should not have been any nearer knowing who opened the letter if I, at that eleventh hour, had confessed my share in the crime. "" Don'T keep me in suspense, "" I said. "" Tell me who it is that you suspect."""	"The Colonel leaned forward, his eyes narrowing as he scrutinized my face for any sign of reaction. ""I suspect,"" he said slowly, ""that it was Miss Harriet Vane. Her handwriting matches the script on the readdressed envelope, and she purchased a bottle of blue-black ink from a small stationer's shop not three blocks from here last week."" I felt a jolt of surprise, not least because I knew Miss Vane well enough to doubt her involvement in any underhanded activities. Yet, the Colonel's evidence was compelling, and his confidence unnerving. ""But why,"" I managed to ask, ""would she do such a thing? What could possibly be her motive?"" ""That,"" the Colonel replied, tapping his fingers on the table, ""is indeed the heart of the mystery. Miss Vane has always been a bit of an enigma. Perhaps she had some information she needed to confirm or deny, or perhaps there was a message in that letter pertinent to her own interests."" I pondered this, the wheels in my mind turning rapidly. It seemed too"	1913	1970.955
"So strong already was French interest in all that savoured of England that Provost was able to gain his living by the publication of a review, the Pour et contre, in each number of which he promised to recount some "" new and striking feature of the English genius or the curiosities of London and other parts of the island "" — a programme to which he adhered very faithfully and in accordance with which he consecrated in 1738 a considerable portion of his space to the Life and Works of Shakespeare A quotation from this long and important article will furnish testimony to the rapid rising of the critical barometer towards the fever heat of later years. Prevost, like his predecessors, notes that Shakespeare was unacquainted with the poets of antiquity; but, he asks, with perfect freedom from prejudice, was that a disadvantage ?8 "" It is certain that that knowledge would have helped to make him more correct; but it may also be believed that the regularity to which he would have tried to constrain himself in imitation of them would have caused him to lose something of that warmth, of that impetuosity, and of that admirable delirium, if one may so phrase it, which shines forth in his smallest productions. There is no one but will read with more pleasure those fresh thoughts, those extraordinary imaginings, 1 Pour et contre, No. cxciv."	"those bold and often sublime flights which, though they might startle a strict critic, captivate the heart and stir the imagination. Shakespeare, uninhibited by the rigorous confines of classical forms, ventured into realms of expression and emotion uncharted by the ancients. His works, rich with the vigor of natural genius, present a spectacle of dramatic art that is entirely his own, an art that speaks directly to the soul with all the force of genuine emotion."" Prevost continues to explore this idea, suggesting that the very lack of classical training that might have been deemed a deficit was, in fact, Shakespeare’s greatest asset. ""He was not, it is true, a scholar in the traditional sense, educated in the schools of Greece and Rome, yet this very 'deficiency' allowed him a creative freedom that those bound by stricter scholarly dictates might envy. His ignorance became his strength, giving him the liberty to mold and meld the English language in ways that those who came before him dared not attempt.""

Dr. Galvin is a scholarly regular physician, a graduate of the Harvard Medical School. He is and has been for many years a prominent Boston physician and surgeon. For eighteen years he was surgeon in chief in the Boston Emergency Hospital. Thus, from the point of view of competence, both as to scholastic, medical and surgical knowledge, as a graduate of the leading regular medical college of America, and in experience which covers so long a term of honourable professional activity, Dr. Galvin occupies an enviable eminence in his profession. But what of the man?	Dr. Galvin is not only esteemed for his profound professional abilities but also for his sterling character. His colleagues and patients alike speak of him with a deep respect, not only for his medical expertise but for his compassionate demeanor. He has a reputation for being a patient listener and a thoughtful adviser, qualities that endear him to those under his care. He has always shown a profound commitment to the welfare of his patients, often going beyond the call of duty to ensure their comfort and recovery. His humanitarian efforts extend beyond the operating room. Dr. Galvin is actively involved in community service, regularly participating in free health clinics and educational programs designed to improve public health awareness in underserved areas of Boston. He has also been instrumental in organizing several initiatives aimed at training young physicians, sharing his knowledge and experience to nurture the next generation of healthcare professionals. In personal life, Dr. Galvin is known for his humility and kindness. Despite his achievements and status in the medical community, he remains approachable and grounded. His peers describe him as a man of integrity and principle, someone who has remained true to	1911	1980.4329
"Moneys not yet earned, but expected to be earned in the future under an existing contract, may be assigned, “as can the lien of a mechanic or materialman, ' but the lien must have been perfected ﬁrst. An assignment of claims for work done or materials furnished was held to give no right to the assignee to a lien."" The assignment by a subcontractor of his account for work performed Emery v. Bradford. 29 Cal. 75; Taylor 0. Palmer, 31 Cal. 240 [1886]. ’ 1 Amer. & Eng. Ency. Law 832. 3 Mills 1; . Allen, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 413. [I889]; but see Humphreys 0. Jones, 5 Exch. 952. "" Chambers 0.

Bunk (Neb."	., 15 Neb. 597 [1884]). It is essential to note that the mere assignment of a contractor's account does not by itself create a lien against the property on which the work was performed or the materials were supplied. The right to a lien, as per established legal precedents, must be actively perfected through compliance with statutory requirements, such as timely filing of a notice of lien. Thus, while an assignee may step into the shoes of the assignor concerning the right to payment under the contract, this does not automatically extend to the right to enforce a lien against the property. This distinction is crucial in situations where the property owner or general contractor disputes the claim or when there are competing claims from other creditors or lienholders. The courts have consistently held that the assignment of a claim for payment under a contract does not equate to an assignment of the lien itself unless specific statutory provisions are met. This often involves the filing of specific documents within prescribed time limits and may require the assignee to give notice to the property owner or general contractor. Only when these procedural steps are properly executed	1913	1947.9375
This is cerebrone. It is, as the above account of its preparation shows, a component of the material known formerly as protagone, and the fact that it is obtained from this merely by the discriminating action of certain solvents is one proof among many that protagone is not a single substance. When cerebrone is heated with 10 percent sulphuric acid in methyl alcohol for three hours on the water bath and cooled to 0°, an acid, partly in the form of methyl ester, is found in the precipitate, C^H^O^ to which the name cerebronic acid is given, and from the filtrate the sulphate of a basic substance, sphingosine C19H39NO2, separates on concentration, and from the fluid diluted with water and boiled, galactose is formed out of methyl galactoside. Thudichum's phrenosine gave similar cleavage products, sphing osine, galactose and an acid, neurostearic acid, an isomer of stearic acid.	The discovery of these substances and their breakdown products has significant implications for the understanding of brain chemistry and the molecular structure of neural tissues. Cerebrone, being a complex lipid, is part of the myelin sheath that insulates nerve fibers and is crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system. The breakdown into cerebronic acid, sphingosine, and galactose highlights the intricate biochemical processes occurring within the neural architecture. Sphingosine, a long-chain amino alcohol, is particularly noteworthy as it is a fundamental component of sphingolipids, which are essential constituents of cellular membranes, especially in the nervous system. These molecules are not only structural but also involved in signaling pathways that influence cell growth, differentiation, and death. Thus, the metabolic pathways leading to and from sphingosine are of considerable interest in both basic neuroscience and in the context of various neurological disorders. Cerebronic acid, being a very long-chain fatty acid, is also significant. Its presence in cerebrone suggests a role in maintaining the stability and integrity of myelin.	1913	2007.3992
How she came there I do not know. She was an orphan, living with an aunt who had too many children of her own to pay much attention to the goings and comings of the girl. I suppose she had been picking berries along Snail Road when Man'el trudged past on his lonely errand. I doubt not the man's empty hand, so long accustomed to the clasp of a child's, had opened instinctively to her, and she had taken it quite naturally and followed on. No one can know just what that half hour did to Man'el Costa. While he watched a fragment of everyday drama play itself out on the stage of the two inch lens before his eyes, Lucy, with her child mind, could only understand dimly that something was wrong; she heard the rage within him, but she could not have known what the flame had found to feed upon, which was the valiant spirit of him.	The child, in her innocence, clung tighter to his hand, sensing perhaps the turmoil that churned beneath his stoic exterior. Man'el, in turn, felt a surge of protectiveness over this small, trusting being beside him. It was a poignant reminder of the vulnerabilities and simple trust of childhood, a stark contrast to the complexities and betrayals he had just witnessed through his lens. As they continued down the path, the sun began to dip lower, casting long shadows across their way and painting the world in the soft, forgiving light of dusk. Lucy chattered about the birds they saw, the shapes of clouds, and the adventures she imagined in the woods around them. Her voice, high and clear, cut through the heaviness in Man'el's heart, tethering him back from the dark brink on which he teetered. By the time they reached the end of Snail Road, where the town began to reassert itself with its tidy houses and manicured gardens, Man'el felt a subtle shift within him. The raw edges of his emotions had softened,	1913	2007.795
"The facts upon which an opinion is based must always be laid before the court and jury. This must be done in order that the jury may judge for themselves, and for the further reason that other experts may be called to controvert the opinion It is erroneous to permit a witness to be asked to state his opinion, based on his recollection of the testimony of another witness.' The assumed facts should be stated hypothetically in the question. An expert bridge builder has been properly allowed to give his opinion as to the sufficiency of a timber like unto one that broke in a staging, ’ Some courts have held that such questions should state all the facts, ‘° While others have allowed questions that embrace facts deducible from the evidence, "" and others have permitted questions that assume any facts that ' Union Pac.

In these cases, the courts have emphasized the importance of framing hypothetical questions in a manner that accurately reflects the evidence presented during the trial. This is crucial to ensure that the expert's opinion is relevant and based on a proper understanding of the facts of the case. Furthermore, it has been argued that this approach aids the jury in their evaluation of the expert testimony, as it provides a clear and direct connection between the evidence and the expert's conclusions. In contrast, when hypothetical questions are too broad, or assume facts not in evidence, they can mislead the jury and detract from the fairness of the trial. Therefore, the precision of hypothetical questions is not merely a matter of formality, but a substantive requirement to uphold the integrity of the judicial process. Courts must rigorously scrutinize such questions to ensure that they do not overstep the bounds of the evidence presented, thus preserving the impartiality and effectiveness of expert testimony within the trial framework.	1913	1983.6488
Presently my companion glides on to the subject of British public opinion. That rouses me — in a moment the fighting spirit has me in its grip. I point out that in these days there is no such thing as British public opinion in a national sense; for what with the censor, party politics, and economic conditions, the people who have any opinions do not get much chance of expressing them, whilst most people have little or no opportunity for vitalising the embryo of their inborn sense of appreciation. The only way to gauge public opinion nowadays is through the personal opinions of people who insist on being free to say what they think and feel, and who have or make chances of seeing and knowing what is going on in the world, outside their own four walls and beyond what they read.	"My companion nods thoughtfully, absorbing the weight of my argument, yet he seems poised to counter. ""But surely,"" he begins, tentatively, ""the press and the public forums, even under constraints, still reflect a segment of public sentiment? Even if it's filtered, there's a pulse to be felt."" I shake my head, somewhat exasperated. ""The problem lies exactly there—the pulse you speak of is erratic, manipulated. It's like trying to understand the health of a patient by reading a medical textbook rather than examining the patient directly. The true voice of the people is often drowned out by louder, more powerful voices that have the means to broadcast their opinions as those of the masses."" He concedes the point with a reluctant frown. ""Then, what is to be done? How do we truly hear the people?"" ""Engagement,"" I reply firmly. ""Real, direct engagement. We need forums that are open, unmoderated discussions where people from all walks of life can speak freely. We need to encourage critical thinking and skepticism about mediated information."	1911	2001.0724
Those were our marrying days. 1 had thought that she, of all women, would marry. Children adored her. She managed them with a brusque skill and easy going brightness which amounted to genius. Out came reluctant tongues and hot, diffident hands at her bidding. What children would hers have been! How splendid and how strong and reasonable! And what a mother they would have had!	But fate, it seems, had other designs. She remained unwed, her life taking a turn toward a realm of broader service that seemed to stretch beyond the boundaries of personal ties. Her energies, once imagined as devoted to the nurturing of her own brood, were instead channeled into the care and upliftment of many. She became a figure of maternal grace not to a few, but to a community, perhaps even to the world. Her home, which I had once pictured filled with the laughter and chaos of children, became a sanctuary of solace and encouragement for troubled youths, a place where the needy found a meal and a listening ear. Her influence grew, her name synonymous with benevolence and strength. Yet, in quiet moments when the crowds dispersed and the last of the stragglers had been seen off with a warm embrace or a fortified word, I wondered if she ever felt the pang of that unchosen path. Did she ever pause in the stillness, a sigh trapped between contentment and longing, pondering the life that might have been? Or had	1911	1968.2601
"Then we are told that the word of Jehovah came to the Prophet, commanding him to go forth and stand upon the mountain. ""And, behold, ... a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks""; but Jehovah was not in the wind: ""and after the wind an earthquake""; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake: ""and after the earthquake a fire""; but Jehovah was not in the fire: ""and after the fire a still, small voice."" It is not in externalism, not in the things of which the physical senses take cognizance, that we apprehend God, but in the silence, in the ""still, .small voice"" that speaks to the inner man, the Divine Truth is revealed. In the high and fine lesson found in the rich poetic legends relative to the quest for the Holy Grail, we have again impressed a kindred truth. So long as the sensuous perceptions dominate, the Grail is not discerned. It is not until the illusion of the senses fades away before the lofty aspirations of the tried and purified soul, that the spiritual vision beholds what the eye of sense failed to note, and the eternal Christ truth becomes a vital force in life."	"The Grail, thus, symbolizes not only the quest for divine enlightenment but also the journey of the soul from the clutches of materialism to the embrace of spiritual understanding. In this journey, the distractions of the world—the wind, the earthquake, and the fire—must be transcended. Only then can the seeker hear the ""still, small voice,"" the whisper of divine wisdom that guides the soul towards its true purpose. This profound transition from the external to the internal, from the tumultuous to the tranquil, mirrors the essential transformation that each soul must undergo to attain spiritual maturity. It is a reminder that the divine is found not in the grandiose or the tumultuous events of life, but in quiet introspection and the subtle intuitions of the heart. Just as Elijah found the presence of God not in the dramatic displays of nature but in the gentle whisper that followed, so too must we learn to quiet our minds and listen deeply. The stories of prophets and quests, like those of Elijah and the Holy Grail, serve as metaphors for this inner journey. They"	1911	1955.0084
"Later he makes a voyage to England, and brings back a tender remembrance of this stay, often recalling "" the dear moments passed at Hampton under that beautiful weeping willow whose branches seem to droop down into the Thames, as if to refresh themselves in its fair waters. ""l This journey inspired him with the courage necessary to attempt a translation of Shakespeare in the style of Garrick's 'regularizations': ""It is Romeo and Juliet that I have dared to arrange for a French stage; it appears to have made the greatest impression. I have made considerable changes in the plot, and I have cut out all the comic parts. I am very vain at having won the approbation of some Englishmen, but I should like to have yours."" * Thus the author; but the picture traced by another pen, friendly but malicious, is somewhat different: "" The Chevalier de Chastellux has become a confirmed and determined author. He has brought out two comedies which have been acted all the summer at La Chevrette, a pretty mansion at three leagues from Paris, which belongs to Monsieur de Magnanville, keeper of the royal treasure. Here lately was represented the Chevalier's masterpiece, which is, saving your respect, Romto et Juliette."	"The piece, it must be confessed, was received with more politeness than enthusiasm. The audience, composed mostly of the Chevalier's acquaintances, were charitably disposed, yet the absence of Shakespeare's robust humor and the liberties taken with the tragic sequences left the more discerning amongst them somewhat perplexed. The Chevalier, however, buoyed by the polite applause, seemed unaware of any deficiency, discussing his adaptations with a flourish of intellectual bravado. ""Indeed,"" he would declare, ""the English bard's work, though a jewel, was unpolished for the French taste. It required a certain... refinement, a softening of the more vulgar jests, to suit the sensibilities of our Parisian audiences."" Yet, despite his confidence, whispers circulated that the translation lacked the visceral impact of the original, its poetry diminished by the Chevalier's well-meaning but heavy hand. Critics, few in number but sharp in tongue, suggested that the adaptation strayed too far from the raw heart of Shakespeare's tale, transforming poignant tragedy into mere melodrama.

The church was dedicated on January 5, 1895, and so rapidly did the congregation grow under the wise new arrangement that within eight years it was found too small to meet the requirements of the membership, though the same service was held twice each Sunday. Mrs. Eddy, who on the completion of the church had been elected pastor emeritus, in 1902 suggested the pressing need of a larger edifice, and at the 'annual meeting of the church it was voted to raise any part of two million dollars necessary to supply the congregation with a church building that would meet its needs. In June, 1906, the splendid new temple,  62 costing two million dollars and seating over five thousand persons, was dedicated. It was built in the rear of the Mother Church and is one of the most impressive religious structures in the New World.	The architectural design of the new temple combines both traditional and innovative elements, creating a harmonious blend of the old and the new. Its towering spire and expansive stained glass windows evoke a sense of awe and reverence, drawing in all who gaze upon it. The interior is equally magnificent, with high vaulted ceilings, intricate carvings, and an altar that stands as a focal point of spiritual contemplation. The dedication ceremony itself was a grand event attended by thousands from across the country and even from overseas, all eager to witness the unveiling of this monumental achievement. The service was led by prominent figures of the church, and Mrs. Eddy herself, although not present, sent a message that was read aloud, expressing her joy and approval of the new temple which she believed would serve as a beacon of light and hope for many generations to come. Following the dedication, the church continued to thrive and expand its outreach. Various community programs were initiated, including educational workshops, charity drives, and public lectures on spiritual healing, all of which were supported by the congregation's robust growth. The temple not only	1911	1953.2897
sixty-three balloons were sent up on 22 days. Of these 41 were followed by two theodolites and the remainder by one only. The maximum heights above the ground to which the observations were carried are shown in the following table : — Height < 0 5 0-5-1-0 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 5-6 km. Number of ascents 13 18 17 6 3 3 3 In the majority of the ascents the balloons were lost to sight either in or behind clouds. The gradient wind at the times of the ascents ranged up to 33 metres per second. The wind direction fell in almost all cases in either the SOUTHWEST. or NORTHWEST.	The data collected during these ascents provides crucial insights into atmospheric conditions at varying altitudes. Such information is essential for refining weather prediction models and understanding air current behaviors, especially considering the high speeds of the gradient wind noted. The frequent loss of the balloons in or behind clouds also highlights challenges in tracking and data collection, which could potentially be mitigated by advancements in tracking technology or the use of more visible or radar-responsive balloons. Continued study in this area could include deploying balloons with enhanced tracking capabilities or scheduling launches during periods of clearer skies to decrease the likelihood of losing sight of them. Additionally, simultaneous multi-theodolite tracking across all ascents could ensure more comprehensive data collection, allowing for a more detailed analysis of wind patterns and behaviors at these higher altitudes. This would not only improve the accuracy of local weather forecasts but could also contribute to broader meteorological studies on wind dynamics and cloud formation.	1912	2005.4081
They were coming on at a speed which seemed to be about 17 knots, and were formed in line ahead, in a line perfectly maintained, so that, as they were approaching on almost exactly the opposite course, their number could not be counted. In another minute or two, as the distance between the two squadrons rapidly diminished, it was clear from her curious girdermasts that the ship at the head of the line was either the large German armoured cruiser W alder see, the first of the large type built by Germany, or some other ship of her class. At six miles distance several squadrons of destroyers were made out, also formed in line ahead, and steaming alongside the German line, abaft either beam. A battle was imminent ; there was no time to issue elaborate orders, or make fresh dispositions. The British Admiral signalled that he would turn to starboard, to reconnoitre the strange fleet, and reserve fire till closer quarters. He turned five points, which altered his course to an east south easterly one.	As the fleets converged, tension mounted among the crew, each man at his post, eyes fixed on the looming silhouettes of the German ships. The grey North Sea swelled beneath them, a vast arena for the impending clash. The air was thick with the smell of oil and anticipation. The German fleet, maintaining their perfect line, advanced with mechanical precision, their destroyers flanking them like wolves ready to pounce. The heavy clouds overhead seemed to press down upon the ships, adding a somber weight to the atmosphere. The British fleet responded with equal discipline, the ships aligning as they executed the ordered turn. The Admiral, from his position on the bridge, surveyed the scene through his binoculars, his face set in grim determination. The signal flags fluttered as another message was sent aloft, instructing the gunners to prepare for action but hold their fire until the command was given. Silence reigned over the British ships as they steamed forward, the only sounds the creaking of the hulls and the low hum of the engines. The men knew	1906	1970.6511
"The force on the model tends to produce rotation about the vertical arm and can be measured as a moment. No correction has here to be applied, since the horizontal arm is symmetrical about the axis of rotation. The following series of experiments were carried out, and numerical results and curves are given in the paper. Measurements of the ""lift"" of a cylinder, terminated by spherical ends. — This model was 372 mm. long and 65 mm. in diameter. The value of the force at each angle is given as the mean of four measurements, uui and return runs of the carriage being taken for each of two symmetrical settings: this eliminates errors of setting. The elliptical plate above referred to was not used, which,   349 perhaps, accounts for some irregularity in the results."	The experiment was conducted in a wind tunnel with a steady airflow, where the model was mounted on a balance capable of measuring both lift and drag forces. The airflow speed was kept constant throughout the series of tests to ensure consistency in the measurements. The angles of attack tested ranged from -10 degrees to +10 degrees, at increments of 2 degrees. Graphs plotted from the collected data showed a typical lift curve, with the lift coefficient increasing linearly with the angle of attack up to a certain point before tapering off and eventually decreasing, indicating stall. The stall angle was observed around +8 degrees, beyond which the lift coefficients began to decline sharply. Additionally, drag coefficients were calculated, showing an expected increase as the angle of attack increased. This was due to the larger surface area being exposed to the airflow, thus increasing the aerodynamic resistance. The spherical ends of the cylinder seemed to influence the flow separation, delaying the stall to a higher angle compared to a similar cylinder with flat ends. This observation aligns with theoretical predictions about the aerodynamic benefits of using spherical or rounded terminations in cylindrical	1912	1987.1053
We want every class represented. We want every creed represented. We want represented there the men of learning and letters, the men of commerce, the men of the professions, the workingmen, the tradesmen, the farmers, the labourers and artisans — the Catholic, the Protestant, and the Presbyterian (loud cheers). We want equal justice and toleration for all honest opinions, and even, I would say, for all honest idiosyncrasies. Yes, we want equality, and I say — speaking, as I believe I can speak, for the mass of the Nationalists and Catholics of Ireland — we won't have, and we won't tolerate, an ascendancy of any class or creed (loud cheers).	We are gathered here, not just as representatives of our individual selves or our immediate communities, but as heralds of a broader, more inclusive future. It is a future where the barriers of class, of creed, and of occupation are broken down, where mutual respect and equal opportunity are not merely ideals, but realities lived daily by every man, woman, and child. We stand on the precipice of change, a change that calls for unity and an unwavering commitment to the common good. It is a call to set aside the divisions that have long hindered our progress, to reject the prejudices that have fueled discord, and to embrace a spirit of cooperation that will propel us forward. Let it be known that in this new era, no one will be left behind. No voice will be silenced. Here, in this assembly, every man has a stake, every woman has a role, and every child will inherit the promise of this great endeavor. We will build not just for today, but for tomorrow, ensuring that the foundations we lay now will support generations to come. Together, let	1911	1937.399
M'sai Uganda next appeared, and, having without avail attempted to push his women into the background, began to dicker as to a special price for their admission. But Bellinger was firm; he knew the Watawasha men were gorged with gold from the last time they had sold cattle on the Masai ranges, and he meant to take his tithe or fight. He stood behind his table and threw Balli los's entrance dollars one by one, with much noise, into the tin cases, secretly noting M'sai's finery and that of his women, one of whom wore a necklace of half burned candles tied together with a man's depleted garter of grimy pink. His own costume was helped out by  687 brass paper clips which clamped his unkempt wool here and there, and which Bellinger had himself given him without a thought of their possible decorative value.	"M'sai, seemingly oblivious to the scrutiny, continued to haggle, his voice rising sharply over the clink of coins. ""Surely, Bellinger, a man of your understanding can see the justice in my request. These women are not mere cattle to be taxed without consideration. They deserve a fairer rate."" Bellinger, however, was unmoved. His gaze was steely as he responded, ""Justice, M'sai? When has the Watawasha ever shown justice in their trades? You come here, your pockets heavy from your dealings, yet you plead poverty when it's time to give."" The crowd around them began to murmur, their interest piqued by the growing tension. M'sai’s face darkened, his pride stung by the public challenge. ""We are not cheats, Bellinger. We have always paid our dues. Today should be no different."" Bellinger leaned forward, his hands firmly planted on the table. ""Then pay the full price, M'sai. No discounts. That is my final word.""

of its cost, and that ﬁnal settlement should be made on their certificate, it was held that, as the last act required of the architect was to give a ﬁnal certificate, his time for ﬁling a lien for services did not begin to run until the performance of such acth The argument that by the constitution “all men are born free and independent, and have certain indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness, ” does not seem to have had much weight in an attack against lien laws which protect only a certain class of em ployees.“ IAmazon Irri ating Co. 11.

It is clear then that the principles governing the application of lien laws are complex and require careful navigation. The courts often have to balance the constitutional rights of individuals with statutory provisions intended to protect specific interests or classes. In the case of architects, for instance, their right to file a lien for unpaid services is recognized only upon the completion of certain contractual obligations, such as the issuance of a final certificate. This underscores the importance of the contractual framework within which services are rendered and the completion of all stipulated actions before certain legal remedies can be pursued. Moreover, the selective protection offered by lien laws, which typically cover only specific categories of workers or professionals, continues to raise questions about equality and fairness in their application. The constitutional argument that all men have the right to protect their property and pursue happiness is a compelling one, yet the practical enforcement of lien laws often necessitates a more narrow interpretation. This can lead to disparities in legal protection and redress available to different groups, which is a significant concern in the broader context of justice and equity in contractual and employment relationships.

As shown by tension tests of separate wires and whole ropes, the rope does not develop the full strength of all the wires. This probably arises mainly from the fact that in the rope some wires are initially lighter than others, and consequently take an undue proportion of the load. For tensile tests of wire ropes it is important to grip the ends without damaging them, or fracture will occur at the socket. A very satisfactory method, recommended by Prof. Goodman, is shown in Fig. 244. The rope is tightly bound with fine wire about 5 inches from each end, and the length of rope between these bindings is tightly bound with tarred band to keep the strands in position; the ends are then frayed out, cleaned, and the wires turned over into hooks at the ends. A hard alloy of lead and antimony is then cast on the ends in the form of conical caps, which are received in split conical dies in the shackles of the testing machine. The conical dies may conveniently be used as moulds for casting on the metal caps. Fig.	245 illustrates this arrangement, with the rope secured in the testing machine ready for the tension test. The hard alloy ensures a firm grip without compressing or cutting into the wire, allowing for an even distribution of the load across all strands and wires within the rope. This method has proven to reduce the likelihood of premature failure at the grip points, which is a common issue in less carefully prepared test setups. During the actual test, it is critical to monitor the elongation of the rope as well as the load applied. The elongation can provide valuable insights into the ductility and the ultimate tensile strength of the wire rope. Commonly, the total elongation is recorded at the maximum load point, just before the rope fails. This data, along with the load at which the rope fails, will help in determining the actual tensile strength of the rope, taking into account the inefficiencies caused by the uneven load distribution among the wires. To further ensure accuracy, it is advisable to conduct multiple tests on ropes from the same batch to account for material variability. Statistical analysis of the results can then be	1908	1995.3906
The courts have held that the government guarantees every man the protection of the courts and their assistance, and that no man can enter into a contract that shall deny him this privilege and right. A contract of employment between a company using patented machines and a mechanical engineer which requires that any improvements in the machines made by such engineer shall belong to the company is not unreasonable nor contrary to public policy.‘ * XSee Ins.

Such agreements are generally upheld especially in industries where innovation and development are rapid and ongoing, and where the employer has a legitimate interest in retaining rights to inventions made by employees during employment, using the employer's resources. Furthermore, courts have consistently recognized that while every individual has the right to seek judicial redress, they may also have contractual obligations that must be honored unless they are explicitly contrary to law or public policy. In the case of standard employment contracts involving intellectual property, such as the scenario described, the courts generally find that the agreements serve a legitimate business purpose and do not unduly restrict the engineer’s civil liberties or opportunities for employment elsewhere. As such, these contracts are typically seen as a fair exchange of value—protection and compensation from the	1913	1947.2177
His sharp grey eyes could be very cold, though they were sometimes gentle. He wore a short fringe of white beard from ear to ear, and his domed head was only partly covered with iron grey hair. Square and powerful of build and now grown somewhat portly, he appeared a strong man and not altogether an unkindly one. As he sat there, frowning slightly in his absorption, so near the ground upon which his well built brick farmhouse stood with an air of assurance and possession, he looked very closely akin to the solid earth, the solid house, and the brown fields which he dominated. The girl Millie made a sudden rush from the house, as a playful kitten does, and curled herself beside her father on the steps with something of a kitten's flippant confidence. Her mother came out more slowly, knitting in hand, and took the rocking chair behind them. Katrina Schwarz was an ample, large framed, motherly woman, deep bosomed and broad shouldered.	"Her face, marked by the lines of many cares and kindnesses, wore a habitual expression of serene patience. Her hands moved deftly, the needles clicking softly as the yarn slipped through her fingers, forming the fabric stitch by stitch. The evening air was cool and carried the scent of freshly turned soil and blooming wildflowers from the nearby fields. As she rocked gently, the rhythmic motion seemed to harmonize with the tranquil scene, a perfect counterpoint to her husband's more stolid presence. Jacob, the father, glanced at his daughter with a half-smile, his stern features softening momentarily. ""Millie, you're as restless as the wind today,"" he commented, his voice a mixture of admonishment and affection. ""Can't you sit still for a moment?"" Millie laughed, a clear, ringing sound that seemed to momentarily lift the weight of the day's labor from Jacob's shoulders. ""Oh, Papa, the day is too beautiful to sit still! The sky is too blue, and my legs ache to run!"" Her mother looked up from her knitting"	1913	1966.2642
As an example, assume a spread of 22F for surface parcels of air. If these parcels ascend as part of a convection preliminary to the occurrence of a Cumulus or to add to a Cumulus already present, they will reach saturation at a level given by the fraction 22/4.6, which is approximately 4800 feet. This then will be the base of the cloud. Given a surface spread of 50F, the base of any Cumulus originating in con TABLE 6.

It allows for 220 feet for each degree of spread.	As the spread increases, so too does the cloud base, reflecting the greater altitude required for the air parcel to cool to its dew point and condense into a cloud. This relationship is critical in meteorology for predicting the formation of clouds and the potential for precipitation. The table provided offers a straightforward way to estimate cloud bases given a specific temperature spread, which can be invaluable for weather forecasting and aviation planning. For instance, if the spread were to increase to 65F, using the same rate of 4.55F/1000 feet, the cloud base would be calculated as follows: 65F spread / 4.55F/1000 feet = 14285.71 feet. Rounding this to the nearest 20 feet for consistency with the table, the estimated cloud base would be approximately 14280 feet. This method provides a quick estimation tool that can help in various practical applications, from aviation to outdoor event planning, ensuring safety and preparedness in weather-dependent situations.	1913	2004.0406
"Now, in reviewing the general situation of the summer of 1643, what you get is this : the west has been upon the whole thoroughly recaptured for the King and the western army has effected its junction with the Oxford command, but to this apparently complete success there are two very important modifications. First, of the total forces levied in the west many had refused to proceed to the Midlands and to abandon the neighbourhood of their homes — the junction with the Oxford command, therefore, though strategically   NOTE  March of Parliament to Relief of Gloucester in . '643 March offlarfiament  to Siege of York Marston Moor iatS44 """"""""  Lancashire  Attempts at Convergence on Oxford  rote Royalists FraarWest 2 ' North   effected, did not mean, as it should have meant, a large numerical increase. Secondly, one important garrison still held out for the Parliament — the garrison of Gloucester. Meanwhile, the northern successes are not complete, and though communications are open between Gloucester and the north by way of Newark, they are badly threatened on their eastern flank, and there is no true occupation of the belt of country between the Midlands and the Yorkshire plain."	This precarious situation creates a significant strategic dilemma for both sides. As the Royalist forces aim to consolidate their gains, their inability to fully mobilize the western levies underscores a chronic issue of regional loyalty and logistical challenges. The Parliamentarian garrison at Gloucester serves not merely as a military thorn but as a symbol of ongoing resistance, emboldening further Parliamentary support in the region and complicating the Royalist efforts to dominate the Midlands.  Furthermore, the incomplete victories in the north, while momentarily advantageous in keeping certain communication lines open, expose vulnerabilities. The Royalists must guard against potential incursions and uprisings that could sever these critical links. Moreover, without a solid grip on the territory stretching from the Midlands to Yorkshire, the Royalists are unable to launch a unified and concentrated attack, thereby giving Parliament much-needed breathing room and an opportunity to regroup and reinforce their positions. In response to these challenges, both strategists and commanders on the ground would need to adapt their tactics. For the Royalists, securing more robust local support and improving logistical operations could be key in leveraging their	1912	1991.518
"That is something new to me, Professor, "" exclaimed M'Allister ; "" and I cannot say I quite understand how refraction, as you term it, has the effect you mention."" "" It may help you, then, "" I answered, "" if I tell you that water acts very much in the same way ; and there is a simple and fairly well-known experiment you might try for yourself, which would make the matter perfectly clear to you. It is as follows: — "" Take a teacup and place a shilling at the bottom of it, then move back until you quite lose sight of the coin. Ask some one to pour some clean cold water gently into the cup, and, as it fills, the refraction of the water will apparently reduce the depth of the cup, and thus bring the coin fully into view. In much the same way the refraction of the atmosphere enables us to see the sun or the moon when those bodies are actually below the horizon."""	"M'Allister nodded thoughtfully, absorbing the explanation with a keen interest. ""I see,"" he said slowly, ""so the light rays are bent as they pass through different mediums, be it water or the atmosphere, and this bending—this refraction—changes how we perceive the position of objects."" ""Exactly,"" I continued, ""and this phenomenon isn't limited to just celestial bodies. It affects everything we see to some extent. For instance, a stick partially submerged in water appears bent at the point of entry. That's also due to refraction."" He seemed intrigued and leaned forward. ""So this bending of light, can it be calculated or predicted?"" ""Certainly,"" I replied. ""The degree of refraction can be quantified using Snell's Law, which relates the angle of incidence with the angle of refraction. By knowing the indices of refraction of the media involved—air, water, glass, and so on—you can predict exactly how light will behave as it transitions from one medium to another.""

the latter are fast encroaching upon this delightful but somewhat neglected spot, and unless the Croy donians are wise enough to secure the acquirement of the summit of the hill as a public open space, this splendid view will be entirely lost to future generations. A further advantage of our situation was its nearness to Croydon and Wallington, where there were engineering and electrical machinery works ; besides which we also had convenient and easy means of reaching the metropolis, from whence we could travel to any other town to purchase or order anything we might require. Once we had fairly set to work our progress was rapid and our vessel had practically been complete nearly a year, since when we have undertaken many voyages at night in order to test its powers and to ascertain where improvements were needed.	The quietude of the night hours was most favorable for our experiments, allowing us to manipulate the mechanisms and observe their responses without the usual daytime interruptions. The crisp air seemed to invigorate the machinery, almost as if it too thrived under the cover of darkness. Our nocturnal endeavors were not without challenges, however. On several occasions, we faced minor mechanical failures that required immediate attention, testing our resolve and our technical prowess. Yet, each mishap served as a valuable lesson, revealing weaknesses that might have remained hidden under less demanding conditions. The serene solitude of these night voyages also provided a unique opportunity for introspection and team bonding. As we navigated through the darkness, guided only by the faint glow of our instruments and the occasional distant light, we learned to rely not just on our skills, but on each other. Trust was built not out of convenience but necessity, a camaraderie forged in the quiet moments between the creaking of gears and the soft hum of the engine. As dawn approached on these nights, the first hints of light would mingle with the artificial glow	1911	1969.0132
With the date of this battle, the 4th of August, 1265, ends the third phase of the war. THE FIRST PHASE (June to December, 1263). The first phase of the war is of little interest in the study of military topography. It is confused and ends indecisively. Such as it is it may be briefly told.	The initial stage was marked by a series of skirmishes and minor engagements, primarily centered around the control of key fortresses and passes. Both parties sought to secure strategic positions that would allow them to command the surrounding territories and main lines of communication. The lack of decisive operations was largely due to the scattered nature of forces and the rugged terrain, which made coordinated movements difficult and often resulted in isolated clashes rather than organized campaigns. The most significant of these early encounters was the Battle of Lewes, where Simon de Montfort's forces achieved a surprising victory over King Henry III. This victory, however, did not translate into a clear strategic advantage, as Montfort was unable to capitalize fully on his position due to logistical challenges and internal dissent within his ranks. The countryside, divided in loyalty, provided a patchwork of support and resistance, which further complicated the campaign efforts. As winter approached, the operations slowed considerably. The inclement weather and the difficulties in maintaining supply lines in the cold season forced both sides to halt major movements, leading to a temporary and uneasy stalemate. This period allowed both factions to	1912	1956.6327
"The season was, there 260  fore, midsummer, and as Sirapion is in latitude 25° south and in the sub tropical zone, the temperature was fairly high. The mornings were much more clear and brilliant than those on our earth ; the warmth and general "" feel "" of the air at that time reminding me very much of what it is like in the south of England between seven and eight o'clock on a hot sunny day. Those who enjoy an early morning walk know how delightful and exhilarating it becomes towards that time. There is neither chilliness nor uncomfortable heat ; one feels a delightful sense of freedom and that it is good to be alive. This is really the best and most enjoyable time on a summer's day. On Mars there was rather more warmth but a greater sense of exhilaration."	The sun, though farther away than from our own planet, shone with a peculiar intensity that seemed to imbue everything with a more vivid life. The light had a golden quality, casting long, soft shadows and highlighting the reds and oranges of the Martian landscape. The air was thin but crisp, lacking the heavy humidity of Earth's atmospheres, which made each breath feel invigorating. As I walked across the rust-colored plains, the ground beneath my feet crunched slightly, a reminder of the alien soil's unique composition. The horizon stretched endlessly, a vast expanse that beckoned with the mystery of the unknown. The distant mountains, their peaks dusted with frost despite the warmth, stood as silent sentinels over the desolate beauty. Flora on Sirapion, though sparse, added bursts of color to the predominantly ochre terrain. Small, hardy plants, adapted to the harsh conditions, bloomed with brilliant effervescence. Their resilience was a testament to life's persistence, even in the most unlikely places. The sense of solitude was profound, yet	1911	2001.191
The two bridge arms, which are in parallel with the lamp and its corresponding arm, have approximately five times the resistance of the latter, so that the amount of additional current which they require produces no undue drain on the battery. The telephone receiver is provided with a head band, so that both hands are left free for the operation of rotating the contact wheel and adjusting the external rheostat until a condition of silence in the  10 telephone is attained. The adjustment of current in this way can be made within about one milliampere, which is substantially the limit of accuracy of reading of a high grade instrument. Therefore the measurement involves, in the shape of apparatus external to the photometer, only the telephone receiver, which can be readily carried in the pocket if desired.	The simplicity of this setup allows for quick and efficient assessments of light intensity, making it an invaluable tool for technicians and researchers alike. The portability of the telephone receiver, coupled with the minimal requirement for external equipment, ensures that field measurements can be conducted with ease. In practical applications, this method proves to be especially useful in environments where traditional photometric devices might be cumbersome or impractical to use. Furthermore, the precision of the measurement, thanks to the fine control over the current provided by the external rheostat, allows for highly accurate data collection. This precision is crucial in fields such as optical research, where even minor discrepancies can lead to significant errors in the interpretation of results. The ability to achieve such accuracy without the need for bulky or expensive equipment democratizes the process, making sophisticated measurements accessible to a broader range of users and applications. In addition to its practical benefits, this method also offers theoretical insights into the behavior of electrical circuits under different lighting conditions. By analyzing the changes in resistance and current flow within the circuit, researchers can glean valuable information about the properties of the materials involved and the	1912	1998.8717
The further discussion of the action of such an arrangement is given below. 380 Steering in the vertical plane (Chapter 4). — A f nil discussion is now given of the motion in the vertical plane of an airship fitted with an automatic horizontal rudder. It is remarked that the theory of the equivalence of an automatic rudder to a fixed tail previously considered could be extended also to its action as a control, so that it might be supposed to be replaced by a virtual rudder of determinate area; but, in view of certain small points which arise, there are advantages in a more direct discussion of the whole question. This discussion will involve an examination into the stability of the motion ; but it is convenient first to deal with the static problem. The function of the elevators is twofold: (1) to give an increased lift, or balance a loss of weight ; (2) to cause the ship to ascend or descend. These two.	functions are closely interrelated, as the adjustment of the elevators to alter the pitch angle of the airship directly affects its lift and descent characteristics. The static problem involves the equilibrium position of the airship when the elevators are set at a certain angle. This angle determines the pitch of the airship, which in turn influences the lift generated by the envelope and the distribution of aerodynamic forces along the hull. In practical terms, the angle of the elevators must be finely tuned to maintain the desired altitude and attitude of the airship under various conditions of load and atmospheric pressure. This tuning is critical because even minor deviations can result in significant changes in trajectory. The dynamic aspect of elevator control comes into play when the airship needs to change altitude, either ascending or descending. This maneuver involves a temporary disturbance of the static equilibrium, requiring careful modulation of the elevator angles to achieve a controlled change in pitch and lift. The stability of this motion is paramount, as any oscillatory or erratic movements can compromise the safety and efficiency of the airship. Stability analysis typically examines the response of the airship	1912	1972.9241
One of the most wonderful transformations which he effects is in the character of the painted lady. She seeks at first to coquet and flirt with him in her silly way, till, taking a seat in front of her, he causes her to see herself as nature meant her to be; not ugly, vain and unattractive as she thought her mirror always revealed her, but sedately beautiful, calm and gracious. Instead of a coquettish woman with titian dyed wig, pencilled brows, rouged cheeks and painted lips, she is transformed into a middle-aged, grey haired lady, of reserved and distant manner, the embodiment of noble quality and unconscious grace. Thus is every character almost instantly transformed from meanness, hypocrisy, cant, viciousness and indecency, to honour, dignity, virtue and ennoblement. When at length the time arrives for the Stranger to make his departure, little slavey, like Mary Magdalen at the grave of the Christ, is the last to mourn, watching with tearful eye his tall form slowly disappear.	The transformation wrought by the Stranger leaves a profound impact on the community. The painted lady, now embracing her true self, begins to shed the superficial layers that once defined her. Her interactions with others become more genuine and heartfelt, and she finds a new respect within the community that had previously dismissed her as frivolous. Others touched by the Stranger's influence undergo similar metamorphoses, casting aside their deceitful and harmful ways in favor of a life led with integrity and sincerity. The local vicar, once a man of empty sermons and hidden vices, finds himself reinvigorated with a genuine faith that had eluded him for years. His renewed zeal and authentic compassion resonate with his congregation, bringing a revival of spirituality that transforms the church into a true place of refuge and community. Even the town's gruff old miser, known for his penny-pinching and harsh demeanor, discovers a newfound generosity and kindness. He starts to contribute to the welfare of the town, aiding those in need and investing in communal projects that had been long neglected. As the Stranger's presence fades into a memory	1911	1976.6075
Mr. Rawlings, in his paper, has almost entirely ignored all considerations of efficiency. The lighting fixtures illustrated on the slides which he exhibited were fitted with dense shades which must have been absorbing anything from 20 to 50 percent of the horizontal candle power, and the efficiency therefore on the plane of illumination must have been very poor indeed. For instance, six 100 c. p. lamps for lighting ground for Mr. Webber's complaint on that score. MB. JUSTUS ECK (communicated). — Having had much experience in private house lighting. I fully realise the personal difficulties of dealing with the user of artificial light in what he feels is his impregnable castle; but, after all, the private citizen is under the influence of the sanitary as well as other laws in his home, and has to comply with the regulations of the gas, water, telephone, and electric authorities, and generally agrees with these.	Therefore, it is not unreasonable to suggest that more stringent regulations concerning the efficiency of lighting should also be enforced. The excessive use of dense, ornate shades that absorb a significant amount of light not only wastes energy but also fails to provide adequate illumination where it is most needed. This leads to higher electricity consumption as people tend to install more lighting fixtures or use bulbs with higher wattage to compensate for the loss in effective lighting, thus exacerbating the problem. Furthermore, in my observations, many households are not aware of the potential savings in cost and energy that could be achieved by simply opting for more efficient lighting solutions. Education on this topic should be an integral part of the services provided by electric authorities. Offering workshops or informational pamphlets on efficient lighting practices could greatly assist in this endeavor. It is essential that we move towards a standard where lighting efficiency is not just recommended but required, much like the standards set for appliances and building insulation. This not only aids in reducing overall energy consumption but also helps in mitigating the environmental impact associated with excessive energy use. It is high time that lighting efficiency is given	1912	1999.5942
"Thus it was that the Master led the way to an ineffable kingdom — saying "" It is within you."" His was no esoterical philosophy, but the disclosure of an open secret, of the wonder eternally familiar. In the realm of creative life everything is wonderful, nothing strange or novel; but it is all inexplicable, and does not need to be explained. Yet it seems to await discovery, because we become so entangled, bewildered, and distracted in the field of actuality and illusion. To our sense perception the world is veiled, a broken world, contracted not only by the limitations but by the very object and use of perception in direct relation to action."	In this tangled web, we often lose sight of the essence, the underlying unity that pervades all creation. The Master's teaching gently untangles us, guiding our gaze inward to the constancy and serenity of the inner kingdom. It is here, in this inner sanctuary, that the eternal truths reside, unmarred by the transient illusions of the external world.  The Master reminds us that this kingdom is not a distant or foreign land to be reached through arduous journeys or esoteric rituals. Rather, it is always present, quietly residing within each of us, awaiting our recognition and acceptance. It is a place where the soul recognizes its reflection in the divine, where the boundaries of self dissolve into the universal. This realization is both the simplest and the most profound of understandings, accessible to anyone who turns their attention inward and quiets the clamor of the mundane world. Here, in the stillness, the soul finds its truest expression, its deepest peace, and its most enduring happiness. The path to this kingdom is paved with mindfulness, compassion, and the steady relinqu	1913	1960.5297
"The second lesson would treat the idea of an array with more precision, by showing schemes of distribution and centesimal graduation of the base. The third lesson would proceed from variates to deviates and show the genesis of the theoretical normal curve and the use of the quartile. The fourth lesson would show the different forms of the curve of normal distribution, and the meaning of the curve of frequency, and its unit of variability, the standard deviation. The last lesson would deal with the measurement of correlation and the determination of the index of correlation. The last section of the lecture is concerned with the influence of collective opinion upon individual conduct. The individual is shown to be largely at the mercy of a series of customs, prejudices and other influences. Illustrations are given of how this body of controlling sentiment has changed in the past, and the probability is indicated that when Eugenics is sufficiently established on its basis of evidence it will alter the attitude of man toward matters affecting the quality of the race. Tn connexion with Mr. Galton's attempt to make available for nonmathematical students the more simple of the statistical methods used in Eugenic investigation, should be mentioned a book not yet well-known in this country, Professor Thorndike's "" Theory of Mental and Social Measurements."""	This book, while technical in nature, is designed to bring the principles of statistical analysis within the reach of those engaged in educational and social studies, who might not otherwise have the mathematical background required for such endeavors. It emphasizes the practical application of statistical methods to the problems of psychology and sociology, providing readers with the tools necessary to apply these techniques to their own research questions. In the broader context of Eugenics, understanding these statistical methods is crucial. It enables researchers and policymakers to interpret data accurately, thus making informed decisions that could have profound implications on societal health and genetic policies. Professor Thorndike's work, therefore, serves as a bridge between complex statistical theories and their application in real-world scenarios, emphasizing the necessity of rigorous analysis in the formulation of effective and ethical eugenic policies. Furthermore, the book discusses the importance of measurement accuracy and the potential pitfalls in psychological and social testing—issues that are paramount when considering the implications of eugenics. It provides a nuanced view on the reliability of various measurements and offers strategies to enhance the validity of research findings. As eugenics continues to	1908	2004.9304
The mulch may consist of straw litter, coal ashes, hard wood sawdust, or similar material. If ashes or sawdust is used it should not be mixed with the soil but kept on the surface. It is often a good plan to mulch near the plants and cultivate in the centre of the rows. Ashes or sawdust used for this purpose will keep down the weeds near the plants and do away with the necessity of hand cultivating. Pine sawdust is not as good for this purpose as that from the hard woods, but may be safely used if kept on the surface of the land and not mixed with it. Partially rotted sawdust is much to be preferred to that which is fresh. Pruning. The currant is improved by some pruning each year.	This should be done while the bushes are dormant, typically in late winter before new growth begins. The goal of pruning currants is to remove old wood, which is less productive, and to encourage the growth of new, more fruitful branches. It is advisable to remove about a third of the oldest branches each year, cutting them back to the ground. This helps to keep the bush rejuvenated and open to light and air, which reduces the risk of disease. Additionally, any branches that are broken, diseased, or crossing each other should be removed to maintain the health and structure of the bush. After pruning, the remaining branches should be spaced well enough to allow light to penetrate and air to circulate throughout the bush, which helps in promoting a healthy growth and a good crop. It is also beneficial to trim the tips of excessively long branches to encourage branching, which can lead to more fruit production. After pruning, a light application of fertilizer can be beneficial to support new growth, but care should be taken not to over-fertilize as this can lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of	1914	1950.6798
In the simple structure of the lower jaw, hnt. Miu. that. Cryptodelma orientalis. like the other members of the family, it shows a closer resemblance to the snakes than does the European Slow worm. It is of course perfectly harmless, and it can be easily recognised by its keeled scales, which give it a rough unsuakelike look, even if the stumps of the hind legs cannot be seen. It is remarkable for its brittleness. If the tail be seized, the part held is left at once in the captor's hand, while the rest of the animal wriggles up quickly to shelter. An individual seized by the head and placed in a box or bag will very likely be found to have voluntarily snapped its long tail into three or four pieces. As with the Geckoes, a lost tail is easily replaced by another growing in its place, but the reproduced tail is always shorter and differs in the scaling and colouring. THE COMMON SLOW worm 217   218 The black headed Slow worm. Cryptodelma niyriceps. Of this species only a single young one has been recorded. It was about five inches long, flesh coloured above, with the head black. It came from Nicol Bay in West Australia. The Eastern Slow worm.	Cryptodelma orientale, primarily inhabits the dense underbrush and leaf litter of Southeast Asian forests. It thrives in these humid, shaded environments, often hidden beneath fallen leaves or within the crevices of decaying logs. Its ability to blend into the forest floor is enhanced by its earthy coloration, which ranges from a dull brown to a subtle green, mimicking the hues of the natural surroundings. This species, like its relatives, is nocturnal, emerging from its hiding spots at dusk to hunt for small invertebrates such as insects, spiders, and occasionally small amphibians. Its diet is crucial not only for its survival but also for controlling the population of these smaller creatures, thereby maintaining a balanced ecosystem. The Eastern Slow worm is also known for its unique defensive mechanism. Upon feeling threatened, it can perform autotomy, a process where it deliberately severs its tail to distract predators, giving it a chance to escape. This trait, while effective, is a costly escape strategy, as regenerating its tail requires significant energy and resources. In terms of reproduction, Cryptodel	1909	2006.7081
It was impossible to get him to do so. He turned bad tempered, and was so sulky that we had the gloomiest dinner party I ever was at in my life. I had all the less reason for expecting so absolute a refusal from the fact that I had shown him much politeness in advance, a thing of which I repent; I had paid him two visits for one with which that histrion had deigned to honour me; I had made him a present of my printed pieces ; he had desired to hear my comedy, La Vtrite dans le Tin, and I had had the kindness to go and read it to him. I had promised to read him Henri IV., for which he had asked me too. On the day when I was fool enough to receive him I gave all my 14  attention to him and his wife, and did my best to bore myself with talking to them of nothing but their England, and of whatever might interest those two donkeys.	Yet, for all my efforts, he remained obstinately distant, scarcely responding and showing no inclination to engage in any meaningful conversation. As the evening wore on, his demeanor grew only more frosty, casting a chill over the gathering that no amount of lively chatter or warm smiles from other guests could dispel. It was as though a cloud had settled directly above our table, and all my attempts to dispel it were met with the cold, unyielding resistance of his indifference.  His wife, too, seemed caught in the same sullen mood, her replies short and her smiles forced, contributing further to the stilted atmosphere. I couldn't fathom what had soured him so thoroughly against me or the evening I had so carefully planned. Had I inadvertently offended him? Or was there some deeper, unspoken grievance that he harbored against me? The questions circled in my mind as I tried to navigate the evening with a facade of composure. As the night drew to a close, I could not shake the feeling of disappointment. All the politeness and consideration	1912	1900.9279
"It is not positively known that the sons of toil were themselves suffragists, but they could not have better befriended the cause if they had been. The appeal to their strength, whether by argument or money, was a stroke of political genius which the world is destined to recognise more and  151 more in women. Here was no trifling with the emergency such as they were used to at the hands of men whose meetings they themselves broke up in times past. These men, if they had been as wise as the women have shown themselves, would not have confronted the militants with squads of mild mannered policemen or a mob of chivalrous male spectators; they would have invoked the help of a corps of ""daughters of the plough, "" or their equivalent in brawny cooks and vigorous housemaids, who would have dealt with the militants as the dock labourers dealt with the students. It is rather against our contention that in a meeting in Hyde Park, held since the meeting in Glasgow, the suffragettes failed to provide themselves with a guard of dock labourers, and were pelted with mud and howled down by an audience differing from them in opinion."	Yet, despite this setback, the strategic employment of the working class in their campaigns was a marked shift from earlier, more genteel approaches to suffrage. It was a recognition that the movement must engage not just the minds but the physical presence of those who formed the backbone of the city's labor. The suffragettes understood that aligning their cause with the broader struggles of the working class could lend a visceral urgency to their fight for enfranchisement. This alliance, however imperfect, suggested a burgeoning awareness among the suffragettes of the intersectionality of oppression—a concept far ahead of its time. They began to see that the disenfranchisement of women was part of a larger pattern of marginalization that also affected the working poor, and that solidarity across these lines could be mutually beneficial. In the weeks following the Hyde Park debacle, there were earnest discussions within the movement about better ways to mobilize and protect their assemblies. Some argued for more rigorous self-defense training for women, while others continued to advocate for the support of sympathetic male workers who could shield the suffragettes from	1913	2005.2115
Both Philadelphia and Baltimore are opening up commanding arteries to the heart of the business district for the relief of traffic and the beautification of the city. Philadelphia has acquired property, for nearly a mile in length, from the City Hall to Fairmount Park, which is being cleared of buildings, and is to be developed into a parkway, like 1.^ E. H ItI, i •. riflSH > .»>.. — .- .r - i ■\ w i & * *''''<{ f -; rr~. - , .	the famous Champs-Élysées in Paris. This grand boulevard will not only serve as a thoroughfare for the increasing traffic but will also provide a scenic route connecting two of the city's most prominent landmarks, enhancing both utility and aesthetics. Meanwhile, Baltimore is undertaking a similar project with the creation of a wide avenue leading from the Inner Harbor to Druid Hill Park. Old structures are being demolished to make way for this expansive road, lined with trees and decorative lighting, designed to ease congestion while offering a pleasant visual experience to both residents and visitors alike. These initiatives reflect a growing recognition of the need to integrate functional urban planning with efforts to preserve and celebrate public spaces. As these cities embrace these changes, they are setting a precedent for others to follow, demonstrating that the health of a city's core can significantly impact its overall character and livability.	1913	2006.1827

"The picture which she gives of social life at the Capital during President Grant's administration is both vivid and amusing. And these letters and others which are to follow, written from various courts, giving as they do the writer's personal impressions of many men and women, both American and European, who have already taken their places in history, will be found of even more fascinatingly intimate interest than her earlier letters from Paris during the Commune and those describing her visits to the Court of Napoleon III. Washington, November. 1875. 'EAR MOTHER, — After my hurriedly written letter of the 24th you will know that we have arrived here safely. My first introduction to my first post as diplomat's wife was made unwittingly by a gentleman walking with a friend just behind me. ""Who is that gentleman?"" said he, indicating Johan. ""That?"	"Why, that is Mr. Johan Fredericks, the new attaché from the Netherlands."" The friend nodded appreciatively, and I felt a sudden swell of pride for Johan's recognition, albeit from strangers. The social whirl of Washington is in full swing, and I must confess, it is both exhilarating and exhausting. The air is charged with political intrigue and the salons buzz with gossip and speculation. At every dinner party and reception, the air is thick with the ambitions and machinations of statesmen and social climbers alike. Johan is adapting well to his diplomatic duties, though the pace and the politicking are relentless. As for myself, I am learning the intricate dance of diplomacy's social side. It is a delicate balance of listening and speaking, of revealing just enough but not too much. The ladies of the diplomatic corps have been kind, each in her own way, though I sense that every kindness comes with strings attached.

"L. T. H. ""ADAM SMITH AND MODERN SOCIOLOGY."" By Professor Albion Small. The University of Chicago Press. London : Fisher Unwin. This little book is a study in the methodology of the social sciences, and is declared by its author to be a portion of a larger and more complete investigation of the relations between nineteenth century social science and sociology, now in progress in the Seminar of Professor Small at the University of Chicago. In the introduction, Prof. Small, with the clearness which characterises all his writing, draws a sharp distinction between the present mental attitude of economists and that taken by Adam Smith in his "" Wealth of Nations."""	He argues that while Adam Smith approached economic phenomena with a broader sociological perspective, modern economists have tended to narrow their focus, concentrating on specific economic mechanisms and their immediate impacts. This, Small contends, has led to a fragmentation of understanding, where the economic is isolated from the social, and the true complexity of social life is often overlooked. Professor Small proposes that a return to the more integrative approach of Adam Smith could enrich both economics and sociology, offering a more comprehensive view of how economic behaviors shape and are shaped by social structures and cultural norms. Throughout the text, he meticulously analyzes Smith’s work, highlighting instances where Smith's insights align with contemporary sociological theories, and where they diverge. The book further discusses the implications of adopting a Smithian approach in modern social science research. Small emphasizes the importance of considering the moral, ethical, and social contexts within which economic transactions occur, arguing that this perspective is crucial for addressing the challenges of modern society. In the concluding chapters, Small outlines a vision for a new synthesis of economics and sociology, one that embraces interdisciplinary methods and seeks to understand the	1908	2007.0167

YET another attempt to improve the colour of the mercury lamp is announced by Dr. M. Wolke, * who finds that he can supply the missing lines in the spectrum by the addition of cadmium. The attempt to introduce foreign meta's into the mercury tube with this object has been tried before and failed. But it is stated that the early difficulties have now been overcome.	Dr. Wolke’s method involves a careful control over the proportion of mercury and cadmium, as well as the pressure within the tube. By adjusting these parameters, he has been able to achieve a more balanced spectrum that significantly enhances the quality of light emitted. The inclusion of cadmium not only fills in the spectral gaps typically present in mercury lamps but also stabilizes the arc, resulting in a steadier light output. This stabilization is crucial as it reduces flickering, which has been a common complaint among users of traditional mercury lamps. The new Mercury Cadmium Lamp also boasts improved efficiency. Preliminary tests indicate that the specific consumption might be lowered further, potentially reaching efficiencies better than 0.65 watts per H.K. This is a notable improvement over the current models and promises not only better light quality but also reduced energy consumption. Furthermore, Dr. Wolke has addressed the issue of the environmental impact of using cadmium, a heavy metal with significant toxicity. The design of the lamp ensures that the cadmium is securely contained, and the lamp is constructed to be easily recyclable, mitigating	1912	2003.9099
It is found that if the Pitot tube is not very small in diameter (less than 0 05 inches), the size and bluntness of the opening can be varied very considerably without affecting the pressure in the tube. The largest diameter tested has been 2J inches, whilst the bluntness has been varied from that corresponding with a hole in a circular plate to a tube turned to a sharp edge. fio Much greater difficulty has been experienced in obtaining a measurement from which the atmospheric pressure in the air current can be determined. This was finally obtained by drilling small holes in the side of a tube which is held with its axis along the wind. The holes are usually 10 or 12 in number and about 0'03 inch in diameter for a tube | inch diameter.	The arrangement of these holes is critical; they must be evenly spaced around the circumference of the tube to ensure that they are equally exposed to the pressure of the airstream from all directions. This setup helps to average out the dynamic effects of the air swirling around the tube, which can otherwise lead to inaccuracies in the pressure measurement. To further refine the accuracy, the tube itself is often streamlined to minimize disturbance to the flow. The interior of the tube is meticulously smoothed to reduce any resistance that might alter the flow characteristics inside the tube, where the pressure is being measured. The external factors such as air density, temperature, and humidity also play a significant role in the accuracy of the pressure readings obtained from the Pitot tube. Therefore, it is essential to calibrate the instrument under similar conditions to those in which it will be used, or to apply necessary corrections based on the known variations in these parameters. This method of using a Pitot tube with multiple side holes for measuring atmospheric pressure in an air current is particularly useful in applications where precise airspeed measurements are crucial, such as in aerodynamic testing	1912	1979.1456
In other respects this brief life of Mark Twain is thoroughly satisfactory and as interesting as a well written romance; for, indeed, the life of a virile American boy, gifted with imagination and into the web and woof of whose life entered so many stirring incidents and unexpected happenings, is as strange and fascinating as fiction, and Professor Henderson brings his subject very near to the mental vision and the heart of the reader. The volume is beautifully illustrated with two coloured portraits of Mark Twain and numerous photographic reproductions, all the pictures having been made by Alvan Langdon Coburn. The Dork Lectures. By T. Troward. Pp.	"312. London: Routledge & Sons, Ltd. These lectures, delivered by T. Troward at the Dork Institute, have been collected into a single volume that promises to be of considerable interest to those studying the intersections of philosophy, metaphysics, and practical psychology. Troward’s insights are delivered in a clear, engaging style that reflects his deep understanding of mental science and its application to personal development and the broader social fabric. Each lecture builds upon the previous, constructing a comprehensive framework that challenges and expands the reader’s perspective on the mind and its capabilities. As Troward navigates through complex topics such as the law of attraction, the function of the subconscious mind, and the pursuit of spiritual growth, he provides practical advice and philosophical commentary that is both thought-provoking and accessible. This makes ""The Dork Lectures"" an invaluable resource not only for scholars and students but also for anyone interested in the potential for personal transformation through mental science. The fullness of Troward’s lectures combined with his methodical approach will undoubtedly leave readers both enlightened and inspired to explore"	1911	2006.0562
The industrial effects of Swadeshi, however, are perhaps the least important from the sociological standpoint. Its principal justification, to the Indian mind, is that it represents a general revolt against the moral and social decadence that afflicts a subject people grown quiescent under alien domination. Mr. Gokhale says: — Of these moral evils none is so great as this continuous dwarfing or stunting of our race that is taking place under your rule.	This dwarfing is not merely in the physical sense, though that too is a concern, but more grievously in the mental and spiritual realms. The imposition of foreign values and systems has gradually eroded the native self-esteem and initiative, leading to a state of cultural and intellectual dependency. Swadeshi, then, is not just an economic strategy; it is a cultural resurgence, an assertion of self-reliance, and a reclamation of indigenous identity and dignity. The movement seeks to revive traditional industries that have languished under the pressure of imported goods, yes, but its deeper aim is to instill a sense of pride and possibility in the Indian populace. By encouraging the consumption of goods produced within India, Swadeshi strengthens internal markets and fosters a sense of community and interconnectedness. It is a direct challenge to the pervasive belief that anything foreign is inherently superior, a belief that has been systematically ingrained in the minds of the colonized. Moreover, the movement serves as a platform for political engagement and activism, providing a means for the common people to contribute to the struggle for independence	1908	1996.1053

Perry's squadron  — m z r,   Perry's Fleet in put in Bay numbered nine vessels, and bore fifty four carriage guns and two swivels. Barclay had thirty fire long guns to Perry's fifteen, and possessed greatly the advantage in action at a distance. In close action, the weight of metal was with the Americans, and for that reason Perry had resolved to close upon the enemy at once. The British commander had one hundred and fifty men from the royal navy, eighty Canadian sailors, two hundred and forty soldiers, mostly regulars, and some Indians. His whole force, officers and men, was a little more than five hundred.	"Perry's force, although slightly smaller in terms of manpower, consisting of around four hundred and ninety men, was highly motivated and well-trained. The American sailors were a mix of seasoned veterans and vigorous young recruits, eager to prove their mettle in combat. Additionally, Perry had the advantage of having several experienced officers who had previously served in notable naval engagements. As the dawn broke on the day of the battle, the air was tense with anticipation. Perry, aware of his disadvantages in long-range firepower, planned his strategy around a rapid advancement to close quarters where his ships' heavier carronades could be brought to bear effectively against the British fleet. His famous flag, bearing the words ""Don't Give Up the Ship"", fluttered inspiringly above the lead ship, the USS Lawrence, as they moved into position. The battle commenced with the British fleet attempting to utilize their long-range guns, pounding Perry’s advancing ships with broadsides. Despite sustaining heavy damage, Perry's fleet continued to close the distance, enduring the relentless cannonades. As they drew nearer, the American ships unleashed a furious"	1913	1975.9989

The correspondence between them stops there; and, judging by it, one might feel tempted to believe that Garrick had made a generous offer without having any intention of letting it cost him dear. The following letter will, however, correct that impression and show that he had instructed his banker at Paris to honour any call that Mole might make on him, but that that gentleman had not attempted to avail himself of his friend's generosity: August 22, 1765."	Dear Sir, I am in receipt of your last, and am much obliged for your continued attention to the arrangements we discussed. I have spoken to my banker in Paris, Mr. Arnauld, and have instructed him that he is to honor any drafts which you may have the need to make in relation to our recent conversations. I trust this will serve as a sufficient guarantee of my commitment and good faith. I am somewhat perplexed, however, to hear that you have not yet availed yourself of this provision. I hope there has been no misunderstanding on this point, and that Mr. Arnauld's services will be found satisfactory. Please do not hesitate to make use of the resources I have placed at your disposal, as it was my intention from the beginning to support your endeavors fully.

Livingston, 35 Mo. 493 represented a pivotal case in the understanding of agency law within the context of state jurisprudence. The ruling underscored the principle that an agent's authority is confined to the scope explicitly or implicitly outlined by the principal. This case, alongside Eddy v. Livingston, has been frequently cited in subsequent legal arguments to illustrate the boundaries of agency relationships. Continuing, Grant v. Moody, as recorded in Wniiesell v. Hill, further delves into the liabilities and responsibilities an agent holds when acting on behalf of a principal. This case highlighted the legal expectations for agents to act within their granted authority and emphasized the repercussions of exceeding such authority. Moreover, the interpretation of agency dynamics was also enriched by the ruling in Chapman v. Walton, where the court examined the nuances of implied authority and its limits. This case is often referenced for its exploration of how far an agent's actions can bind a principal without direct authorization. These cases collectively contribute to the complex tapestry of agency law, providing foundational judgments that help define the operational boundaries between agents and their	1913	2005.6313
"A further development in the action of remedies according to the above law will make the practice of medicine akin to science. I am opposed to restrictive medical legislation because, as I understand it, every individual in the United States is guaranteed the ""right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, "" supposedly in his own way up to the point of infringement upon the like rights of other men; and when they would tell me that any one may with justice be granted the right by law to compel me to accept as fact the assertions of a medical clique and submit my body to its practises, however unreasonable and obnoxious they may be to me, they outrage every sense of right and justice and transgress every law of independence. Hence I oppose them. The law ought to protect the sick in their efforts to regain lost health by any means whatsoever that appeal to them as the best, and no opportunity to do so should be taken away by law."	In this regard, the principle of autonomy must be held sacred. The individual's freedom to choose their method of healing is an intrinsic part of their liberty. It is not merely a question of medical preferences, but a fundamental human right to self-determination regarding one's health. The role of the government should therefore be not to limit, but to facilitate access to a diverse range of therapeutic options, ensuring that all practices meet basic standards of safety and efficacy. The advance of medical science is undeniably beneficial and has the potential to improve lives significantly. However, it must not become a tyranny. The imposition of a singular medical ideology not only stifles innovation but also ignores the rich tapestry of human culture and the variety of ways in which different societies understand and treat illness. The wisdom of traditional remedies, honed through generations, should not be disregarded simply because they do not conform to contemporary scientific methods. Moreover, the diversity in human physiology means that what works for one individual may not work for another. Personalized medicine, which tailors treatments to the individual based on genetic, environmental, and	1911	1995.8975
It is not quite so easy to estimate the effect of neglecting the squares of p, q, r, c, in equations (6), and the only instance for. which a solution has been attempted is the case of changing from horizontal to gliding flight through an angle of 10 degrees. It was found that the essential features of the change are indicated with sufficient accuracy by the simpler analysis of small oscillations. The more complete analysis proved to be very tedious, and more powerful methods are under consideration before further extensions are undertaken. Athough not yet rigidly demonstrated, there is reason to believe that the indications of the approximate mathematical theory will cover the disturbances incidental to flying in all but extreme cases.	For example, when considering the transition from steady horizontal flight to a steady climb, the basic assumptions of linearity in the variables and the small angle approximations seem to hold well for practical purposes. In this context, the neglected higher-order terms, while theoretically significant, do not appear to introduce critical errors in the predictions for normal operational conditions. This suggests that for routine flight maneuvers within the usual operational envelope, the simplified equations provide an adequate basis for understanding and predicting the behavior of the aircraft. However, in scenarios involving more abrupt or severe changes, such as those encountered in aerobatic maneuvers or in critical flight situations like stalls or spins, the limitations of the simplified analysis become more apparent. Here, the non-linear characteristics and the effects of larger angular displacements can significantly influence the dynamics of the aircraft, necessitating a more detailed and robust modeling approach. To address these more complex situations, higher-order terms and non-linear dynamics must be incorporated into the analysis. This involves not only more complex mathematics but also more intensive computational resources. Current research is focused on developing computational methods that can efficiently handle these complexities	1912	1995.8702

Air parcels above the immediate surface layer participate in the cooling but to a lesser degree. At altitudes of 3000 to 4000 feet, little or no nocturnal cooling occurs. To illustrate the manner in which air cools at night, the surface atmosphere is divided into layers in Figure 121. Each layer is 100 feet thick with the exception of the surface which cools 33F during the particular night in question. Lowering of temperature in each layer is considered to be uniform, which it is in reality if the layers are thin. One of the most important features of Figure 121 is the illustration of differences in total amounts of cooling experienced by successive elevations on a hillside.	"As shown, the cooling is most intense near the surface and gradually diminishes with altitude. This phenomenon is known as ""temperature inversion,"" where warmer air lies above cooler air, a reversal of the typical temperature gradient during the day when the air closest to the surface is usually warmer. Temperature inversions are significant because they can lead to the trapping of cold air at the surface, contributing to frost in valleys and lower slopes despite warmer temperatures at higher altitudes. Furthermore, the diagram in Figure 121 demonstrates how the cooling rate decreases as one moves up the hill. For example, the layer from 100 to 200 feet might cool by 28°F, while the layer from 500 to 600 feet cools by only 15°F. This stratification can have practical implications for agriculture, as frost-sensitive crops could be planted at higher elevations to avoid the colder temperatures found in lower regions during night-time. Additionally, these inversions can affect air quality. Since the cooler, denser air does not rise, any pollutants released near the surface are not dispersed but rather accumulate, leading to higher"	1913	2004.367
"He realised that he was "" run down."" He told Pinkerton Britt, who came in wild - eyed from an interview with the casket agent, that he believed he had "" spring fever."" Tom Bowman fled to the creek after a desperate encounter with her. He was nervous and depressed. Whatever Sally did or said, he felt that he could only calm himself in this soothing pursuit. None of them went home to their midday dinner. But Mrs. Fuller was far from being discouraged. In fact, she was just beginning to cheer up. During the afternoon she made a canvas from house to house."	She carried with her an air of indefatigable optimism, her smile never wavering even as doors were shut in her face or as she received the umpteenth polite but firm refusal. Yet, she plowed on, her belief in her cause unshaken, her determination only steeling further with each setback.  Mrs. Fuller knew the importance of the community project she was advocating for, and she was convinced that with enough persistence, she could sway the town to her side. By late afternoon, her efforts began to bear fruit. At one house, a kindly old gentleman, intrigued by her passion, invited her in for tea and listened intently as she outlined her plans. He promised not only his support but also to speak with his neighbors. Energized by this small victory, Mrs. Fuller continued her rounds with renewed vigor. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows over the quaint streets, Mrs. Fuller made her way back home, her basket lighter but her spirit buoyed by the progress she had made. She knew the road ahead was long and fraught with more	1913	1913.1018
"In order to master its technique, he made elaborate measurements on all easily crystallizable tartrates, thus revealing the fact that his curiosity concerning the two known tartaric acids had remained lively throughout the preceding two years. In the meantime he was working toward the doctorate, which he achieved August 23, 1847, on the strength of two small papers, the one entitled ""Researches on the Saturation Capacities of Arsenious Acid: A Study of the Arsenites of Soda, Potassa and Ammonia, "" and the other ""A Study of the Phenomena Relative to the Polarisation of Liquids."" He himself said of these papers, ""They are elementary, and little more than programmes for future work."" Again he attained but poor ranking. He now desired to study in Germany; but poverty frustrated his plans."	Undeterred, he sought out alternative opportunities closer to home. He managed to secure a position as an assistant in a chemical laboratory, which, although modest, provided him with the means to continue his research. This role also allowed him to interact with other scientists and to access a variety of chemical substances and instruments that were not available to him previously. It was during this period that his interest in molecular asymmetry began to take a definitive shape. His days were long and the work was tedious, but his passion for chemistry kept him motivated. He spent countless hours in the laboratory, experimenting with various organic compounds and analyzing their crystalline structures. His meticulous nature and relentless pursuit of understanding the properties of these compounds slowly began to yield results. He developed new techniques for analyzing molecular structures, which would later prove crucial in his discoveries. Despite the lack of substantial financial resources and limited access to advanced equipment, his determination and ingenuity led to significant breakthroughs. He began to gain recognition in academic circles for his innovative approaches and his deep understanding of chemical processes. This recognition eventually led to more substantial opportunities, including	1911	2002.9178
"The accompanying illustration shows the design of the cover of this folder. The B.T.H. "" Eye rest"" System. We have on previous occasions referred to the value of indirect illumination, a notable example of which is The British Thomson houston Company's "" Eye Rest "" system. In principle the "" Eye Rest "" system is similar to other indirect lighting systems — that is to say, the light from the lamp is first thrown on the ceiling, which in turn reflects it down on to the working plane. The fittings consist of upturned reflectors in ornamental metal or plaster bowls s u s pended by chains from a ceil ing plate. A very efficient reflector is used in the fi t t i n g s, made of silvered glass, with spiral c o r r uga tions which effectually correct any striatioii of the light."	"The real advantage of this system lies in the minimization of glare, which is often the cause of significant eye strain in environments where people are required to focus on tasks for long periods. By diffusing the light indirectly, the ""Eye Rest"" system creates a softer, more uniform light that reduces harsh shadows and contrast. This makes it particularly suitable for offices, libraries, and any other settings where reading or detailed work is frequently done. Additionally, the aesthetic appeal of the system should not be underestimated. The ornamental bowls, available in various designs, add a decorative element to any interior space, blending functionality with style. This is particularly important in public or commercial spaces, where the visual environment contributes to the overall ambiance and user experience. Moreover, the use of silvered glass reflectors not only enhances the efficiency of the light distribution but also contributes to energy savings. By maximizing the reflectance of the light upwards and reducing the need for direct lighting, the system can operate with lower wattage bulbs or fewer fixtures overall, thus contributing to a greener and more sustainable lighting solution.

The subject ib referred to in detail at a later stage of this report. Continuing the analysis of the motion of the machine adopted for the purpose, it is now necessary to solve equations (35) and (36).

The real parts of the roots represent the damping factors, and their negative values confirm the stability of the system. The imaginary parts, on the other hand, correspond to the oscillatory nature of the system, indicating the frequency of oscillations around the equilibrium position. To further validate these findings, a phase portrait analysis was conducted. This involved plotting the trajectories in the phase space to visualize the system's behavior over time. The trajectories consistently spiraled towards the origin, further confirming the damping effect and stability of the system. Moreover, the eigenvalues derived from the characteristic equations provide insights into the system's response to perturbations. The eigenvalues with negative real parts reinforce the system's ability to return to stability after being disturbed. The complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues, with their associated imaginary parts, suggest a sinusoidal response with a decaying amplitude, typical of underdamped systems. This analysis not only supports the theoretical predictions but also provides a practical approach to visualize and understand the dynamic behavior of the machine. Future work	1912	2001.1696
"This place was held strongly by British Infantry, many members of the Legion of Frontiersmen, — distinguished only by the little bronze badge in their buttonholes, — and also by hundreds of citizens armed with rifles. Twenty Germans dropped at the first volley, and next instant a Maxim, concealed in the first floor of a neighbouring house, spat forth its fire upon the invaders with deadly effect. The German bugle sounded the "" Advance rapidly, "" and the men emulously ran forward, shouting loud hurrahs. Major von Wittich, who had distinguished himself very conspicuously in the fighting around Enfield Chase, fell, being shot through the lung when just within a few yards of the half ruined barricade. Londoners were fighting desperately, shouting and cheering."	The air was thick with the smoke of gunpowder, and the sharp, acrid scent mingled with the cries of men and the continuous roar of gunfire. The streets, once familiar and peaceful, had transformed into chaotic battlegrounds where every corner and window might hide a sniper. The defenders, a mix of seasoned soldiers and hastily armed civilians, held their ground with a fierce determination, knowing the very heart of their city was at stake. As the German forces regrouped for another charge, the defenders quickly reloaded their weapons, patched up their wounded, and reinforced their positions. Women and children, far from being mere bystanders, aided in the defense by supplying ammunition, tending to the injured, or even taking up arms themselves when the situation became dire. The clash was brutal and unrelenting. Buildings that had stood for centuries were now pockmarked with bullet holes or shattered by shell fire. Yet, amid the destruction, the spirit of London endured, fueled by a blend of fear, anger, and a deep-seated resolve not to let their city fall. As the	1906	1987.5221
"It is selected to be the object of special denunciation, while others resembling it precisely pass utterly unchallenged. Ignorance of this sort of transition of verbs — one of the most common phenomena of our speech — is largely responsible for the senseless clamour which sometimes arises. Great writers have occasionally been affected by it. During the time that ""The Bride of Abydos"" was passing through the press Byron had the folly to look into a dictionary and the greater folly, at that time particularly, of accepting its statements as final. From this examination he discovered, what no one else had previously known, that murmur was not a transitive verb. Only the neuter use of it was recorded in the dictionaries of Dr. Johnson and later lexicographers."	"In a fit of sudden doubt and concern, motivated by the strictures of the dictionary, Byron wrote hastily to his publisher, urging that the proofs be altered to correct what he now feared was a grammatical error. This led to a flurry of activity, with messengers dispatched and printers consulted, all in a bid to align the great poet's work with the perceived rules of language laid down by the lexicographers. But as the dust settled, Byron's friends and literary advisors urged him to reconsider. They pointed out the fluid and evolving nature of language, highlighting how usage often leads rather than follows the formal record of dictionaries. Language, they argued, is not merely a set of rules to be followed, but a living, breathing means of expression that adapts and changes over time. Convinced by these arguments, Byron eventually instructed that the original text be restored, embracing the poetic license that allowed ""murmur"" to function transitively in his verse. This incident, though minor in the grand scheme of his literary life, underscored the tension between prescriptive and descriptive approaches to language"	1913	1962.5985
"Facing half round, he drew himself up very straight and proper. His head looked disproportionately large, even for his large frame, because of the thick growth of hair that touched his coat collar and overran the lower part of his face; his hands, held stiffly at his sides, were concealed to the knuckles by his brown coat sleeves; his blue trousers did not cover his big ankles; but he stood at the side of the road like a soldier, and like a soldier to his superior officer he said: ""Good evening, Reverend Doctor."" He received a very friendly greeting in return, and held his military attitude for a couple of minutes, only moving his head to prolong a gaze full of unobtrusive adoration. ""Poor Joe! There is one person who believes in me, "" thought the minister."	"And indeed, Joe's faith was of the unshakeable kind, born not of doctrine or dogma, but of a deep-seated conviction in the goodness that he saw personified in the Reverend Doctor. Despite his rough exterior and his somewhat ungainly stance, there was a clear light of sincerity and respect in his eyes that spoke more eloquently than words ever could. The minister, touched by this display of genuine reverence, paused a moment before continuing on his way. ""Joe, it's always good to see you standing guard over our little community,"" he said with a warmth that made Joe's face break into a broad, if somewhat shy, smile. ""Thank you, sir. Just doing what I can,"" Joe replied, his voice gruff but not without a note of pride. He watched as the Reverend walked away, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. In his simple but profound loyalty, Joe found a kind of ministry of his own, standing sentinel not just over the physical byways of the town, but over its moral pathways as well."	1913	1954.8422
LEON GASTER. 277 Review of Contents of this Issue. THE TECHNICAL SECTION in the present number opens with an article on the Lighting of Cotton Hills (p. 279). The author discusses the requirements for work of this kind, pointing out the necessity for good illumination when complicated machinery and intricate manipulation of the tread thread have to be supervised. Good daylight is also essential. Prismatic glassware is coming into use in order to improve the natural conditions and the shape of modern buildings is also being designed to the same end. Following this will be found the text of several important questions asked in the House of Commons by MB. ARTHUR LYNCH, urging the value of a Commission on the Hygienic Aspects of Illumination.	This is particularly relevant given the increasing concern over workers' health in industrial settings. Mr. Lynch's advocacy underscores the growing recognition of environmental factors in workplace safety and efficiency. The questions he raised have prompted discussions about the need for comprehensive studies to determine optimal lighting conditions that not only enhance productivity but also safeguard the health of workers. Continuing in the TECHNICAL SECTION, there is an insightful examination of the latest advancements in steam turbine technology by DR. HAROLD MARSH. Dr. Marsh details the improvements in turbine blade design and the integration of compound cycles that have led to significant increases in thermal efficiency. He also explores the implications of these advancements for both maritime and stationary power generation applications. Furthermore, the section includes a review of recent patents in the field of wireless telegraphy. With the rapid expansion of this technology, inventors and engineers have introduced a variety of new mechanisms and techniques aimed at improving signal reliability and transmission distance. This review not only highlights the inventive activity in this burgeoning field but also provides a glimpse into the potential future developments that could revolutionize communication. Lastly, this issue's	1912	2001.8351
Such cases come up not infrequently; such are contracts to construct waterworks or irrigation ditches, canals or sewers when the appropriation or pollution of the water would be an unlawful act, or to drive a tunnel under a government fortress, as occurred on the West Shore Railroad at West Point. The question has been asked '3 Fed. Rep. 1; Hager o.Cal1in. 18 Hun 448 [I879]; Slaunton 12. Parker, 19 Hun 55 1879 . [ *2 lhner. & Eng Ency Law 366. ‘ See a good collection of cases in 9 Amer. & Eng. Ency. Law 879-930. ‘Cuanan o. Bryce, 3 B. & Ald.179; Mc Kimmel 12. Robinson, 3 M. & W. 434.	In such situations, the courts are often called upon to adjudicate on the legality and enforceability of these contracts under the prevailing laws. Contracts that involve illegal acts are generally declared void ab initio, meaning they are considered invalid from the outset. This principle is grounded in the policy that no court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or illegal act. For instance, in the case of a contract to construct a tunnel under a government fortress, the court would consider whether the act of tunneling could constitute a threat to national security or violate specific statutory provisions. If so, such a contract would likely be void for illegality.  Moreover, the doctrine of severability may be considered if the contract contains some provisions that are legal and others that are not. The court might decide to enforce the legal parts if they can be separated from the illegal ones without defeating the primary objective of the contract. It is also noteworthy that the parties to an illegal contract cannot seek the aid of the law to enforce their rights under that contract or recover damages for breach of such	1913	1967.951
"We were looking at some distant mountains which were in the full sunshine. Suddenly a dark shadowy looking mass shot across the sky and struck one of the mountain peaks some distance down from the top. The peak seemed to be immediately demolished, and vanished from our sight! M'Allister gazed spellbound ; but John excitedly exclaimed: "" Did you see that, Professor ? One moment the peak was there, and the next moment it was gone !"" "" Yes, "" I said. "" Undoubtedly that dark shadow was a large meteoric stone."	"It must have been of considerable size and velocity to have such an impact. The energy released by such collisions can be quite extraordinary.""  John, still overwhelmed by the spectacle, questioned further, ""But where did the peak go, Professor? How can something so massive just disappear in an instant?"" ""Well,"" I began, explaining patiently, ""when a meteor strikes with such force, it can pulverize rock into very fine dust which may be dispersed by the shockwave or even by the subsequent air currents. What's more, the intense heat generated by the impact can melt or even vaporize parts of the mountain. Essentially, the solid rock is transformed so rapidly and drastically that it seems to vanish."" M'Allister, now regaining his composure, added, ""It's a stark reminder of the powerful and unpredictable forces of nature. The universe holds many such surprises."" ""Yes, indeed,"" I nodded.

FIG. 7. — View of an interesting old mansion in Rutlandshire. Fio. 8.	— Diagram illustrating the effects of improper versus proper lighting in a domestic setting. The consumer often prefers a brightly lit room, but this can lead to issues such as glare, which is not only uncomfortable but can also be detrimental to both eye health and the aesthetics of the room. Proper lighting, on the other hand, enhances the room's features without causing discomfort or visual strain. FIG. 9. — A detailed layout of a well-lit study room in the same Rutlandshire mansion, showing the placement of lamps and natural light sources. This demonstrates how strategic lighting can be used not only to illuminate a space but also to create an atmosphere conducive to reading and writing, crucial in a study. In addressing these considerations, it is essential to balance intensity, direction, and the quality of light. The right conditions often depend on the specific function of the room and the tasks performed there. For instance, a kitchen requires bright, uniform light to ensure safety in food preparation, whereas a bedroom may benefit from softer, more diffuse lighting to create a relaxing environment.

"The prisoners taken from the Germans in the various preliminary skirmishes also made no bones of boasting that a direct attack was imminent, and our commander in Chief eventually, and rightly as it proved, determined to take the risk of all this information having been specially promulgated by the German Staff to cover totally different intentions, as was indeed quite probable, and to accept it as true. Having made up his mind, he lost no time in taking action. He ordered the ivth Corps under Sir William Packington to move on Potton, twelve miles to the northwest, as soon as it was dark. As many cavalry and mounted infantry as could possibly be spared from Royston were placed at his disposal. """	The movement was to be executed with the utmost secrecy, the men advancing under cover of the night to minimize the risk of detection by enemy scouts. The troops, weary yet resolute, prepared for the march, their spirits buoyed by the thought of engaging the enemy on more favorable terms. The roads were muddy, the weather inclement, but the urgency of the situation left no room for delay.  By midnight, the ivth Corps had reached the outskirts of Potton, the men moving silently through the shadows, the only sounds the muffled tramp of boots and the occasional clink of equipment. The cavalry, their horses' hooves wrapped in cloth to deaden the sound, scouted ahead, vigilant for any sign of the enemy. Sir William Packington, aware of the weight of responsibility resting on his shoulders, rode among his men, his presence a reassuring signal in the dim moonlight. His orders were clear: secure Potton by dawn, and establish a defensive perimeter before the Germans could react. The element of surprise was their greatest asset, and he intended to exploit it	1906	1904.7252

"The Colonel showed himself tremendously enthusiastic about his new duties. Next morning at breakfast I opened the post bag as usual and, with some slight misgiving, handed my wife a letter from Messrs. Jones, Wilkinson & Co. The Colonel was helping himself to fish when she opened it and had his back turned to us. My wife read the letter, glanced at an enclosure which it contained, and then made an exclamation. "" This isn't my envelope!"" she said. The Colonel turned at once. Some instinct must have led him to expect a mysterious crime. His face wore that look of keen determination which is proper to an eminent detective. I glanced through the letter of Jones & Wilkinson."	It was addressed to a Mr. Edward Marlowe, concerning an urgent matter of a financial nature. The envelope, however, bore my wife’s name clearly on the front. The mix-up was peculiar and not a little disconcerting. “Are you certain, my dear?” I asked, taking the letter from her hands to examine it myself. The contents were indeed not meant for us—a detailed discussion about stock transfers and deadlines for a substantial payment. “Yes, look!” she insisted, pointing to the printed name and address at the top of the letterhead inside. The Colonel, having abandoned his breakfast, came over and peered over my shoulder. “A most curious error,” he murmured, his eyes narrowing slightly as he read the letter. “And potentially quite distressing for this Mr. Marlowe if he is unaware of these urgent financial concerns.” He straightened up, the detective persona fully assumed now. “It would seem we have a small mystery on our hands. Misdelivered post could be a simple mistake by the postal service, or perhaps something more deliberate.	1913	1924.0853

The mother thrilled with pride over her children, who were claiming so regally their inheritance of poise and significance. She tried to exchange a surreptitious glance of content and gratulation with the man who made all this possible, but he was talking with Mrs. Favart. Mrs. Wilson heard him say: ""Hannah's terrapin is always good. But I agree with you, this time she has excelled herself."" It was too good to miss. ""But it isn't Hannah's!"" The exclamation reached the other end of the table. ""Not Hannah's!"" Wilson smiled at a suspected joke. He could not be fooled in Hannah's terrapin."	"""Indeed, it's not,"" Mrs. Wilson interjected, her voice carrying a mix of amusement and pride. ""This time, it was Peter who took to the kitchen. He insisted on trying his hand at the recipe."" A murmur of impressed surprise rippled around the table, eyes turning towards Peter who looked somewhat bashful yet pleased with the acknowledgment. Mr. Beveridge, with a raised eyebrow, gave a nod of approval. ""Well, the young man has certainly outdone himself,"" he declared, which elicited a round of nods and murmurs of agreement. Peter, feeling the weight of the attention, managed a modest smile. ""I had a good teacher,"" he said, nodding towards his mother. The room filled with the warm laughter of shared appreciation.

The complexity of the stress profile in a rectangular section with sharp corners is due to the discontinuity in geometry at the transition between the flange and the web. This discontinuity causes stress concentrations which are particularly high at the corners. To analyze this, the section modulus for each part of the beam (flange and web) must be considered separately. For the flange, the stress at a height \( y \) from the neutral axis can be expressed as: \[ \sigma = \frac{M}{I} y \] where \( M \) is the bending moment, and \( I \) is the second moment of area (or moment of inertia) for the flange. Moving into the web, the stress calculation must account for the narrower width \( b \) compared to \( B \) in the flange. The moment of inertia for the web, considering it acts alone, would be calculated with respect to its own centroid, and then transformed to the neutral axis of the entire section. This transformation is necessary to ensure that all parts of the	1908	1989.575
They had come in a vast, tumultuous horde, to win or waste; and off they stampeded to new worlds, the boldest of them, when the news of richer places came shouting over the desert from the sea — jumped from the January heat and blistering light of the Coolgardie drylands to the January cold and long night of the Yukon.	Such was the restless spirit of these adventurers, ever chasing the next horizon where fortunes were rumored to be built overnight. The tales of gold in far-off lands ignited fires in their hearts that no hardship could extinguish. They braved oceans and trekked across untamed wildernesses, driven by dreams of wealth that could lift them from their ordinary lives into realms of legendary prosperity. Each new rush was a siren's call, promising adventure and the chance to write their names across the pages of history. As they departed from one boomtown, leaving behind the skeletal remains of hastily built shanties and the echoes of once bustling streets, they carried with them only the essentials and the gritty determination to start anew. This cycle of boom and bust was the pulse of their existence, a rhythm learned by heart and felt in the marrow of their bones. In the Yukon, the vast, frozen landscapes tested their mettle as they panned icy streams and dug into permafrost, always with the hope that the next shovel full of earth would reveal the gleam of gold. Around campfires,	1913	1982.3512
"The aim is to secure a more human, home like milieu under good personal influence with the best training for the after career, in place of the old unintelligent "" institutional "" methods. Of the total of 69,000 children under care on January 1st, 1907, only 14,676 were living in the Workhouses, apart from 6,690 under treatment in the Infirmaries; the rest were distributed in District and Separate Schools (11,809); in other Training Homes and Schools (8,450); in Cottage Homes (about 11,000); in Scattered Homes (4,963) ; while 8,659 were boarded out in private homes under supervision. Even those now left in the Workhouses attend the public elementary schools where they mix with other children. It is clear that we have a very important experiment in progress, and the general policy appears to be amply justified by the record of the results in the after careers both in England and in Canada, whither over 7000 have been sent since 1883; there is evidence that the essential end of the development of character along with a good training for life work is being attained. Taking 11,000 of the children in the metropolitan area, the average cost of each child amounted to lls. 3d. per week, and of this 4s. 7d. was for ""Maintenance"" (Provisions, Necessaries and Clothing); the cost for provisions alone was equal to 4d. a day. PERIODICAL LITERATURE 315 PERIODICAL LITERATURE."	"The burgeoning field of periodical literature has become a significant force in shaping public opinion and disseminating knowledge across a broad spectrum of subjects. Magazines and journals, both general and specialized, are proliferating at a rate never before seen, catering to the tastes and interests of an increasingly literate populace. From the literary reviews in ""The Athenaeum"" to the scientific explorations in ""Nature,"" this medium offers a platform for intellectual discourse and entertainment alike. The influence of such publications is not limited to the educated classes alone. With the expansion of the public education system, a wider audience has gained access to these resources, bridging the gap between the elite and the masses. This democratization of knowledge through periodical literature serves not only to inform but also to inspire and provoke thought among its readers. Moreover, the role of periodical literature in advocacy cannot be overlooked. Many journals have taken strong stances on social issues, from the rights of workers to the suffrage movement, influencing public policy and societal norms. As we move further into the 20th century, the power of the press"	1908	1971.6395
The Constitution further provides for the gradual disbandment of all military and naval forces not required to act as international and supplementary national police. An international language is to be recognised, with a standardisation of money, weights and measures, and an international sociological bureau is to concern itself with the collection and communication of all forms of knowledge, industrial, educational and other by means of which a real community of interests, tastes and ideas may be forwarded. J. A. H.  OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS 403 OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS. REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HOME WORK, 1908, No. 246.	The report discusses the conditions under which home-based work is carried out, emphasizing the need for better regulation and oversight to ensure fair wages and safe working environments. It highlights the prevalence of home work in industries such as garment making, shoe repairs, and various handicrafts, where workers, often women and children, are subjected to long hours and low pay without the benefits and protections typically afforded to factory workers. The Select Committee made several recommendations including the establishment of minimum wage standards for home workers, the implementation of more rigorous inspections to enforce these standards, and the creation of a registry for all home workers to facilitate these inspections and provide a clearer picture of the scale and scope of home-based employment. Additionally, the report suggests educational initiatives to help home workers improve their skills, thus enabling them to command higher wages and better working conditions. Furthermore, the committee acknowledges the role of middlemen in the home work industry, often critiqued for exploiting laborers by taking large cuts of their earnings. The report proposes stricter controls and transparency regarding the payment processes to ensure fairer distribution of income. These measures, the	1908	2003.472
"My father's taken Mr. Glenwilliam out of the way, and I shall disappear shortly."" 762 ""And what the deuce is going to happen?"" Marion replied that she had no idea. Enid had certainly been seeing a great deal of Arthur Coryston; London, her father reported, was full of talk; and Miss Atherstone thought that from his manner the Chancellor knew very well what was going on. ""And can't stick it?"" cried Coryston, his eyes shining. ""Glenwilliam has his faults, but I don't believe he'll want Arthur for a son-in-law — even with the estates. And of course he has no chance of getting both Arthur and the estates."" ""Because of your mother?"" Coryston nodded.

You know I will."" Coryston gave a short, sharp laugh, a sound that seemed to carry more nerves than humor. ""Good! Because if there's one thing that lady deserves, it's a bit of respect, despite all her quirks. Heaven knows she's had a rough enough time with my father."" The mention of his father seemed to shadow his face temporarily, a cloud passing over a determined sun. He stood up, pacing slightly, his hands clasped behind his back. Marion watched him, knowing better than to interrupt his thought process. Finally, he stopped and faced her again. ""And what about you, Marion? How are you holding up in all this mess?"" His voice softened, his usual bluster dimming to genuine concern. Marion sighed, a small smile tugging at her lips. ""I'm managing, Coryston. It's not easy, but—"" ""But you're tough,"" Coryston finished for her, his own smile returning"	1913	1983.8549

"I picked him up and stood him on his feet again. ' Hi, little man!' I remember saying, and thinking what a fine little fellow he was. "" And into the ward room, and everybody in the ward room that wasn't occupied with his own was smiling and pointing a finger to where, in the door of my state room, Doris was waiting for me. And I dove through the bulkhead door, leapt the length of the wardroom country, and took her in my arms. For a minute, ten minutes, a half hour — just how long I don't know — I held her and patted her and dried her tears. '""And didn't you bring little Dick?' I asked at last. ""' Why, that was Dick you stood on his feet in the passageway, ' she said, and laughed to think I didn't know him. '"	I was stunned for a moment, realizing that the lively little chap I had just helped was my own son. How he had grown! The last time I had seen him, he had been just a baby, barely toddling around. Now here he was, a sturdy little boy, walking confidently and with such spirit. I felt a pang of guilt for not recognizing him immediately and a sudden sadness for all the moments I had missed. But then, looking into Doris' smiling face, seeing her eyes sparkle with mirth and love, any regret was washed away by the tide of joy that came from being reunited with my family. I scooped Dick up in my arms, this time with recognition and a burst of affection. He laughed, a clear, happy sound that filled the room, and I promised myself that I would not miss another moment of his or Doris' life. We spent the rest of the day together, talking, laughing, and catching up on all the little details of life that I had missed. Doris told me about Dick's first words, his first steps,	1913	1962.0287
The estimates could not be exceeded without good reason, and the necessary economies of the Admiralty had left no margin for unexpected expenses. Even the commissioning of the reserve ships, he was told, was not to be considered in any sense as pointing to the imminence of war ; it was merely a test of the readiness of the fleet. This remarkable dispatch and the series of telegrams which accompanied it were produced at the Parliamentary investigation after the war, and caused simple stupefaction. There was not a hint in them of the peril which menaced the North Sea Fleet. Not the safety of England, but the feelings of the enemy, were considered.	The public, upon learning of this through the newspapers and official reports, was outraged. How could the Admiralty, tasked with the solemn duty of protecting the nation, prioritize diplomatic sensitivities over the clear and present dangers that loomed? Questions were raised in the House of Commons, with fiery debates ensuing about the adequacy of Britain's naval preparedness. The opposition leaders accused the government of gross negligence, while the Admiralty defended its actions, insisting that all measures were taken with the utmost consideration for national security. The inquiry further revealed a series of miscommunications and bureaucratic entanglements that had plagued the Admiralty's decisions. It was disclosed that several crucial reports detailing the increasing threat from enemy naval movements had been downplayed or ignored altogether. The testimony of naval officers painted a picture of an organization struggling under the weight of outdated protocols and overly cautious diplomacy. As the investigation unfolded, the press had a field day. Editorials lambasted the government for what was seen as a dereliction of duty. The image of the Admiralty as an infallible guardian of the seas was tarnished	1906	1931.2662
In the sixth century another method had risen into favour, in which the hand was raised to the forehead, then drawn down to the heart, then to the left shoulder, then to the right * These were the two chief methods — the small cross and the large cross — and there were in the making of the latter a variety of methods of holding the fingers, with a corresponding variety of significations. Both the small and the large cross were known in Anglo-Saxon England. In the Egbert Pontifical the sign is referred to as made cum polliceor cum digito* Alcuin, in speaking of the celebration of the Mass, evidently has the cross in mind Boniface says: ' Habete Christum in cord, et signum sanctae crucis in front, '' and there are many other references to this small cross upon the brow. According to William of Malmesbury's account of the Life of St Dunstan, this usage persisted in his day; for, as the saint beheld Edgitha making the sign frequently upon her brow, he cried, ' May that hand never decay!' And it was proved 1 Kraus, Realencyl. Christ. Alt. p. p. 252. * ibid. * Egbert, Pontif., pp.	119-120. * Alcuin, De Divinis Officiis, cap. XXIV. The practice of making the sign of the cross in this manner was deeply rooted in the devotional lives of the faithful during these times. It was seen not only as a gesture of reverence and a protective emblem but also as an act of remembrance of Christ’s sacrifice and a symbol of the believer's sanctification through His sufferings. This tradition was especially prominent during liturgical ceremonies and times of private prayer, serving as a physical manifestation of faith and a call for divine presence. Moreover, the variation in the manner of making the cross, whether with the thumb or with a specific finger, often bore additional symbolic meanings. Certain theological interpretations suggested that using the thumb represented Christ's humanity, while the index finger symbolized His divinity. This distinction underscored the dual nature of Christ, further enriching the spiritual significance of the act. The practice was also infused with a communal aspect, as noted in various ecclesiastical writings and hagiographies. It served to unify the congregation in a	1904	1916.4028
"This is but the beginning of adventures. How Corley goes to the Devil's Mill, where he is involved in a weird love tragedy, in which the old Mill plays a part, and how he meets Mary Court leigh, whom he ultimately marries, we must leave the story to unfold. The New Wood Nymph. DOROTHEA BUSSELL In this work the author sets forth something of the dangers and problems which confront a girl whose senses and intellect are both keenly awake. To her the beauty of the forest speaks insistently, and with it she comes to identify her life. She meets with adventures and love interests, and goes to London, but the forest is always with her, and when the climax comes she finds the answer to perplexities therein. A Modern flhab. THEODORA WILSON WILSON Author of "" Bess of Hardeadale, "" "" Moll o' the Tollbar, "" etc."	"In ""A Modern Ishab,"" Theodora Wilson Wilson weaves a compelling narrative about a man out of step with the world around him. Ishab, the protagonist, is a man of strong convictions and singular focus, much like the biblical figure he is named after. Living in a small coastal town, he is consumed by a quest that others deem madness: to revive the ancient crafts of shipbuilding using only traditional methods. His obsession alienates him from the modern world and even from his own family, yet it also draws to him a motley crew of supporters who find in him a symbol of purity and dedication in an age of compromise. Through Ishab's journey, Wilson explores themes of tradition versus progress, the value of labor, and the meaning of community. As Ishab struggles against both natural elements and societal pressures, readers are treated to a rich tapestry of characters, each uniquely affected by Ishab's dream. From the skeptical townsfolk to the zealous apprentices who join his cause, Wilson paints a vivid portrait of a community at a crossroads, forced to reconcile its past"	1912	2007.8329
"But won't you put on these roses, miss?"" She pointed to the bunch that Lady William had gathered. Marcia pinned them into her belt and stood a moment looking at her reflection in the glass. Not in mere girlish vanity! 385 Something much stronger and profounder entered in. She seemed to be measuring her resources against some hostile force — to be saying to herself: "" Which of us is to yield ?"	"Am I strong enough to conquer?"" The reflection showed a face pale but resolute, eyes that burned with an inner fire, and lips set in a firm line. As she adjusted the roses, her hands were steady, but her thoughts raced. It was more than a mere social gathering she was preparing for; it was a battlefield where words would serve as swords and glances as arrows.  She turned away from the mirror, taking a deep breath to steady her resolve. Marcia knew that the evening ahead would test her in ways she had only imagined before. The roses, now part of her attire, seemed to her like armor, a small token of natural beauty to shield her against the onslaught of societal expectations and personal challenges. As she left her room, the scent of the roses clung to her, a constant reminder of the garden's tranquility amidst the turmoil that awaited."	1913	1973.8883

(4) New Mexico placed initiative and referendum in constitution to be submitted to popular vote. 1911 to April 1 (1) People of Arizona voted approval of constitution containing provisions for initiative, referendum and recall. (2) People of New Mexico voted approval of constitution containing provisions for initiative and referendum. (3) California legislature voted to sub  Direct Legislation 283 mit initiative, referendum and recall amendments. What is the Initiative and Referendum? From Unity of Chicago, we quote the following : ""What is the initiative and referendum? ""First, the initiative is a method whereby the voters may enact needed legislation if the legislature for any reason refuses to give the people the laws they require. A proposed law presented to the voters and receiving a majority vote becomes a law in spite of the legislature."	Second, the referendum is a process that allows the electorate to approve or reject laws passed by their legislature. It is a form of direct democracy that empowers voters by giving them a final say over specific legislative acts. Essentially, it acts as a check on the powers of the legislature, ensuring that the will of the people is respected. The combination of initiative and referendum mechanisms ensures that the democratic process is not solely in the hands of elected representatives but also remains directly accessible to the voters themselves. This dual approach helps maintain a balance of power between the government and the governed, fostering a more engaged and responsive political environment. Furthermore, the recall feature, which is included in some states like California, allows voters to remove elected officials from office before the end of their term. This is typically initiated by a petition and, if sufficient support is gathered, leads to a new election where constituents can affirm or withdraw their support from the official in question. These tools of direct democracy—initiative, referendum, and recall—equip voters with substantial control over their laws and lawmakers, making government more accountable and reflective of the	1911	1994.4674
Also doctors whose practice along special lines or whose general practice has given them little or no time to make a study of the disease in question and the proper method of administering the new remedy might bungle, where a thoroughly competent physician, provided one accepts the hypothesis of the regular profession, might succeed. Hence, if the people wish to try the new treatment it is clearly to their interest to know where they can receive the treatment from physicians thoroughly competent, judging by the regular medical standards. Now Dr. Galvin's offence lay in his publishing a paid advertisement in two Boston papers and in a theatre programme, stating that he was prepared to treat sufferers with the new and, by the regular medical school, approved, method of treatment.	This act, while seemingly innocuous, was in direct violation of the ethical standards set by the medical community at the time. The medical profession held—and largely still holds—that self-promotion through advertising, particularly in the case of specific treatments, undermines the trust and integrity essential to the doctor-patient relationship. It was argued that such advertisements could potentially exploit the vulnerable by offering them unsubstantiated hope, especially when related to new and not yet widely endorsed treatments. Dr. Galvin's advertisement was deemed especially egregious because it not only promoted a specific medical treatment but also implied a level of endorsement from the regular medical establishment that had not been officially granted. The controversy surrounding his actions sparked a broader debate on the role of advertising in medicine and the responsibilities of physicians to maintain a standard of conduct that prioritizes patient welfare over personal gain. The medical community was concerned that without strict controls, the practice of medicine could become commercialized, leading to a scenario where treatments were pushed on patients not based on medical necessity but on profit motives. This could lead to a dilution of professional standards and potentially harm patients who	1911	2007.1655
The second stage can hardly retain the name metaphysical •- as we are not prepared to debar metaphysical questions from the field of positive science. Looking at its method, we may perhaps call it the stage of dialectic, and we find its characteristic weaknesses underlying the two otherwise opposed methods of metaphysical idealism on the one side, and mechanical materialism on the other. For the third stage we keep the name of positive and adhere to Comte's primary definition of its object as a co ordination of experience, but without allowing as an axiom the contrast between phenomena and reality, or the resolution of all the structure of experience into relations of similitude and succession. Taking the process as a whole, I would divide it fundamentally into two parts, each admitting of subdivisions. The first of these sees the evolution of the definite universal, the second its critical reconstruction.	The development of the definite universal involves the abstraction and formulation of general principles that transcend individual instances, yet are derived from them. This stage is marked by the synthesis of empirical data into broader theoretical frameworks that seek to explain and predict phenomena. It is here that the dialectic process plays a crucial role, as it refines and challenges existing theories, leading to more robust and comprehensive understandings. The critical reconstruction, on the other hand, scrutinizes these universals, questioning their validity, scope, and applicability. This part of the process demands rigorous testing of the theories against new or more extensive data sets, and often leads to revisions or even the discarding of some aspects of the earlier conclusions. It also involves the examination of the assumptions underlying the theories, as well as their implications for further research and practical application. Thus, while the metaphysical stage seeks to establish broad, often speculative, concepts, the dialectic stage refines these into more precise theories through debate and analysis. The positive stage, then, tests and adjusts these theories in light of continuous empirical observation, aiming for a dynamic and	1908	2000.5719
"But though ""the genteel"" refrained from using it, men of sense did not. In consequence it steadily made its way. Finally its American origin was largely forgotten; and the verb has now become quite respectable. There is a third characteristic of language which remains to be considered in connexion with the formation of Americanisms. This is that language will not forever continue to use a circumlocution or a phrase when a simple word can be made to serve as a satisfactory substitute. This is an ever active principle in the development of speech. It causes the adoption of forms which have constantly aimed at brevity  139 of expression. Whenever a single verb offers itself as a substitute for a phrase containing two or three words, it is fairly sure to be accepted in the end. It may not drive out its predecessor."	But it will certainly find its own place and function within the language. The history of English, both in Britain and America, is replete with such examples, where the economy of expression has driven linguistic evolution. In American English particularly, the tendency towards simplification and directness is evident in numerous instances. This practicality in linguistic style is not only a reflection of the American spirit but also a contributor to the dynamic and ever-evolving character of the language. Moreover, this principle of linguistic economy is not confined merely to the adoption of shorter words or phrases. It also manifests in the morphological changes—such as the dropping of redundant suffixes or prefixes—and syntactical shifts that make the language more efficient. The American penchant for getting to the point quickly is mirrored in these linguistic adjustments, making the language not just a tool for communication but also a reflection of cultural values and societal norms. Thus, while some may critique these changes as a degradation of formality or tradition, they are, in fact, a natural evolution towards linguistic efficiency and clarity, driven by the communicative needs and cultural contexts of	1913	1988.5795
The best proof of the injustice of such accusations and attacks lies in the number of American students who still feel attracted by the German academic atmosphere in spite of the wonderful development of American higher institutions of learning. Last winter there were three hundred American students in Ger  man universities, and it must not be forgotten that these young men and women are not undergraduate college students, but that the German university welcomes them only if they can show their college diploma. The German semesters correspond to the study in the post graduate departments of the American universities. As Director of the Amerika Institut, I wrote to these three hundred delegates of the new world and asked them with what training they came and for what purpose, whether they felt satisfied or whether they found anything of which to complain, what they were doing and what they were intending to do, and what they could suggest. The answers display an interesting variety.	Many responded with enthusiasm about the depth and rigor of their studies, appreciating the specialized knowledge and the opportunity to work under some of the most respected scholars in their fields. They spoke of the comprehensive libraries and research facilities that were at their disposal, a far cry from the more limited resources some had access to at home. However, there were also notes of challenge and adaptation. The language barrier, while initially daunting for some, was gradually overcome through immersion and dedicated study, which in itself became a valued part of their educational experience. A significant number mentioned the difference in academic culture. German universities, with their emphasis on independence and self-directed study, required a period of adjustment for those accustomed to the more structured, guided learning environments in the U.S. This independence, though challenging, was ultimately seen as beneficial, fostering a greater sense of personal responsibility and intellectual maturity. Socially, the experience was equally mixed. Some found it easy to integrate and made lasting friendships, while others felt a sense of isolation, attributed to both cultural differences and the transient nature of a student's life abroad. Regarding improvements,	1911	1982.5027
If, then, we announce our standard, we automatically create our class in regard to worth in Being. Are we prepared to state a standard ? We are, but whether the ambiguous; use of terms will tend to confuse what is implied by it remains to be seen. Meaning by passion that expansion of Being which we endeavoured to portray in our last article, we should state our standard in terms of a man's capacity for passion. It is, in reality, a standard in terms of soul measurement. Such passion embodies will, for will, in passion, is a hardworking servant, and not a master. The master element is the desire of the soul, which is passion. So, too, are mentality and culture — excellent servants to passion if they are available, but to be dispensed with, without essential loss, if unavailable.	Passion, then, is the true gauge of a man's worth, for it is the fervor of the soul that determines the breadth and depth of one's engagement with life. This is not to suggest that every passionate endeavor must be grandiose or monumental. Rather, it is the intensity and purity of the passion that matters, whether it be in art, science, commerce, or simple daily tasks. It is passion that animates the soul and infuses life with meaning and purpose, transforming mundane activities into profound expressions of human spirit. Thus, to measure a man by his capacity for passion is to assess his potential for true greatness. This is not measured by the accumulation of wealth or accolades, but by the depth of his engagement with life, the extent to which he has harnessed his innermost desires to forge a path that is uniquely his own. It is through passion that an individual transcends the ordinary, reaching towards the sublime, and in doing so, elevates not only himself but also those around him. Hence, our standard should not be confused with mere	1911	1910.1886

"The Bank Charter was suspended, and the banks had closed with one accord. Upon the "" flags"" the cotton brokers were shouting excitedly, and many a ruined man knew that that would be his last appearance there. Every moment over the telephones came news from Manchester, each record more disastrous than the last. Hot, perspiring men 8  who had lived, and lived well, by speculation in cotton for years, surged around the great pediment adorned by its allegorical group of sculpture, and saw each moment their fortunes falling away like ice in the sunshine. Thus trade in Lancashire — cotton, wool, iron, and corn — was, in the course of one single morning, utterly paralysed, all awaiting the decision of Manchester. Thousands were already face to face with financial disaster, even in those first moments of the alarm. The hours passed slowly."	The tension in the air was palpable as men glanced nervously at each other, exchanging rumors and scraps of information, their faces growing longer with each new piece of disastrous news. The streets outside were filled with the clamor of anxious voices, the sound rising and falling like the tide. Inside the trading rooms, the atmosphere was stifling, heavy with the scent of sweat and fear. As the clock ticked inexorably forward, the sense of impending doom deepened. Brokers who had been kings in their own realms now paced like caged animals, phones pressed to ears, voices raised in frantic negotiation. The usual hum of business had transformed into a cacophony of despair. By midday, the situation had grown even graver. The banks, still shuttered, stood like mausoleums to the fortunes they held captive. Families whose livelihoods depended on the day's trading were gathered in small, somber groups, mothers trying to soothe crying children, fathers with faces set in grim lines. In the midst of this chaos, a lone figure stood apart. He	1906	1980.9286

Rowell, the editor of the Fresno Republican and one of the keenest political observers in the newspaper field, recently completed an extended Eastern tour of investigation, and in the course of an illuminating report of the result of his travel he thus refers to Governor Harmon's prospects: ""The Harmon boom has also gone much further than Western impression would credit. Harmon is beating no tom toms, but he has men out on a still hunt, working in a way that bespeaks organisation and money. This is the way to get delegates, if experience counts for anything."	"The Harmon camp is not making much noise, but it is laying its plans deep. It is securing the sort of quiet endorsements that do not make headlines but do persuade delegates. They are courting the influencers, the kind of men who go to the convention not just as figures but as leaders of their local packs, men who carry weight back home."" Rowell continued, detailing the strategic positions being taken up by Harmon's team in key states, ""In some of the pivotal Eastern and Midwestern states, Harmon's men are becoming quite ubiquitous at local gatherings, making sure that the governor's record and stances are well understood and appreciated. They are not so much pushing as positioning, embedding themselves into the fabric of local political discourse."" This methodical approach, Rowell suggested, was a contrast to some of the more flamboyant campaigns which, while capturing more immediate public attention, might not be building the same level of deep, structural support that could prove crucial in a contested convention. ""Harmon's strategy,"" Rowell concluded, ""is reminiscent of the old adage about speaking softly but"	1911	1997.9786
On the other hand, the spectrophotometer is an elaborate and relatively expensive form of apparatus and needs skilful handling. It is also occasionally not very easily applied to the analysis of coloured fabrics owing to the fact that the amount of light reflected from some dark materials is so small. Dr. Voege has therefore adopted a somewhat simpler device. This consists in merely making an ordinary photometric comparison but observing the field in the photometer through a series of coloured glasses corresponding with the various regions of the spectrum. Presumably, one cannot divide up the spectrum so exactly in this way — it is, for example, notoriously difficult to make a screen which will transmit only the yellow — and the results might therefore only apply to a particular set of glasses. But it is suggested that an approximate idea can readily be gained as to the degree of resemblance of artificial illuminants  EDITORIAL. 371 to daylight, and Dr. Voege has tabulated an unusually complete series of results obtained by this means.	The method, though less precise than using a spectrophotometer, offers a practical alternative for those working in conditions where either the expense or complexity of more sophisticated equipment is prohibitive. Dr. Voege's approach, while inherently limited by the spectral range of the glasses used, provides a valuable comparative analysis in situations where relative, rather than absolute, measurements suffice. By employing a set of standardized colored glasses, the process becomes reproducible and offers the advantage of being more accessible to a wider range of laboratories and research environments. Further advantages include the speed and simplicity of the setup, allowing for quick assessments that are particularly useful in quality control scenarios or preliminary research stages where numerous samples need to be screened rapidly. Moreover, this approach can be adapted to different types of photometers, enhancing its flexibility. Future improvements might involve the development of a more comprehensive set of colored filters, each representing narrower bands of the spectrum to increase the resolution of the measurements. Additionally, incorporating digital image analysis could automate the comparison process, leading to more consistent results and reducing the subjective element inherent in visual assessments.  Overall,	1912	1993.2701
Unconscious hypocrisy, or cynical identification with their natural instincts; nothing else seems possible for woman. But it is neither agreement nor disagreement with, but rather the denial and overcoming of her womanishness that a woman should aim at. If a woman really were to wish, for instance, for man's chastity, it would mean that she had conquered the woman in her, it would mean that pairing was no longer of supreme importance to her and that her aim was no longer to further it.	Such a transformation would signify a profound reorientation of her values and goals, a shift from the biological imperative to a self-determined ethical stance. It would mark the emergence of a woman who does not define herself solely through her relationships or her ability to attract and hold a man, but rather through her own intrinsic qualities and achievements. This would be a woman who seeks not just to fulfill but to transcend the traditional roles prescribed by society. In this new paradigm, the virtues she would admire and strive for would not be those that serve to perpetuate her role within the sphere of reproduction and domesticity, but those which affirm her individuality and her capacity for intellectual and moral growth. Courage, wisdom, integrity, and independence would replace passivity, compliance, and reliance. She would no longer be the mirror reflecting man’s desires and fears but a self-sufficient entity, engaging with the world on her own terms. This is not to say that love or companionship should be forsaken, but that these should not be the sole or ultimate aim of a woman's existence. They should come as part	1911	2007.1993
"Meanwhile, from all the boats strung out along the beach, from Sheringham right across to the Rocket House at Salthouse, swarms of drab coated soldiers were disembarking, the boats immediately returning to the steamers for more. They must have been packed as tightly as herrings in a barrel ; but they all seemed to know where to go to, because all along at various places little flags were held by men, and each regiment appeared to march across and assemble at its own flag. "" Ted and I sat there as if we were watching a play. Suddenly we saw from some of the ships and bigger barges, horses being lowered into the water and allowed to swim ashore. Hundreds seemed to gain the beach even as we were looking at them."	The sight was astonishing—horses flailing in the surf, soldiers guiding them from small boats, or wading into the water to grasp the reins and lead them to safety. The animals, once reaching the sands, shook themselves vigorously, sending arcs of water glistening in the morning sun. The beach was soon a cacophony of shouts, the clatter of hooves, and the continual splash of the next arrivals. Near the water's edge, where the sand was damp and firm, the soldiers began organizing the horses into makeshift corrals, marked out by ropes and stakes quickly hammered into the ground. The efficiency of the operation was a testament to their training and preparation. Every man seemed to move with a purpose, directed by officers who communicated with shouts and hand signals. Above the beach, the villagers had gathered, watching the spectacle with a mixture of awe and apprehension. The arrival of such a force was a clear indicator of the tensions brewing on the continent. For many, it was the closest the distant drumbeats of war had come to their peaceful shores. As each boat	1906	1935.8806

Continuing with the analysis, at the center of the plate (x = 0, y = 0), the radial stress σ_r can be determined using the symmetry and boundary conditions of the problem. From the equilibrium and compatibility equations, σ_r at the center is equal to σ_θ at the center, hence σ_r = σ_θ = - (3 + v)W/(8π). The maximum stress occurs at the center due to the singularity of the loading and the boundary conditions, and it diminishes towards the edges of the plate. This distribution is critical for understanding failure mechanisms in circular plates under uniform loads, particularly in the context of material strength and plate thickness.

We have just seen that different portions of these waves may be tested by the thermometer (or by its more delicate counterpart, the bolometer), by the eye with or without the aid of the spectroscope, and by the photographic plate. But there is a joint effect of the waves of radiant energy which may be interpreted in terms neither of heat, light, nor photographic effect, but in terms of physical pressure. The exquisitely delicate instrument which measures this effect is called the radiometer. It was devised by two American physicists, Professors E. F. Nichols and (i. F. Hull, and it is in effect a more delicate modification of an apparatus first made by the English physicist Sir William Crookes. The little instrument demonstrates that the waves in the aether which are interpreted as heat or light or electro magnetism, and which are rushing through space at the speed of 18fi,000 miles per second, wash against any object that lies in their path with an actual pressure — manifesting themselves as a positive push, in addition to their other effects.	This revelation of the physical pressure exerted by light waves adds a fascinating dimension to our understanding of radiant energy. The radiometer, consisting of an evacuated glass bulb within which are suspended lightweight vanes that are blackened on one side and reflective on the other, rotates when exposed to light due to the differential warming of the vanes. The blackened sides absorb more energy, causing the air molecules on that side to kick back harder than those on the cooler, reflective sides, thus creating movement. The implications of this discovery are profound, not only deepening our grasp of the fundamental properties of light, but also opening potential avenues for the application of light pressure in technologies, such as solar sails for spacecraft. These sails, much like the wind sails on a boat, could theoretically be propelled through space by the pressure of sunlight alone, without the need for conventional fuel. Moreover, the concept of light exerting physical force challenges and expands our traditional perceptions of energy and motion. It invites us to reconsider how we might harness and manipulate these waves not just for their energy or visual capabilities but as a means of	1913	2003.8884
It opens the soil up so that the air can get in and assist in the development of the plant food locked up in an insoluble form. This is an important function of tillage. The soil should be regarded as a great laboratory in which many complex organic and inorganic changes are continually taking place. Humus is the decayed organic matter found in soils. It much resembles common charcoal in its physical properties, has great affinity for water and holds fertilising agents in the soil. Humus makes the soil porous so that the air can readily penetrate it and also assists in chemical changes. Since it keeps the soil porous it prevents it from baking hard, thus protecting it from drought.	Furthermore, humus acts as a sponge, absorbing and retaining moisture which can be released slowly over time, providing a consistent source of water to plants. This ability to retain moisture is particularly crucial during periods of low rainfall, making humus-rich soils invaluable in arid regions. In addition to its water-retaining properties, humus is also a key player in the nutrient cycle within the soil. It binds with nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, preventing them from being washed away by rain or irrigation. Instead, these nutrients are slowly released, becoming available to plants as needed. The presence of humus also encourages the proliferation of beneficial microorganisms in the soil. These microorganisms play a critical role in breaking down organic matter, further enriching the soil with nutrients. They also help in aerating the soil, breaking down toxins, and suppressing disease-causing pathogens.  By enhancing the overall structure of the soil, humus contributes to better root development. Roots can penetrate more deeply and extensively into humus-rich soil, providing better anchorage and access to nutrients. This results in	1914	2007.0952
(4) That small units of light are in general to be preferred. (5) Indirect lighting should only be used for general lighting, or as supplementary to the necessaty local illumination. I do not propose to enter into the Fm. in. — Lighting of Hall 1 know of nothing more uncomfortable than a room equally illuminated on every square foot of the floor, and a room so lighted is, in my opinion, inartistic. I suggest the following rules for illuminating the home : — (1) That a room should not be evenly illuminated. (2) The filament of the lamp should be so placed as not to be in the line of vision under normal conditions. questions of the dimensions and positions of windows, the colours of papers, paints, or ceilings, cas these are items which do not as yet strictly fall within the scope of the contractor dealing with the artificial illumination of the house.	(3) Use of shades and reflectors should be made to control the direction and spread of light, enhancing both comfort and aesthetic appeal. (4) The lighting should complement the room’s purpose; brighter lights in reading areas or workspaces, softer lights in relaxation areas. (5) Attention should be given to the color temperature of the bulbs used; warmer tones for living rooms and bedrooms, cooler tones for bathrooms and kitchens to match the activities typically performed in these spaces. (6) Consideration should be given to the placement of switches for convenience as well as the ability to control different sections of lighting independently, allowing for flexibility in the use of space according to varying needs and times of day. (7) Where possible, incorporate natural light sources with artificial lighting to create a balanced, harmonious environment. This can be achieved through the strategic placement of lamps and fixtures in relation to windows. (8) For aesthetic enhancement, feature lighting such as spotlights or track lighting can be used to highlight artworks, bookcases, or architectural details within the home.

Deimos, being only 10 miles in diameter and about 12,500 miles from the surface of the planet, does not give rise to so many phenomena as the nearer satellite: still they are very numerous. It revolves round the planet in 30^ hours, but appears to take 131^ hours to do so, being above the horizon about 60 hours, and below it nearly 72 hours. These are the times as seen from the equator ; but, as in the case of Phobos, the farther the place is from the equator the shorter is the period that Deimos is seen above the horizon, until, when latitude 82° is reached in either hemisphere, it ceases to become visible at all. Our moon, being so very much more distant from our earth, could be seen from both the poles. Deimos also passes nearly twice through all its phases whilst it is above the horizon, viz.	from a slender crescent to full, and back again to a crescent. This rapid phasing is due to its swift 30.3-hour orbit around Mars, which contrasts sharply with our own moon's slower 27.3-day cycle. Observers on Mars would note that Deimos rises in the east and sets in the west, much like celestial bodies observed from Earth, although its motion across the Martian sky is significantly faster. The visibility of Deimos also varies depending on the observer’s location on Mars. Near the Martian equator, Deimos appears to move relatively slowly across the sky, allowing for longer observations. However, as one moves towards higher latitudes, the visibility duration of Deimos decreases significantly. This peculiar visibility pattern is due to the inclination of Deimos' orbit relative to Mars' equator, coupled with the curvature of the planet itself. Additionally, because Deimos orbits Mars close to the equatorial plane, solar and lunar eclipses occur with Deimos more frequently than with Phobos, though they are less dramatic given Deimos' smaller size. These eclips	1911	1995.6346
"Our vegetation, too, has adapted itself to the conditions of the planet in the course of the changes which have taken place during past ages, and now requires very little water or moisture to maintain it in vigorous and healthy growth."" One more question was put to him by John, who asked, "" Do these canals constitute your whole 200  supply of water for drinking, as well as for all other purposes ? "" "" Oh no, John ! "" exclaimed Merna. "" We draw all our pure water from deep wells."	"These wells tap into subterranean reservoirs that are replenished by underground streams originating from the ice caps at the poles. The canals primarily aid in agriculture and the distribution of this water to distant communities across our lands."" John, intrigued by this efficient use of natural resources, continued his inquiry. ""And how do you manage to keep these wells and canals functioning in such harsh conditions?"" Merna smiled, ""Our ancestors developed a system of maintenance that has been refined over generations. We use solar-powered pumps to extract the water from deep beneath the surface, and the canals are lined with a durable material that minimizes evaporation and withstands the planet’s temperature extremes."" ""Moreover,"" Merna added, ""we have a network of sensors and automated gates that control the flow of water based on demand and weather conditions. This ensures that every area receives an adequate supply without wastage."" John nodded, impressed by the sophistication of the Martian water management system. It was a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of Merna’s people, adapting their technology and lifestyle to thrive in an environment"	1911	1988.6154
Front of head, cheeks and mid line of the back smooth; about 4 irregular lines of large tubercles on the back; a thick tubercular ridge of a yellow colour separating the back from the side; sides and belly and under surfaces of limbs granulated. Colour: Brilliant pea green above and purplish below; longitudinal bands of golden yellow on the back. A black dorso lateral line. Limbs green and yellow mottled above, the legs of a bluer green; hind part of thighs and legs rusty orange. (After mccoy.) These are the typical colours of this frog in the active season, but it shows the most remarkable power of accommodating its colour to its surroundings.	During the inactive season or when threatened, it can transform its radiant greens and yellows to a more subdued brown or grey to blend seamlessly with the bark and leaves of its environment. This adaptive coloration serves as a vital defense mechanism against predators, allowing the frog to remain nearly invisible within its natural habitat. The ability to change color also assists in temperature regulation, helping the frog to absorb or reflect heat as necessary. The dorsal surface of this frog is not only visually striking but also textured with purpose. The large tubercles provide some protection against smaller predators and may play a role in mating rituals, as they could be used to impress potential mates or intimidate rivals. Meanwhile, the granulated texture on the belly and under the limbs helps the frog to grip wet surfaces, facilitating movement through its arboreal territory. This species' vibrant coloration and dynamic texturing are not just adaptations for survival but are also key indicators of the frog's health and vitality. A bright, well-defined pattern is often a sign of a healthy frog, while dull or mottled colors can indicate stress or illness. As	1909	2007.6482
at first; and that I read in your Companion of the Playhouse. We said that that piece furnished a new proof of the difference between your stage and ours ; and that is simple enough, for a French play, composed and written in such a style, would not have been listened to on our stage as far as the second act. . . . Moreover, we took good care not to compare Howe to Shakespeare. The latter's monsters are of quite another kind. Pardon me if I speak thus of your divinity ; but, after all, why conceal one's opinion of poets who are no more ?	It is not that we deny the genius of Shakespeare; on the contrary, his vast imagination and deep insight into human nature command our highest admiration. But we must also recognize that his works, resplendent with a kind of wild and untamed beauty, often diverge from the classical unities and decorum that our French stage holds dear. His characters, larger than life, sometimes border on the fantastical, a stark contrast to the measured and moralistic figures that populate our plays. Our dramas strive for a certain purity of form, a meticulous balance of elements that we believe nurtures both the intellect and the moral sense of our audience. The French stage is a temple of order and reason, where each word, each action is carefully weighed and considered for its ethical and aesthetic impact. In this environment, the tumultuous passions and sprawling narratives of Shakespeare can seem overwhelming, even chaotic. Thus, while we marvel at the scope of Shakespeare's vision, we cannot help but feel that his plays, in their original form, might disrupt the delicate harmony we seek to cultivate in our theatrical presentations. This	1912	1962.1858
What appears merely mechanical, the result of several methods of voting or transit or finance, is fundamentally after all but the external form that some definite mental purpose has taken. The form is only the index of continual synthetic growth. Every new function that the city developes and, on trial, sustains, is but the sign of newly elaborated structures. And as the individuals whose massed activities have generated the great city all pass away, we are continually obsessed with the illusion that the city has come from some other than a personal source. Is there anything in the functions of the city to check this obsession ? I think there is.	The very complexity of the city's functions, the intricate web of its administrative duties and the myriad personal interactions that sustain its daily life, all point to a deeply human origin. The city's growth, its adaptations and innovations, are not merely technical achievements but are also expressions of collective human will and creativity. Each street laid, each building erected, and each policy enacted are embodiments of myriad decisions, desires, and compromises of its inhabitants. Moreover, the city is not a static entity; it is dynamically evolving, reacting to the needs and pressures of its population. This continuous adaptation and evolution are indicative of a living organism, one that is driven by the collective psyche of its people. It is in the public squares, in the bustling markets, and in the quiet moments of community gatherings that one can see the city’s true nature as an extension of human interaction and communal spirit. Thus, the city, in its form and function, serves as a constant reminder of the human energies that have shaped it. It stands as a testament to human ingenuity and the capacity for cooperation. The city's ongoing development	1908	1992.6951
"All except Hart were still in doubt of the authenticity of the letter; but he was so intoxicated with the notion of its value as a political sensation, and was withal so much a man of impulse, that he knew neither doubt nor caution. No one of us suspected a forgery to deceive the public or injure Garfield; but there were fears of a practical joke that might make the paper ridiculous — an experience it had barely escaped within six months. To appreciate our dilemma fully, it must be understood that Garfield's handwriting was not well known ; that the immediate means of the paper for making secret inquiries were too limited to be useful; and that any unguarded attempt to verify the authenticity of the letter would be almost certain to result, if the letter were really genuine, in its appropriation by another paper and the loss to Truth of a ""beat"" or ""scoop"" of the first magnitude."	"Thus, we were ensnared in a web of uncertainty and risk. Hart, ever the gambler in matters journalistic, was prepared to run the gauntlet, arguing that the potential gains far outweighed the risks.

Continuing with the analysis, the bending moment, Mx, at the center can be derived from the stress distribution. Given that the moment is related to the stress by the equation M = σy (where σ is the stress and y is the distance from the neutral axis, which in this case is the thickness /2 of the plate), we find that: Mx = px * (/2) = (± 3Vf / 4r) * (/2) = ± 3Vf / 8r. This bending moment helps us understand the plate’s resistance against bending under the applied load.

This discrepancy in the dates has led to much confusion among those studying Garrick's early career and personal life. It is crucial to note that Mrs. Garrick actually passed away several years prior to her husband, allowing David Garrick the emotional freedom to pursue his theatrical ambitions without the fear of causing her distress. This correction in the timeline not only clarifies the sequence of events but also highlights the profound influence his mother's memory had on Garrick’s decisions and his subsequent rise in the theatre world. Further research into parish records and contemporary accounts would likely shed more light on the exact dates and help reconcile the various accounts provided by Garrick's biographers. Such investigations are essential for a more accurate understanding of the personal motivations and background influences that shaped the careers of historical figures like David Garrick. Moreover, understanding the context of his mother's death provides deeper insight into Garrick's character and the sentimental ties that governed his early years in the theatre.	1912	2005.95

Azelaic acid was obtained in sufficient quantity to account for half the molecule of both modifications, and in addition to this among the oxidation products malonic acid and propionic aldehyde were identified. The final elucidation of the constitution of these acids must, therefore, be left for the future. Hazura and Hehner and Mitchell also recovered the acid from the hexabromide by reduction with zinc and alcoholic hydrochloric acid, and found that it absorbed not far short of the theoretical amount of iodine (iodine value, 241-8 and 245). Hazura prepared another derivative by oxidising the acids from linseed oil with permanganate in the cold. Two hexahydroxy stearic acids were obtained, linusic and isolinusic acids. These acids are more soluble in water than sativic or tetrahydroxystearic acid, less soluble in alcohol and insoluble in aether. Linusic acid crystallises in rhombic plates or in needles, with the melting point 203° to 205°.	Isolinusic acid, on the other hand, forms prismatic crystals which melt at a slightly higher temperature of 208° to 210°. The specific rotations of these acids were also determined, with linusic acid showing a rotation of +49.2° and isolinusic acid displaying a slightly lower rotation of +47.5°. These differences in physical properties suggest subtle variations in their molecular structures, which could potentially impact their biological activities and industrial applications. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the stereochemistry of these compounds and the implications of their structural differences. It is also of interest to explore the enzymatic pathways involved in their formation and breakdown within biological systems, as these pathways could reveal new targets for drug development or new methods for the biotechnological production of useful derivatives. Moreover, the reactivity of these hexahydroxy stearic acids with various chemical agents could open up new avenues for synthesizing novel compounds with enhanced functionalities. For instance, their potential to form esters, amides, or other derivatives could be exploited in creating new materials with specific properties such as	1913	2001.2421
"Each battery of reflectors (there are eight altogether, containing thirty Mazda lamps) is so disposed as to concentrate the light in the required direction.

The minimum vertical illumination is 1J foot candles, and. of course, this varies according to the proximity of the lights. Figs. 1 and 2 are reproductions of untouched night photographs of the chancel and sanctuary of St. Mary's Church. Fig. 1 gives a general view of the chancel, and three outstanding qualities will be noted in the method of lighting employed. It gives practically a uniform illumination, it renders FIG."	2 a more detailed view of the sanctuary, highlighting the intricate carvings and the rich textures of the altar cloths and vestments. This attention to detail ensures that each element within the sanctuary is distinctly visible, enhancing the overall aesthetic and spiritual experience. The lighting technique avoids harsh shadows and the blending of light ensures that the figures of the saints and other iconography are presented in a reverential and dignified manner. This system of lighting also benefits the congregation by creating an atmosphere of calm and reverence, suitable for contemplation and prayer. The soft glow emanates warmth and invites the faithful to focus on the spiritual aspects of the service. Moreover, the careful placement of each lamp and reflector not only preserves the sanctity of the church’s architectural features but also protects the integrity of its historical elements, ensuring that they are neither overly illuminated nor left in shadow. Through these methods, the lighting design at St. Mary's Church not only fulfills practical needs but also enhances the sacredness of the space, proving that thoughtful lighting can profoundly influence the ambiance of a religious setting.	1912	1998.2279

Why, that had not been opened since he had measles long ago and his father had come on one of those rare visits. A LITTLE LEAVEN 667 He heard them read such sentences as, ""You will remember my mother, I am sure; she so often speaks to me of your school girl days together""; and: ""As I am in Boston at present, she is most anxious that I should come out to see you. May I?"" That seemed to be the most important part, for they reread it two or three times."	"Aunt Bella clucked her tongue and fluttered about in a state that mingled anticipation with a dash of anxiety. ""Oh, Clara, what do we do about the spare room? It’s been ages since anyone stayed there. And the dust, you remember the dust!"" Aunt Clara, who had spent most of her life in her sister’s shadow, handling the quieter details of their shared existence, simply nodded. ""I’ll see to it,"" she murmured, almost to herself, as she often did, fading into the background with a sense of duty that was as silent as it was efficient. Aunt Bella, meanwhile, continued to fuss. ""And the linens! We must have fresh linens. And perhaps some of those nice biscuits from the baker, don’t you think? Oh, and flowers! We mustn’t forget flowers."" The letter lay on the lace tablecloth, its words causing ripples in the placid pond of their routine lives. The visitor was evidently the daughter of a dear old school friend, and the reference to their shared past brought a nostalgic"	1913	1997.0065
I have referred to these three forms of Comparative Politics, the statical limited to civilised communities, the first dynamic or affiliative form, and the second dynamic or purely evolutionary form, in order to remind you in a summary way of the contents and range of the science. But it would be inconsistent with past practice, and, much worse than that, a piece of useless pedantry, to insist on the rigid separation of these forms or methods in the practical work of investigation. Take, for instance, such a book as that of Professor John W. Burgess, of Columbia College, on Political Science and Comparative Constitutional Law.	In this work, Professor Burgess adeptly combines all three forms of Comparative Politics, illustrating how they can be interwoven to provide a comprehensive understanding of political systems and their development. He examines the static structure of government in various states, traces their historical affiliations and influences, and explores their evolutionary trajectories in terms of political theory and practice. By doing so, he demonstrates the interdependencies of these forms and the richness that such a multifaceted approach can bring to the understanding of political phenomena. The integration of these methods allows for a deeper insight into how political institutions are shaped by both their historical contexts and their functional necessities. It also highlights the dynamic nature of political systems, how they adapt and evolve over time in response to internal and external pressures. This approach not only enriches the academic study of political science but also enhances the practical application of its principles in addressing contemporary political issues. Thus, while the theoretical distinction among the statical, affiliative, and evolutionary forms serves as a useful framework for organizing political study, the overlap and interaction between these categories are where much of the substantive analysis and valuable	1908	2007.4034
"All human lovfe has in it the genesis of immaterial ideal passion, and from this point of view it is safe to regard it. The unforgivable crime against life is dullness Dullness is synonymous with sin — sin being that which hurts life. To be bored is worse than being wicked. We should endeavour to escape a bore with more determination than any other kind of malefactor. Misdemeanours wound life, dullness kills it; dullness, in fact, is the negation of life; it is death. Of two men living in a monastery, and finding life dull, one acquiescing in the dullness and filling in the time with a round of duties, which he regards in the light merely of "" occupation, "" the other, trying to overcome the dullness by altering it, even by vice, the latter is the higher of the two, and has a better chance of saving his soul alive."	The first man, who merely submits to the monotony, is surrendering to the very essence of lifelessness. He may keep his hands busy and his schedule full, but his spirit is languishing; he is not truly engaging with life, but merely passing through it as an observer, detached and disinterested. On the other hand, the second man, though perhaps misguided in his methods, is actively seeking engagement. He recognizes the stultifying effect of dullness and combats it, striving to inject meaning and vibrancy back into his existence. His spirit is alive, responsive, and in pursuit of something beyond mere existence.  In this context, the pursuit of excitement, even through means that might traditionally be considered morally ambiguous, is elevated to an act of spiritual preservation. It is a testament to the human need for stimulation and a reminder that life, in its most vibrant form, requires not just activity, but heartfelt engagement. The risk of moral falter, while significant, pales in comparison to the existential threat posed by apathy and ennui. The true crime, then,	1911	1929.5417
"If he knows that Christ died for him, that there is a future beyond the grave, it makes all the difference between despair and hope, between misery and consolation, between the helpless frailty of a being that is puffed out like a candle, and the joyful power of an endless life. My brethren, we must work and pray for a true revival of Christian doctrine in our age. We must deepen our own hold upon the truths which Christ has taught us. We must preach them more simply, more confidently, more reasonably, more [""3]  earnestly. We must draw from them the happiness and the help, the comfort and the inspiration, that they have to give to the souls of men. But most of all, we must keep them in close and living touch with the problems of daily duty and experience. For no doctrine, however high, however true, can make men happy until it is translated into life."	It must not remain as a mere abstraction, a lofty ideal hovering above us, unreachable and impractical. Instead, it must permeate our actions, guide our decisions, and influence our interactions with others. Christian doctrine should be the lens through which we view the world, transforming our perspective and thereby our lives. We must strive not only to understand these doctrines intellectually but to embody them, to live them out in every moment of our existence. This is the true essence of a revival of Christian doctrine—it is not merely about increased knowledge or fervor in worship. It is about a profound transformation in how we live. It involves a renewal of heart and mind, a deep-seated change that affects every aspect of our being. As we align our lives more closely with the teachings of Christ, we become beacons of light and hope in a world that often seems overshadowed by despair and disillusionment. Therefore, let us not be content with superficial changes. Let us seek a deeper reformation, a thorough renewal of our inner selves. Let us pray for the courage and strength to apply these timeless truths	1908	1997.4393

In the second year these scaffold branches should be cut back to one half or two thirds their length (figs. 13-2a and 14-a). This will cause two or three strong laterals to develop from near the extremity of each stub. With the third season, the laterals which have developed from the previous season's cutting back will again need to be headed in about one half their growth. Shoots which are growing inward, and those tending to cross or rub, should be removed or corrected. The regulation of a shoot is governed by the position on the tree. Note the designated ones and the position of the buds in figure 14, and the suggestions brought out in figure 13, ?	which illustrate the proper pruning techniques to ensure balanced growth and sufficient sunlight exposure for all branches. It is critical to maintain an open center in the tree to allow light to penetrate and air to circulate, promoting healthier fruit and reducing the risk of disease. In subsequent years, continue to monitor the growth and development of the tree, adjusting your pruning strategy accordingly. Always aim to remove any dead, diseased, or damaged wood first. Then, focus on thinning out dense areas where branches are overcrowded, as this can impede the tree's productivity and overall health. As the tree matures, lesser pruning may be required, focusing mainly on maintaining the shape, removing undesirable growth, and ensuring the structural integrity of the tree. Remember, the goal of pruning is not only to shape the tree but to optimize fruit production and ensure the longevity of the tree. Regular observation and timely intervention are key to successful tree management.	1914	2006.8556
Turning after this excursion into other fields of Protozoa, to the  578 case of Paramecium, it will be seen that the conditions are entirely different from those which accompany conjugation in the majority of  Fig. 12 Protozoa. In the latter fertilisation is accomplished by the formation and fusion of gametes or minute simulacra of the adult cells, some being differentiated into microgametes and macrogametes, or male and female. 579 In Paramecium there are no gametes of this kind, but portions of the adult individuals fuse as in Ophryocystis mesnili. Unlike this Gregarine, the fusion of the adult cells is only temporary and the two parties to the conjugation do not die. During the temporary fusion there is a mutual interchange of micronuclei and a mutual fertilisation, while the only portion to disintegrate and die is the macronucleus of each conjugant, and this is replaced by a specially differentiated fragment of the new micronucleus. In ciliated protozoa such as Paramecium and its near relations the germ plasm is concentrated in the micronucleus, while the somatic plasm is represented by the macronucleus. As we have seen, the micronucleus enlarges and divides during conjugation, first into two, then these into four, all but one of the four degenerating.	The surviving micronucleus then undergoes a further division, resulting in the generation of two new micronuclei, one of which will be exchanged between the conjugating paramecia. This process ensures genetic recombination and diversity, which is crucial for the adaptation and survival of the species in changing environments. Post-conjugation, each Paramecium retains one of its original micronuclei and one from its partner, thereby mixing their genetic material. Following this, each Paramecium reconstructs its macronucleus from the new micronuclei, allowing for the expression of newly combined genetic traits. This reconstruction of the macronucleus involves a complex process of DNA replication and possibly even the elimination of certain genes, which modifies the expression profile of the cell to adapt to its current environment. This unique method of sexual reproduction in Paramecium and related ciliates not only highlights the diversity of reproductive strategies in protozoa but also underscores the evolutionary advantage of genetic exchange and recombination. It allows these organisms to maintain genetic variability and adaptability without the need for gametes	1911	2006.7363
Among the latter agreements are those that promote smuggling, evade the internal revenue laws, assist in rebellion or riot, aid enemies of our country, effect fraud in elections, or interfere with legislation or ‘the administration of justice by our courts. Contracts to build ships of war or to manufacture arms or to furnish supplies in violation of the laws and treaties of our country will not be recognised by our courts. 73.	Furthermore, agreements that involve the corruption of public officials, the suppression of evidence, or the subversion of legal processes are equally void and unenforceable. In essence, any contract that contravenes public policy or that requires the performance of an act deemed illegal by the state or federal law is nullified from its inception. This principle ensures that the legal system does not lend its support to activities that would undermine its integrity or the public trust. Contracts that stipulate the commission of a crime, such as bribery or theft, are obvious examples of agreements that cannot be sustained under the law. Similarly, agreements that involve the exploitation of minors, the promotion of illegal drug use, or the violation of safety laws are prohibited. The law aims to protect the welfare of the community and uphold moral and ethical standards through the enforcement of such provisions. It is incumbent upon the courts to scrutinize the purposes and the means stipulated in agreements to ensure they align with legal and ethical norms. This judicial oversight prevents the misuse of contractual freedom to carry out objectives detrimental to societal well-being. Thus, while parties are	1913	1984.6727
It is this which the teacher values most in his old age — independence for himself and for the wife who may survive him. The result of the Carnegie Foundation pensions in this direction has been all that one could wish. No less evident has been the good effect of the foundation pensions  upon the colleges themselves. Where the foundation has enabled a college to retire in a dignified and just way teachers who had worn out their usefulness and where it has enabled colleges to substitute in their place younger men of fresh and alert spirit, the result has been to quicken and vivify the whole intellectual life of the college. Here again is a result whose benefit no one can question.	The infusion of new blood has often brought with it new methods, new enthusiasm, and a new vision that has propelled institutions forward into a more dynamic and progressive era. This rejuvenation not only benefits the students, who receive the most current and engaging instruction, but also invigorates the faculty by fostering an environment of continuous learning and innovation. Moreover, the security provided by these pensions has had a profound impact on the morale of the teaching staff. Knowing that their future is secure, educators are able to devote themselves more fully to the art of teaching, without the distractions of financial concerns that so often plague those in the later years of their careers. This peace of mind enables them to focus on developing more effective teaching strategies and engaging more deeply with their students. In addition, the presence of this pension system acts as a powerful recruitment tool. Top-tier talent, attracted by the promise of long-term security and a supportive environment, is more likely to seek employment at institutions that offer such benefits. This not only raises the standard of education provided but also enhances the reputation of the college, attracting higher quality students and	1911	1987.911
Observations of the illumination showed on the horizontal surfaces of the counter on this side 24 foot candles ; while that on the other side, having no assistance from the low pressure lights, showed 19-2 foot candles.

The marble walls on the left side of the picture showed a surface brightness of 9-3 to 10 foot candles. The illumination is very uniform, and the shop has a pleasant appearance of being very well lighted'. Fig.	10. — Grocery Section of Mr. Charlesworth's Emporium, Leeds. In contrast, the grocery section presented a different lighting scenario. The horizontal surfaces where the bulk of goods were displayed averaged around 21 foot candles, slightly less than the boot store. However, the vertical surfaces of the shelves where spices and canned goods were arranged showed a higher level of illumination, approximately 11-13 foot candles, due to additional spot lighting aimed to enhance the visibility of these products. On the floor, the light levels varied from 8-9 foot candles, providing a more subdued ambiance compared to the brighter display areas. The overall effect was one of focused lighting that highlighted the products on the shelves, while allowing for a slightly darker, more relaxed pathway for customers to shop. This strategic use of lighting not only enhanced the visibility of the merchandise but also created an inviting atmosphere that encouraged browsing and prolonged visits. The marble counters at the service areas gleamed under 12 foot candles of light, ensuring that transactions were conducted with clarity and ease.	1912	1990.6005
"Differences in English and American Usage BY THOMAS R. LOUNSBURY Emeritus Professor of English, Yale University IT has been intimated in a previous article that in the strictest and, it may be added, in the only really proper sense of the term, an Americanism is a word or phrase naturally used by an educated American which under similar conditions would not be used by an educated Englishman. The emphasis, it will be seen, lies on the word "" educated."" To set off the speech of the illiterate American against the speech of the cultivated Englishman is as unscientific as it would be to set off the speech of the London cockney against that of the cultivated American. Comparison of the usage of two different countries can properly be made only between members of the same social class. Furthermore, this definition of Americanism needs another limitation, so far as these particular articles are concerned."	"It should be understood that while certain words and phrases are characterized as Americanisms due to their prevalent use in the United States, they are not necessarily exclusive to American speakers. Indeed, the fluid nature of language and the increasing influence of media and culture mean that many terms originally distinct to American English have permeated other varieties of English. Thus, what may have started as an Americanism could become part of global English usage over time. The differences in usage also extend beyond individual words to include variations in spelling, pronunciation, and grammatical constructions. For instance, Americans generally favor simpler spellings—'color' instead of 'colour', 'theater' instead of 'theatre'. Pronunciation differences are notable as well, such as the American flattening of the 'a' in words like 'path' and 'bath', which contrasts with the broader 'a' sound used by the English.  In terms of grammar, there are several distinctions, such as the American use of the past simple in situations where the British might use the present perfect. Americans might say ""I already ate"", whereas"	1913	2005.3846
"If he does know this, why does he trot out, as evidence in support of his case, that the ""newspapers last year were continually informing us of the pressure of population on food as an explanation of the rise of food prices""? He should know as well as anyone that the Press of today has prostituted itself to the capitalist class, and acts accordingly. I must apologise for occupying so much of your space, which might have been more profitably employed, but I wish it understood that I do not desire to oppose Malthusians or any other body of progressive propagandists, but to cooperate with them. It is desirous, however, that all phases of the subject should be reviewed, and it appeared to me the Malthusians were working in the belief that theirs was the only straight road to Utopia. FRED COLLINS."	Yet, I must assert that the path to any societal Utopia is multifaceted and requires the cooperation and understanding of various ideologies and approaches. The Malthusian perspective, focusing on the pressures of population growth on resources, is indeed valuable. However, it must be integrated with other socio-economic theories and practices to create a balanced and equitable world.  The challenges we face are complex and interconnected, involving not just population and food supply but also issues of distribution, waste, agricultural practices, and the impact of economic systems on resource accessibility. It is imperative that our discourse includes these broader topics to avoid oversimplification and to craft solutions that are comprehensive and sustainable. In collaborating with all progressive groups, including Malthusians, we must strive for a synthesis of ideas that acknowledges the strengths and limitations of each perspective. Only through such holistic consideration can we hope to address the root causes of our challenges and move closer to a just and thriving society for all.	1911	2007.2148
"The radiant honey filled corollas, touching and over lapping, and rising above one another, glowed in the living light like a sunset sky — one sheet of purple and gold, with the bright Sacramento pouring through the midst of it from the north, the San Joaquin from the south, and their many tributaries sweeping in at right angles from the mountains, dividing the plain into sections fringed with trees."" Now that plain is a checkerboard of grain and alfalfa fields bounded by irrigation ditches. And the lesser valleys, parallel with this great central plain, bounded by mountains still more or less timbered, are consecrated to the culture — of prunes. Undisturbed nature is still accessible, nearer at hand in that golden west than in the green middle west or on the Atlantic slope. Even the tourist can reach it if he will; not in Yosemite with its hotel, camps, and mule polluted trails; but beyond, at the top of the world, in the higher places of the Sierra."	Here, the air is sharp and pure, and the sky stretches vast and unobstructed, a deep blue canvas dotted with the white of drifting clouds. The granite peaks rise stark and majestic, their rugged faces telling tales of aeons past. Among these ancient giants, the sequoias stand solemn and grand, their thick bark whispering secrets of millennia in the wind. The high meadows roll gently, dotted with wildflowers that sway in the breeze—lupines, poppies, and the delicate hues of paintbrushes painting the landscape in vibrant strokes. The streams, fed by the melting snows, chatter over stones, their cold, clear waters rushing toward unseen destinations. Lakes sit quietly nestled in basins, their surfaces mirrors reflecting the grandeur of the towering peaks and the endless sky. This is a place where time slows, where the soul can breathe and the mind can wander through the vastness of nature untouched. For those who venture into these higher places, the experience is transformative. The hustle of modern life falls away, replaced by the rhythmic pace of nature.	1911	1983.2767
Material that has been dried with sodium sulphate can be easily pulverised, if it was originally finely minced, even without the use of mechanical mortars. A ball mill worked by a motor is recommended by Voltz. B. THE ESTIMATION OF FAT IN ANIMAL TISSUES. The fat found in those parts of the body where fat is stored, for the use of cells elsewhere rather than in the storage cells themselves, is almost entirely composed of simple glycerol esters of fatty acids easily soluble in aether and slightly in alcohol. The fat found in the cells of the liver and in those of the organs in which fat is oxidised for the liberation of energy is largely composed of complex phospholipines, which present solubilities different from those of the simple fats.	These phospholipids are not only soluble in ether but also exhibit solubility in alcohols, particularly ethanol and methanol, due to their amphipathic nature—possessing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. In the procedure for the estimation of fat in these tissues, it is crucial to select an appropriate solvent or mixture of solvents that can efficiently extract the fat from the biological matrices. Typically, a mixture of chloroform and methanol in the ratio of 2:1 is used, a method derived from the Folch or Bligh and Dyer extraction techniques, which are highly effective in isolating both simple and complex lipids. The sample is homogenized in this solvent mixture, allowing the lipids to dissolve. After the addition of water, the mixture separates into two phases: an upper methanol-water phase and a lower chloroform phase containing the extracted lipids. The lower phase is then collected, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure to yield the lipids. For quantification, the residue can then be	1913	2003.964
"No, nothing except birds and trees, water lilies and such like happenings, ever happens along the old canal; and our nearest to a human event was our meeting with a lonely, melancholy man, sitting near a moss grown waterwheel, smoking a corncob pipe, and gazing wistfully across at the Ramapo Hills, over which great sunlit clouds, were billowing and c' ng slow mov ing shadows. Stopping, we passed him the time of day and inquired when the next barge was due. For answer he took a long draw at his m f&■ corncob, and, taking his eyes for a moment from the landscape, said in a far away manner that it might be due any time now, as the spring had come and gone, and implying, with a sort of sad humour in his eyes, that spring makes all things possible, brings all things back, even an old slowr moving barge along the old canal. ""What do they carry on the canal?"""	"He sighed, the smoke curling up around his face as he contemplated the question. ""Mostly stone from the quarries up north, and sometimes lumber,"" he answered slowly. ""But years ago, it used to be everything—coal, grain, you name it. Those barges were the lifeblood of these parts."" He paused, his gaze drifting back to the hills. ""Not much traffic these days. The railroads and the big trucks on the highways carry most of what used to travel this water."" The man's voice had a nostalgic timbre, evoking images of a bustling canal, filled with barges laden with goods, the air alive with the shouts of men and the creaking of timbers. Now, all that remained was the quiet solitude, the occasional bird call, and the gentle lapping of water against the mossy banks. ""Does the canal ever flood?"" one of us asked, breaking the silence that had resettled over our small group. ""Every few years,"" he replied, tapping his pipe against the heel of his boot to empty it."	1913	1994.7047
Variations, moreover, which were not immediately favourable, would now have a chance of surviving. Looked at in this way multicellularity presents itself as an escape from the rigour of natural selection which for the unicellular organism had narrowed competition to so desperate a struggle that any variation outside the straitest limits was fatal, for even though it might be favourable in one respect it would, in so small a kingdom, involve a loss in another. The only way, therefore, for further advantageous elaboration to occur was by the enlargement of the competing unit. Various species of multicellular organisms might in time be supposed in turn to reach the limit of their powers.	As they approached these limits, internal differentiation and increased complexity became necessary adaptations for survival. The evolution of specialized tissues and organs allowed for more efficient processing of resources, better locomotion, enhanced sensory capabilities, and more sophisticated methods of reproduction. Each of these advancements opened new niches and environments to be exploited, thereby reducing direct competition among individuals of the same species. This process of becoming more complex also facilitated the development of new forms of cooperation among cells and later, among individuals, which could lead to even greater survival advantages. The rise of cooperative behaviors and complex social structures could further mitigate the harshness of natural selection by distributing the risks and benefits of survival across a group rather than an individual alone. Hence, multicellularity did not merely enlarge the physical structure of life forms but also introduced a new level of interaction within the biological framework. This allowed for an intricate dance of competition and cooperation, where the pressures of natural selection continued to drive evolution, but did so across a more complex and interconnected canvas. The emergence of multicellular life was thus a critical step in the evolutionary narrative, paving the way	1908	2001.6245

From a psychological point of view, we emphasised that suggestion is in its last meaning only a particular form of attention. Accordingly, the teacher has not the slightest reason to avoid suggestion. But just because it is a powerful influence, he has the more reason to use it considerately and wisely. He must never forget that any word spoken by him falls on soil prepared to an unusual degree in the suggestible mind of the child. He must, therefore, feel conscious of the deep effect which his praise and his blame, his encouragement and his discouragement must have. The pupil who feels in his suggestible mind that the teacher believes in him, believes in his good side, in his noble qualities, gains confidence in himself and is raised 13 181   to a higher level of activities.	On the other hand, the pupil who perceives that the teacher doubts his abilities, or focuses only on his weaknesses, may become disheartened and lose faith in his own potential. This psychological impact can significantly influence a student's motivation and performance. The teacher's role, then, is not merely to impart knowledge, but also to nurture and affirm the student's self-esteem and belief in their capabilities. It is essential for educators to recognize that their attitudes and words can act as potent instruments of suggestion, shaping the students' perceptions of themselves and their educational journey. By fostering a positive and supportive environment, teachers can utilize suggestion to enhance learning outcomes and encourage students to pursue their interests with enthusiasm and confidence. This approach not only aids in academic growth but also contributes to the holistic development of the child, preparing them for various challenges in life.	1909	2006.2571
"She'D give her eyes to be Mrs. Lawrence Penfold. Choller's farm and Medmerry could join. She'Ll have everything, of course, when Aunt Paybody dies. Don'T be hard on me, dear. I had to think of mother, you see, and I'M going "" — she was backing from the gate with her body, yet she held to the spikes with her fingers, not seeming to realise that Lawrence could have turned the latch at any moment had he chosen — "" up to Manchester for good on Saturday. Mother's coming, too. We'Ve sold the furniture as it stands."" He felt that all the language of the world was required for his dilemma; yet he could say nothing. He only stared, and, looking up the narrow path that went between the little flower beds, saw a figure move, phantomwise and watchful, across the front room window behind the row of plants. This was her mother, who had her eye upon them. He could not oppose these two women, for they were too devilishly clever."	They had orchestrated everything with such precision, aligning their moves like pieces on a chessboard, each step calculated and deliberate. The inevitability of their plans weighed heavily upon Lawrence, trapping him in a web of familial duty and financial necessity. The prospect of inheriting Choller's farm through marriage to a woman he did not love felt like a shackle around his ankle. Yet, how could he deny the comfort it would bring his own mother, who had scrimped and saved, always placing his needs above her own? As he watched her retreating figure, a pang of guilt surged through him. He knew he should feel grateful, perhaps even relieved, that his future was secured. But the hollow in his chest grew wider with each step she took away from him, her fingers reluctantly slipping from the iron spikes of the gate. The finality of her departure was echoed in the click of the latch as it fell into place, a small but significant sound that seemed to seal his fate. Inside, the curtains fluttered slightly as her mother moved away from the window, her silent vigilance	1913	2007.593

Placards and bills on red paper are everywhere."	"The streets are thronged with people, their faces set and determined, waving flags and singing patriotic songs. The air is electric, charged with a fervor that has not been seen in decades. Shops have closed early, workers have left their factories, and all have joined in this monumental gathering. The message is clear and is being broadcasted through every available medium: ""Stand as one, stand for our homeland!"" The League of Defenders has coordinated with local leaders, ensuring that every district, every neighborhood is ready. Messages are passed hand to hand, whispers of encouragement and solidarity fill the evening breeze. The city is pulsating with energy, a unified force waiting for the clock to strike ten. As the hour approaches, the crowds grow denser. Leaders of the movement climb atop makeshift platforms, their voices amplified by the sheer silence of the awaiting crowd. ""Tonight, we stand not just for ourselves but for our future,"" one proclaims, ""for our children, for the very essence of what it means to be part of this great nation."" The anticipation is almost unbearable as watches tick"	1906	1998.8671
Any citizen of the United States may make a filing on one of these farm units. The filing fee for a forty acre farm is $6.50, or $8.00 for eighty acres. If a filing is within the limits of a railroad grant, the fee is $8.00 for a forty acre tract and $11.00 for eighty acres. In addition to the filing fee, the settler must pay the first instalment of the cost of his water right. At Umatilla the total cost is $60.00 per acre, but this is paid in ten annual instalments, without interest. There is also a small charge levied each year for the cost of maintaining and repairing the ditches. It will thus be seen that it will be unwise for any man to attempt to settle upon any of these lands without capital.	The initial outlay, though seemingly modest, can accumulate significantly when combined with the operational costs required to sustain a farm. Beyond the costs of water rights and land maintenance, a settler must consider the expenses for seeds, equipment, livestock, and possibly additional labor. Furthermore, the unpredictability of weather and market prices can pose financial risks that demand a prudent reserve of funds. It is also essential for potential settlers to possess or quickly develop a robust knowledge of agriculture, particularly the specific crops and livestock suited to the regional climate and soil conditions. The success of a farm in these territories relies heavily on the settler's ability to manage and cultivate the land efficiently. Local agricultural extension services and experienced neighboring farmers can be invaluable resources for newcomers. They can offer guidance on best practices and potential pitfalls in the local farming community. Additionally, cooperative associations may provide opportunities for cost-sharing on equipment and supplies, and offer a platform for selling produce and livestock at more competitive rates. In summary, while the opportunity to own and operate a farm on these lands is an attractive proposition, it requires careful financial planning, a solid	1911	2001.6378
These considerations may seem trite, yet experience constantly demonstrates the necessity for their vigilant observance. It is disquieting to reflect on the inefficiency and even harmfulness of much of the medical practice of the past. Yet our predecessors were men of sincerity and high ideals, and had the trust and confidence of the mass of the people. The therapeutic successes of the past must be construed mainly as an exemplification of the potency and action of psychotherapy. Although the scientific method imposes rigorous criteria for the acceptance of doctrines, yet truths so established rest on a firm and abiding basis.	The modern physician must therefore strive to blend the scientific rigor of evidence-based medicine with the compassionate understanding that characterized the more personal doctor-patient relationships of earlier times. It is in this synthesis that the true art of medicine lies—a practice not only informed by the latest research and technological advances but also deeply attuned to the psychological and emotional needs of the patient. As we continue to uncover new layers of complexity in human biology and disease, the importance of maintaining a holistic approach becomes even more paramount. This does not mean a return to outdated methods, but rather an integration of new knowledge with the wisdom that has been accumulated through centuries of medical practice. It is through such an approach that we can hope to address not only the biological mechanisms of disease but also the human suffering associated with illness. In doing so, we must also be mindful of the lessons from the past regarding the limits of medical intervention and the potential for harm. The history of medicine is replete with examples of well-intentioned treatments that later proved to be ineffective or even detrimental. This historical perspective should instill in us a sense of humility	1911	2006.5651
... I saw him act in a tragedy which he had himself touched up, for to the merit of excelling on the stage he joined that of being one of the most agreeable poets of his nation; I saw him, I say, act a tyrant who, terrified at the enormity of his  crimes, dies torn by remorse. The last act was given up to regret and grief. Human nature triumphed over murder and barbarity; at its voice the tyrant was stirred to a due detestation of his crimes, which became, little by little, his judges and his torturers. At each moment death was written more clearly on his face : his eyes grew dim, his voice would scarcely answer the efforts he made to articulate his thoughts.	His limbs trembled, his whole frame was shaken by convulsive movements, and the audience, wholly absorbed by the spectacle, could not restrain their tears. The actor had so thoroughly penetrated into the spirit of his character, that the illusion was almost complete. The spectators felt not as if they were witnessing a performance, but as if they were present at the actual agony of a desolate soul. The power of his grief was such that it seemed to draw the very breath from those who watched, hanging on each whispered word, each heavy sigh. As the tragic scene unfolded, the tyrant's confessions became increasingly fervent and desperate. His voice, fraught with sorrow, now pleaded for the solace of oblivion. Through his superb acting, the remorse that gnawed at his heart was made palpable, the weight of his guilt a visible cloak that bowed his shoulders and sank him to his knees. In the dim, flickering light of the stage, shadows danced across his face, mirroring the dark descent of his soul into despair. The climax of the play was a masterful	1912	1898.1433
It is evident that these five factors stand in closest correlation. That adjusting activity which we feel is not only accompanied by greater vividness, but leads backward to a sharper and clearer view of the object. This clearer view again reenforces the impulse to the adjusted activity. Moreover, it is the clearness and vividness which secures those associations in which the idea develops itself. And the richer this development the more all the opposite ideas  160   must be inhibited and crowded out of the mind. But the more the opposite ideas are suppressed the greater the opportunity for the attended idea to control our reactions. And in this way we have a circular movement by which our attention grows from its own resources. To be sure, this growth has its narrow limits.	The mind cannot indefinitely sustain the high level of focus required for such intricate processes. Fatigue inevitably sets in, leading to a natural decline in the intensity of attention. As the mind tires, the initially suppressed opposite ideas begin to resurface, challenging the dominance of the attended idea and gradually diluting the focus. This interplay between focus and fatigue highlights the dynamic nature of attention, which is not a static state but a fluctuating one, influenced by both internal cognitive processes and external environmental factors. Furthermore, the quality of attention is not only a matter of cognitive control but also of motivation and interest. The more personally meaningful or intriguing an idea or object is to an individual, the more likely it is that attention will be sustained over longer periods. This motivational aspect ties back into the circular movement of attention, as increased interest can lead to a heightened state of focus, which in turn enhances the clarity and vividness of the object of attention, reinforcing the cycle. Thus, attention is not merely a passive occurrence but an active, dynamic engagement of the mind, constantly influenced by a blend of cognitive, emotional	1909	2001.4523
If she turned or yawed, her turn must give time for the Kincardineshire to get at her. The gunners in the four destroyers shot magnificently. Their projectiles were small, but for fifteen minutes they made incessant hits upon the German ship's bow. At last their punishment had the desired effect upon her. Angry at the attack of these puny little antagonists, the German captain turned to bring his broadside to bear. As he did so, the destroyers quickened to thirty knots, and altered course. Though the German guns maintained a rapid fire upon them, they were going so fast that they escaped out of effective range without any serious damage, regained their station on their enemy's bow, and then reduced speed till they were within easy range for their little guns.	"The tension on the decks of the destroyers was palpable as each sailor performed his duty with a grim determination, knowing full well the stakes of this naval engagement. The German ship, now clearly aggravated by the relentless harassment, attempted to orchestrate a counter maneuver. However, the agility and coordination of the destroyers proved superior. The smaller ships danced around the lumbering giant, their nimble movements frustrating the crew of the larger vessel. In a display of tactical prowess, the destroyers executed a series of quick, sharp turns, further confounding their adversary. Each hit from their cannons, though individually small, collectively began to wear down the structural integrity of the German ship’s armor. Puffs of smoke and the screech of metal filled the air, a testament to the efficacy of their assault. Captain Morris of the lead destroyer, the HMS Swift, could see through his binoculars the visible signs of damage on the German ship's hull. He shouted orders to his crew, urging them to maintain their precision and intensity. ""Keep at it, boys! She’s starting to feel"	1906	1974.6687
among kings would heartily applaud the contempt which President Taft and other enemies of popular sovereignty express for the sovereign voter, their studied insults to the electorate and the very principles upon which our government rests ought to be resented in no uncertain manner by the voters. We are told by the political bosses and the mouthpieces of corrupt privilege and monopoly that if the people have the power to recall the judges, the mob would terrorise the bench. Now who is this terrorist mob?	It is none other than the common citizen, the very backbone of the nation, who exercises his rights within the framework of democracy. To label such civic participation as the actions of a 'mob' is not only misleading but a grave insult to the very principles of democratic governance. The term 'mob' suggests a lawless, disorderly group, yet what is being advocated is a legal, structured process provided by the mechanisms of our constitution—a recall, not a revolution. This fear-mongering tactic is used by those who wish to maintain the status quo, protecting their positions of power and privilege from the scrutiny and accountability demanded by the electorate. The right to recall, far from being a tool of terror, is a fundamental aspect of participatory democracy, ensuring that those in positions of judicial authority remain responsive to the people they serve. Moreover, the argument that the judiciary needs to be protected from the whims of the electorate overlooks the essential fact that the judiciary, like any branch of government, should not operate in isolation from the societal values and norms it is meant to uphold. If a judge is	1911	1986.0992
April 18, 1869, the people of Zurich adopted the new constitution by a vote of 35,498 to 22,366. In the elections for the new Council of State the seven names of the democratic ticket were carried: Scherrcr, Muller, Brandli, Gottlieb, Ziegler, Walder, Pfenninger and Sieber. Also the seats of the canton in the Council of States and numerous seats in the National Council fell soon to the Democrats. . . . The new taxation laws were sanctioned by the people with considerable majorities, excepting the one on inventorization in case of death.	This particular law was met with significant opposition, reflecting a general unease about the implications it might have on inheritances and the privacy of estate matters. Despite this setback, the overall trend demonstrated a clear shift towards more progressive governance under the new constitution. The democratic leadership, buoyed by their electoral success, proceeded to implement a series of reforms aimed at improving social welfare and expanding public infrastructure. The introduction of compulsory education laws saw a substantial increase in school attendance, which in turn fostered a more literate populace. Efforts to modernize the canton's infrastructure also gained momentum, with significant investments in the expansion of railway networks and public health systems. These initiatives were largely financed through the revised taxation system which, despite its controversies, proved effective in redistributing wealth and funding public services. As Zurich transformed under these reforms, it began to attract attention from other cantons and even from abroad. Observers noted the marked improvements in social equity and economic vitality, which contrasted sharply with the stagnation seen in less progressive regions. The success of Zurich's model soon inspired similar democratic movements throughout Switzerland,	1911	1990.6262
She hoisted the white flag, while her captain opened her sea valves, to send her to the bottom. But the British destroyers were too quick for him ; a boarding party dashed on board from the Camelopard, and closed the Kingston valves before enough water had been taken into the double bottom to endanger the liner. In this brief action between two very unequally matched ships, the Germans suffered very severely. They had fifty officers and men killed or wounded out of a crew of 500, while in the British cruiser and the destroyers only fifteen casualties were recorded. The Kincardineshire stood by her valuable prize to secure it and clear the vessel of the German crew. The Kronprinz Wilhelm was on fire in two places, and was badly damaged by the British shells.	Efforts to extinguish the fires were immediately undertaken by the British crew, with hoses and fire extinguishers rapidly deployed. The flames, which had been licking the sides of the engine room and threatening to reach the munitions store, were soon under control. Meanwhile, the rest of the boarding party set about securing the ship, detaining the remaining German sailors and ensuring no further sabotage attempts could be made. The damage to the Kronprinz Wilhelm was extensive. The British engineers assessed the situation, finding that the shell impacts had compromised the structural integrity in several key areas. Temporary repairs were made to make the vessel seaworthy enough to be towed. The Kincardineshire radioed for a tug and additional support to help bring the captured liner back to a British port for thorough repairs and inspection. As the British flag was raised over the Kronprinz Wilhelm, cheers erupted from the crew of the Kincardineshire. This victory was not just a strategic gain but also a significant morale booster for the Royal Navy. The capture of a German liner, especially one as formidable as the	1906	1939.1984
Deficit is the cause; retardation is an effect. The result is the increase of crime and the loss of moral tone. The deterioration due to a deficit is not more marked than that due to a surplus. An animal eats freely and even gorges itself without injury because the energy to acquire food must always be kept active in order to assure survival. Men, however, separate action from enjoyment; those who are favoured in income can expand their consumption without correspondingly increasing their activity. The constant stimulation of appetite and the overworking of organs to relieve the system of its load leads to morbidness and disease. It also results in the creation of toxic substances which poison the body and depress mental activity. These evils react on the will and reduce its power to control thought and activity.	Thus, a surplus, like a deficit, can lead to a weakening of moral fiber and an increase in societal issues. The imbalance created by either extreme disrupts the natural order and equilibrium necessary for healthy living. This parallels the economic principle where both inflation and deflation can be harmful, requiring a balance for optimal function. In human behavior, this balance is pivotal in maintaining a society where individuals are neither excessively deprived nor excessively indulged. The moral implications of such economic disparities are profound. They not only affect individual health and well-being but also influence the broader social fabric. Communities where these imbalances are pronounced may see higher rates of crime, social unrest, and a general decline in the quality of life. This is because both excess and lack can create environments where the basic human needs and desires are not met in a balanced way, leading to various forms of dysfunction. Therefore, it is vital for societies to strive towards economic and social policies that promote a more equitable distribution of resources, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to engage in meaningful activities that contribute to their well-being and that of the community.	1911	1998.2908
It had been supposed at the time that they were permanently injured, but hundreds of skilled Glasgow artisans had been brought over by train and set to work upon them, and with such energy had they laboured that the damage had been almost made good. For security against any German attack, the ships lay with booms surrounding them  behind a great mine field, which had been placed by the naval authorities. The Rear admiral in command of the Northern Fleet ordered a passage through the German minefield to be cleared without delay, and the repaired ships to remain for the time being to guard the port, as their speed was not such as to enable them to run if the enemy appeared in force. Taking with him the Impfrieuse, he moved down the coast towards Newcastle, steaming at 15 knots.	The sea was rough, with a brisk wind whipping up whitecaps that danced menacingly under a leaden sky. The Impérieuse, with her newly patched hull cutting through the waves, was a testament to the urgency and efficiency of the wartime repairs. The admiral's face was set in a grim line as he scanned the horizon, aware of the weight of responsibility resting on his shoulders. As the fleet moved southward, the tension on the bridge was palpable. Every man knew that the waters they navigated were infested with enemy submarines and mines. The sonar operators were on high alert, their ears tuned for the slightest ping that would indicate a lurking danger. Meanwhile, additional precautions were taken to secure the safety of the fleet. Scout planes were dispatched at dawn, their pilots squinting into the distance, searching for any sign of the German ships. Radio operators maintained a constant vigil, the crackle of static a persistent reminder of the threat that could be broadcast at any moment. The admiral had made his decision based on the strategic necessity of maintaining a strong naval presence in	1906	1964.7676

Skirmishes outside country houses are dignified by the name of sieges; a melee of a few horse is often called a battle, while the lack of plan and purpose in much of the fighting makes the general observer underrate, if anything, the position of this English episode in the general military history of the seventeenth century. He thinks of it as a sort of isolated and petty event thrown up by the general commotion of the Thirty Years' War and of the vaster struggle which was proceeding   PLACES CONNECTED  WITH   throughout Europe between central authority and the oligarchic principle of government. Small, however, as were the numbers engaged, and amateurish and sporadic as was the strategy displayed, the military side of the Civil Wars must be grasped by any one who desires to understand the history of England.	The tactics employed, although often rudimentary, were nevertheless evolving during this period, reflecting a transition from medieval to more modern forms of warfare. Commanders on both sides, such as Prince Rupert of the Rhine and Oliver Cromwell, began to recognize the importance of mobility and the effective use of cavalry, which would later become hallmarks of the New Model Army. The sieges and battles, though small in scale compared to continental conflicts, were fierce and demonstrated significant determination and resourcefulness. Furthermore, the Civil Wars were not merely military conflicts but also a crucible for political and social change. The struggle between King and Parliament was a struggle for the very soul of the nation, questioning the divine right of kings and paving the way for a nascent form of democracy. In this light, the military engagements were intertwined with the greater ideological battles that would shape the governance of England and influence the development of modern political systems. Thus, while the military aspects of the Civil Wars might seem minor or chaotic to the casual observer, they were in fact integral to understanding the broader shifts in English society and governance during	1912	1987.0353
Hart, however, was really afraid to let the envelope go out of his possession lest it be tampered with. He firmly believed in the genuineness of the letter, as we all did, and he thoroughly distrusted the good faith of the prosecutors. He thought they would secrete or tamper with the envelope if they once got possession of it, and it was the envelope upon which he relied as clinching the proof of the genuineness of the letter. Not until contempt proceedings were imminent, therefore, and Judge Davis had promised to retain the envelope in his own personal custody and return it at the end, would Hart give it up. But he trusted Judge Davis, and upon that promise he produced the envelope. As soon as Judge Davis got possession of the envelope, he did what no one else had thought of doing, and what to Hart would have seemed like wanton desecration.	He carefully opened the sealed flap, smoothing it down to prevent any tearing. Inside, he found not only the letter in question but also a smaller, hidden note folded into a narrow strip, tucked away in the very edge of the envelope. This note, written in a hasty scrawl, contained a few lines that cast an entirely new light on the matter at hand. It was a brief confession from the original sender, admitting to a deception that had not been previously disclosed. Judge Davis, maintaining his composure, called for immediate attention in the courtroom. He read the hidden note aloud, ensuring every word was clear and audible to all present. The revelation sent a murmur through the room, and the faces of the prosecutors turned visibly pale. Hart, on the other hand, stood in stunned silence, his earlier confidence shaken by this unexpected twist. The judge then proceeded to discuss the implications of this new evidence, emphasizing the importance of thorough examination and the preservation of integrity in legal proceedings. He praised Hart for his diligence in protecting the envelope but noted that this case highlighted the necessity for even deeper	1911	1992.8197

It is a fundamental aspect of the law that prevents unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted material, ensuring that creators can reap the potential benefits from their intellectual efforts. Without such protection, the incentive to create and innovate could be significantly undermined, as would the broader cultural and economic contributions of creative works. Furthermore, the importance of securing copyright protection before dissemination is underscored by the risk of losing exclusive rights to the work. Once a work is published without copyright, it enters the public domain, effectively forfeiting the creator's exclusive rights and opening the work to free use by anyone. This can result in significant financial and professional losses for the creator, who no longer can claim sole ownership or control over how the work is used or distributed. Therefore, it is advisable for creators to thoroughly understand and comply with copyright laws applicable in their jurisdiction.

M = wL x = — - 1 2 2  94 Within the span at a distance * from either support the bending moment is — M, = + *) X - R, * the first term of which is the bending moment at the supports, and the second is bending moment for a uniformly loaded span of length Z2 (see Fig. 65). The two terms are of opposite sign, and, provided /2 is long enough, the bending moment will be zero and change sign at two points within the span, viz. when Mx = o, or — . - . h - x) = o x2 — /2 x + t = o ie. at two points distant {(j - h2} on either side of mid span; the two points are coincident (at mid span) if /2 = u and do not exist if 4 is less than 2^, when the bending moment does not change sign. Points of Contraflexure.	Points of contraflexure occur where the bending moment changes sign, indicating a shift from tension to compression or vice versa within the beam's material. These points are critical in structural analysis as they represent locations of zero bending moment, and thus, the internal forces in the beam switch direction. For engineers and architects, identifying these points is essential for understanding how a structure will behave under load and ensuring that the design can accommodate these changes without failure. Continuing from the quadratic equation derived, \( x^2 - l_2 x + t = 0 \), we can solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula: \[ x = \frac{l_2 \pm \sqrt{l_2^2 - 4t}}{2} \] This solution gives the positions of the points of contraflexure relative to the supports. The discriminant \( (l_2^2 - 4t) \) determines the nature of these points. If the discriminant is positive, there are two real and distinct points of contraflexure.

seventy-six percent, of them are in villages of less, than two thousand inhabitants. Once fundamentally poor, they are now able to show a total annual business of one billion two hundred million dollars. The number of co operative credit banks of all sorts in Germany at the present time is more than seventeen thousand, with a total turn over of six billion dollars. Of these, Saxon market women forty-six hundred are in the Raiffeisen Federation; nine thousand included with them in the Imperial Union of Agricultural Societies; a thousand other banks in this union with limited liability and large shares, a compromise between the two types. Twelve hundred are town banks of the Schulze delitzsch system; about four hundred of them in the big cities with limited liability, and the rest still unlimited, as Schulze delitzsch left them. In Boberrohrsdorf and its equally charming neighbour, Alt Kemnitz, both lying in the Riesengebirge, that fringe of friendly mountains at the south of Silesia beyond which lies Austria, are two little banks characteristic of the valuable system which has given every honest farmer in Germany a new resource, and at the same time has provided him with especial reason for interest in the welfare of his neighbour.	These banks, small and unassuming as they may appear, are integral to the lifeblood of the local economy, serving not merely as financial institutions but as communal pillars that uphold the principles of mutual aid and cooperation. In Boberrohrsdorf, the bank operates from a modest building near the village square, its operations overseen by a manager who is also the local schoolmaster. Here, loans are given not solely based on financial standing, but with consideration to character and community standing, reinforcing the ties that bind the villagers together. Alt Kemnitz’s bank, similarly, functions more as a community center than a mere financial institution. On any given day, one might find a group of farmers discussing crop prices, or a meeting being held to plan the upcoming harvest festival. The bank’s role extends beyond mere finance; it is involved in agricultural advice, the purchase of seeds and equipment, and even educational programs to improve farming techniques. Such is the nature of these cooperative banks that their success is measured not only in financial terms but in the welfare of the community. They are built on a	1913	1999.1473
I will it without the least expectation that some one else may will the same. 49   All that my will is seeking is my personal satisfaction, which means my own pleasure. But if I see a man whom I do not know in mortal danger, my will aims to help him. The purpose of my will is now the saving of his life. It is my own will, and yet this time I do not will it for my personal end, for my private interest, for my own pleasure. It is a will in me, the aim of which has no reference to my well-being, but to something which is of common value to everyone, the respect for human life. If I will to help and not to kill, to protect and not to steal, to speak the truth and not to lie, the purpose of my will is on each occasion independent of my personal pleasure and advantage. It may even be in conflict with my personal desires, and yet my will toward the painful sacrifice is strong.	This is because such actions are dictated by a deeper, more universal principle that transcends individual desire: the moral law within us. This law compels us to act not out of self-interest, but out of a sense of duty to uphold the intrinsic worth of every human being. It is this moral imperative that gives the will its noblest purpose and its most profound justification. When we act in accordance with this moral law, we experience a unique kind of satisfaction, different from mere pleasure. It is the satisfaction of having done what is right, of having affirmed the dignity of life and the bonds that tie humanity together. In these moments, our will aligns with a higher order of principles, and we transcend our isolated selves. Thus, the will, while inherently personal and directed by individual motives, can also express the universal and the ethical. It bridges the gap between our private interests and the broader, communal values that sustain social life and human cooperation. In doing so, it reveals the dual nature of human agency: capable of pursuing both personal desires and higher, altruistic goals.	1909	1928.3883
The widespread belief that memory remains constant, that only external tricks of  144   learning can be acquired, and that one is born with a good or a bad memory which cannot be changed must be eradicated. The mere formal training counts wonderfully, but it must be a real training in memorising. The pedagogical experiments seem quite conclusive there. And the training does not only secure the fuller development of the power to learn but counteracts effectively the natural loss of the retaining power in later years. It is an important question whether our present school tendencies are sufficiently adapted to this fundamental fact, the more as we must not forget that for the overwhelming majority of school children the whole training falls into a period in which the natural development of their memory has not reached its highest power. All these observations refer to the average. Perhaps no factor shades this average so much as the variety of ideational types to which we referred when we discussed apperception.	The individual differences in the way people process and retain information are significant, and understanding these variations can lead to more effective methods of teaching and learning. Some individuals have a predominantly visual memory, others are more auditory or kinesthetic. In the classroom, this diversity is often not adequately addressed, leading to a one-size-fits-all approach that can hinder the learning potential of many students. Moreover, the role of emotion and interest in memory retention is crucial and often underestimated. Material that engages the student emotionally or is deemed relevant to their lives is more likely to be remembered. Educational systems that emphasize rote memorization without connecting the material to the students' personal experiences or broader societal contexts fail to leverage this aspect of human cognitive function. Therefore, an educational reform that incorporates these insights into human memory and learning processes is essential. Such a reform would tailor teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles and emphasize the connection between new information and existing knowledge and experiences. This approach not only enhances memory retention but also fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the material, preparing students more effectively for the complexities of modern life.

PL): 21 N dell's Summary of Contracts 1022. Supp.	Indeed, the principle that a promise must be supported by consideration to be enforceable remains a cornerstone of contract law. Consideration, which can be either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee, must be something of value in the eyes of the law. This could be an act, forbearance, or a return promise that is bargained for as part of the agreement. Without this exchange, a contract typically lacks the binding force necessary for enforcement. In cases where a contract is formed by subscription, as often seen in charitable donations, the courts have sometimes been willing to find an enforceable contract even where traditional consideration may seem lacking. This is particularly true where the subscriber's promise leads the promisee to take substantial actions in reliance on that promise, such as beginning construction on a building. In such instances, principles such as promissory estoppel come into play, preventing the promisor from revoking their promise due to the substantial reliance induced by their commitment. Furthermore, if a subscription contract specifies that the subscriber's obligations are contingent upon certain conditions being met, those	1913	1954.23
"Yet it must not be supposed that it was ever so. The objects which have been handed down to us from the past reveal great conscientiousness on the part of their makers. "" Man will just as soon do good as bad work; I think, even, he likes the former best, it being more in conformity with his nature. But he listens now to good, now to evil, counsel, and just at present he is following the evil. "" And yet, how much happier humanity would be if work, instead of being life's ransom, were its aim. """	If men labored not merely to satisfy immediate needs but to build enduring legacies, to create works that would outlast them and bring joy or utility to future generations, surely their spirits would be more content and their days filled with greater purpose. In the past, the craftsman’s hands shaped more than mere utility; they breathed a soul into the very fibers of his creation. Whether it was the delicate carving on a cathedral door, the intricate stitching on a tapestry, or the robust construction of a wooden bridge, the work was a testament to the creator's dedication and a reflection of his identity. This sense of lasting accomplishment, this merging of effort and artistry, has lost its prominence in modern times. The rush for quantity and immediate gratification has overshadowed the pursuit of quality and permanence. The modern economy, with its relentless focus on efficiency and profit, often leaves little room for the meticulous and the magnificent. Yet, the yearning for meaningful work, for craftsmanship that transcends time, persists in the heart of humanity. It speaks to a fundamental aspect of our nature, the	1911	1960.1633
I overheard a tourist explaining to his companions how the old glaciers had brought them there, apparently ignorant of the fact that they were far beyond the southern limit of the old ice sheet. It is quite evident that they were harder masses that had weathered out of the  840 place rock and had slowly tumbled about and crept down the hill under the expansive power of the sun's rays. But I saw one drift boulder in southern California that was a puzzle; it was a waterworn mass of metamorphic rock, nearly as high as my head, at the end of a valley several miles in among the hills, with no kindred rocks or stones near it. It was evidently far from home, but what its means of transportation had been I could only conjecture. Amid the flock of grey and brown boulders that dot my native fields there is here and there a black sheep — a rough coated rock much darker than the rest, which the farmers call fire stone, mainly, I suppose, because they do not break or explode in the fire.	These darker stones, often volcanic in origin, contrast sharply with the lighter sedimentary and metamorphic rocks typically found in the region. Their presence hints at ancient geological upheavals that brought these alien rocks from distant volcanic fields or perhaps from deep underground via eruptive forces. Such stones serve as a reminder of the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the Earth's crust, where the slow but inexorable forces of geology transport materials over vast distances and timescales, often leaving behind little evidence of their journeys except for the rocks themselves. As I continued my exploration, I noted the varied textures and compositions of the rocks scattered about the landscape. Some were smooth and rounded, polished by eons of water flow, while others were jagged and sharp, freshly broken from their parent formations. Each rock, with its unique characteristics, tells a story of its origin—whether thrust up from the Earth's depths, carried by water, or transported by glacial ice. The diversity of the geological landscape here is a testament to the complex interplay of environmental factors that shape and reshape the Earth's surface, providing endless	1913	1992.6703
"""I am too ill, "" he confided to the servant who knew a little English, ""too much ill to be alone here. I go to Lawassi to a proper English doctor. You stop here for more pay."" M'sai Uganda drove up in the ox cart. ""Sickness?"" he inquired. Then Bellinger told him in a faint voice of his suffering and of his need for more medicine. ""But I must take the money with me, M'sai, "" he continued, ""and I must travel by daylight, so that if any thieves break away with a tin of gold on their heads I can see to shoot. There are sixty-eight tins, and there must be extra men for this safari [caravan], for each load is very heavy. Get seventy men, and hurry. I will have my bed put on the ox cart, and lie on it with my back against the joy of kings."	"M'sai Uganda nodded, his face grave with concern. ""I will find the men,"" he assured Bellinger. ""We will make haste."" As the servant scurried away to arrange for the necessary manpower, Bellinger's mind, despite the pain and fever, turned to the logistics of the journey. The route to Lawassi was fraught with dangers, not least from bandits lured by the promise of gold. The very thought of the precious cargo made him clutch tighter the small, sturdy box that contained his personal share of the treasure. By the time the sun was beginning to climb the next morning, the caravan was ready. Seventy robust men stood by, each prepared to shoulder a heavy tin. Bellinger, pale but resolute, was carefully lifted onto the ox cart, his makeshift bed secured firmly in place. His rifle lay within easy reach, a silent sentinel against potential threats. As the caravan set off, the rhythmic trudge of feet and the creaking of the ox cart filled the air. Bellinger, half-reclined and wrapped in blankets,"	1913	1968.7794
The addition of small quantities, I to 3 percent, of lime or magnesia accelerates the action of steam in hydrolysing fats, and if similarly small quantities of the alkalis that give soluble soaps be added the acceleration is greater still. At the temperature of boiling water, however, even the addition of sufficient alkali to combine with all the fatty acids obtainable from a fat, or even of excess of alkali, does not bring about hydrolysis sufficiently rapidly for laboratory purposes. In the laboratory hydrolysis is carried out usually by means of excess of alcoholic alkali solutions. In this case the greater solubility of fats in alcohol makes the alcoholysis, the formation of ethyl esters of the fatty acids, occur more rapidly than hydrolysis, the formation of the acids themselves, which would occur in water alone.	Thus, by utilizing alcoholic alkali, the reaction can be efficiently controlled and driven towards completion in a relatively short period. The standard procedure involves heating the fat with an excess of alcoholic potassium hydroxide. This method ensures that the glycerol backbone of the fat molecules breaks down, releasing the fatty acid chains, which then react with the ethanol to form ethyl esters—commonly known as biodiesel when derived from vegetable oils and animal fats.  Moreover, the reaction is typically carried out under reflux conditions to prevent the loss of alcohol to evaporation and to maintain a constant reaction temperature. The choice of alkali, commonly potassium or sodium hydroxide, is significant because these strong bases are highly efficient at breaking the ester bonds present in triglycerides. After the reaction is complete, the mixture is usually neutralized with an acid to halt the reaction, and the resultant product is then separated by standard separation techniques such as decantation, centrifugation, or extraction. This method of hydrolysis, or more accurately, alcoholysis, is crucial in biofuel production and	1913	2004.1991
In this case the first perceptible effect of the disease is when a purplish spot appears on the side of the berry. Later, the fruit is covered with a white mould, then it turns brown, and later on becomes soft and wrinkled. Remedies. Spraying as recommended for Black Rot. Powdery Mildew (Vncinula necator). This mildew forms a superficial, cobweb like growth on the leaves and new growth, and occasionally on the fruit. The remedies are the same as for Downy Mildew. It is also recommended to spray the vines in the winter with copper sulphate solution to destroy the winter spores. Flowers of sulphur has also been used successfully against this disease.	For best results, the sulphur should be applied when the vines are dry, ideally in early morning so that the dew can help the sulphur adhere to the plants. Regular applications throughout the growing season are necessary, especially during periods of high humidity which favor the growth of mildew.  Downy Mildew (Plasmopara viticola) is another common vine disease which manifests as yellowish spots on the upper surfaces of leaves, with a white, downy growth on the undersides. This mildew thrives in wet conditions, making diligent management of vineyard moisture essential. Proper canopy management to ensure good air circulation and reduce leaf wetness can be beneficial.  For chemical control, fungicides containing copper compounds or mancozeb can be applied. It is crucial to start the treatment early in the season, as preventative measures are more effective than trying to control the disease after it has established. Additionally, rotating fungicides with different modes of action can help prevent the development of resistance. In all cases, following the manufacturer's guidelines for dosage and application frequency is essential to ensure	1914	1974.048
But she could not stay. It seemed to her that she must make all haste as a sinner to the confessional, to purge her mind of what was wearying it. Three miles along, the old mill road began to climb a hill, and it climbed with varying degrees of steepness for one mile more. The day was cold and clear, a winter day, the bright air having much ado to assure you it was winter, there was so little snow on the frozen ground. There were deep ruts in the road for long, wind swept spaces; and Althea, flying over them, felt them bruise her feet. But she scorned the troubles of the way. The path her mind was treading was far more troublous than the path that hurt her feet.	As she reached the crest of the hill, the old mill came into view, its weathered timbers standing stark against the crisp blue sky. Its wheel, long since motionless, hung icily over the frozen stream that once had powered it. Althea paused, catching her breath, not from the climb but from the rush of emotions that the sight of the mill unleashed. It was here, in the shadow of this silent sentinel, that she had last spoken to Jonathan before he went away, his words still echoing in her heart, a mixture of promise and goodbye. With a determined set to her jaw, she continued down the path that led directly to the mill. Each step seemed to draw up memories from the hardened earth — laughter, whispered secrets, the touch of a hand now long absent. As she approached the door, its hinges protested with a groan as she pushed it open, the sound slicing through the quiet like a sharp intake of breath. Inside, the air was thick with the must of disuse. Shafts of light pierced through gaps in the planks, casting	1913	1981.2732
These changes are always very gradual and, within a given period of relatively short duration, slight or even imperceptible in amount. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of these slight linguistic changes is, with the lapse of time, so great that the form of speech current at a given time, when directly compared with the form of speech of the same language current at a considerably earlier time, is found to differ from the latter much as it might from a foreign language. It is true that the rate of change has been found to be more rapid at some periods of a language than at others, but it nevertheless always remains true that the changes themselves are not violent and sudden, but gradual in character.	"This principle of gradual transformation applies not only to phonetic changes but also to changes in vocabulary, syntax, and semantic shifts. Over centuries, words may shift in meaning, new syntactic structures may emerge, and old ones may fall into disuse. For instance, Old English, with its complex system of gender and case endings, has evolved into Modern English, which relies much less on inflectional morphology and more on word order for grammatical function. Similarly, words like ""awful"" originally meant ""inspiring wonder"" and have come to mean ""extremely bad"" in contemporary usage. The mechanisms driving these changes are manifold. They include the influence of other languages, whether through conquest, trade, or cultural exchange, as well as internal innovations and the natural tendency of speakers to simplify complex forms. Language change is also influenced by sociolinguistic factors, where shifts in power, prestige, and social identity can lead to the adoption of new linguistic forms by a speech community. Thus, while the language of Chaucer may seem distant and foreign to a modern English speaker, it is"	1911	2006.6697
"Every individual has some influence; for every one there is a work to do. He who evades it does so at his peril; for ""Life is a mission, "" and ""Duty is divine."" THE PROPOSED ANGLO american ARBITRATION TREATY T HAT was an inspiring spectacle recently presented in Great Britain, when in a single day nine hundred mass meetings were held to express the people's endorsement of the proposed treaty between England and the United States, by which all questions shall  171 be settled by arbitration. And quite as significant of the popular sentiment was the hearty endorsement of the proposal by ten thousand free churches of Great Britain."	This universal show of support not only highlights the nations' commitment to peace but also underlines the deep-seated kinship and mutual respect that the United States and Great Britain have fostered over centuries. The proposed treaty marks a significant step forward in international relations, aiming to resolve conflicts through dialogue and legal processes rather than through force and aggression. Moreover, the involvement of the free churches is particularly noteworthy, as it reflects a moral and ethical backing to the legal and political dimensions of arbitration. It is an acknowledgment that peace is not merely a political necessity but a moral imperative. Their support serves as a reminder that behind the mechanics of treaties and the formalities of diplomacy lies the fundamental human desire for harmony and understanding. As discussions progress and the finer details of the treaty are debated and refined, it is crucial that this spirit of collective goodwill remains at the forefront. The path to lasting peace requires not only the agreement of governments but the support of their people. The enthusiastic response from citizens and churches alike is a promising sign that this treaty has the potential to be genuinely transformative, paving the way for a future where	1911	1993.3923
Hostages to the future are these ponderous abutments; and when the undreamed structure does soar heavenward there will be no disruption of the new loop to anchor its framework firmly to the earth. There is something stirring in the contemplation of these prophetic footings, something eloquent of the superb confidence that animates the restless world beneath which they wait. Here in 1750 stretched the questionable waters of Collect Pond, beneath whose deposit of ancient slime now curves the Centre Street loop. today the city has chosen a portion of the old site of the pond as the location of its new courthouse. Turning to the larger view, it must be evident that it is by transportation, whether subconsciously or not, that the colour of men's lives is primarily influenced and ultimately dominated, in evidence of which consider the present condition of the northern and eastern flanks of New York City. New communities have sprung up wherever the subways and Elevated have penetrated.	These burgeoning neighborhoods, once remote and inaccessible, have become vibrant hubs of activity, drawing in waves of new residents and businesses. The sweep of the railway lines has not just altered the geography but has rewritten the social and economic fabric of the city. Where once lay fallow land or dilapidated estates, now rise high-rise apartments, bustling commercial districts, and verdant parks, all pulsating with the frenetic energy of urban life. As the city expands outward, the arteries of transport stretch further, binding the metropolis together in a complex web of steel and steam. The once distinct boundaries between city and suburb blur, as continuous development bridges the gap, creating a seamless urban landscape. This metamorphosis is not merely physical; it is deeply cultural. The influx of diverse populations brings with them their unique traditions, cuisines, languages, and arts, enriching the city’s cultural tapestry. This transformation, driven by the expansion of transport networks, illustrates the profound impact of infrastructure on urban development. It is not merely about the convenience of movement but about the creation of opportunities, the shaping	1913	2002.7827
Brush discharge of electricity from any charged object. Propellers of aircraft flying near thunderstorms frequently develop St. Elmo's fire.

Relative humidity, a measure of the actual amount of moisture in the air compared to the total amount it could hold at that temperature. This is expressed as a percentage. Dew point, the temperature to which air must be cooled for saturation to occur, leading to condensation and the formation of dew. This is a key indicator of atmospheric moisture. Barometric pressure, the force exerted by the atmosphere at a given point. It is an important factor in weather prediction and is usually measured in millibars or inches of mercury. Anemometer, a device used to measure wind speed. Commonly used in meteorological stations to assess wind conditions. Coriolis effect, the deflection of moving objects when viewed in a rotating reference frame; in Earth's atmosphere, this effect influences wind directions. Wind shear, a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance, which can be hazardous during flight operations.	1913	1968.6656
It will be seen that a considerable increase in the pressure applied does not appreciably increase the overrun. The effect of suddenly increasing the pressure from that corresponding with 40 mph. to 54 and 64 mph. was also tried. In each case the overrun amounted to 3-5 mph. (with 30 feet of 1 inch pipe in the circuit). The amount which will be given in an actual record depends, of course, on the rapidity of rise in velocity which is experienced in a natural wind, and the above figures, which were obtained with a perfectly sudden rise, rather indicate the value which cannot be exceeded in practice than that which will actually be obtained. 321 The above results clearly show the greatly decreased sluggishness of the pressure tube type of instrument which is brought about by using 1 inch connecting pipes, and further suggest that if this size of pipe were used considerable differences in the length of pipe might be allowed without any correction being necessary to make the results from different instruments comparable The overrun would undoubtedly be increased by these larger pipes. It should be pointed out that if the time of maximum velocity in a gust is of short duration (which probably is the case) a certain overrun may counteract the natural sluggishness of the instrument and give a more accurate record of the actual maximum velocity than would otherwise be obtained.	In addition to the benefits of larger pipes, it is also important to consider the material of which the pipes are made. Experiments have shown that smoother internal surfaces reduce frictional losses and therefore allow for a more accurate transmission of the pressure changes to the measuring instrument. Materials such as copper or polished steel, though more costly, could potentially enhance performance by reducing the resistance to airflow inside the pipes. Future investigations might also explore the effect of bends and fittings in the piping on the pressure reading accuracy. Sharp angles and multiple fittings can contribute to turbulence and energy loss within the pipe, which in turn could affect the instrument's response time and accuracy. Moreover, the influence of ambient temperature on the density and viscosity of the air, and consequently on the pressure readings, cannot be overlooked. Temperature compensation mechanisms or calibration adjustments might be necessary to ensure consistent performance of the pressure tube instruments under varying environmental conditions. These considerations underscore the complexity of designing an aerodynamic measurement system that is both responsive and accurate. Ongoing research and development are crucial in refining these instruments to better capture the dynamics of rapidly changing wind speeds, especially	1912	2002.7017

Further advancements are also being made in the materials used for construction to ensure they are lightweight yet durable enough to withstand the pressures and stresses associated with flight. Innovations in composite materials and metallurgy are contributing significantly to these improvements. Moreover, attention is being given to the environmental impact of aviation. This includes developing engines that produce fewer emissions and researching alternative fuels such as biofuels or even electric power to replace or supplement traditional petroleum-based aviation fuel. In terms of design, there is a continuous push towards more ergonomic and comfortable interiors for passengers, as well as more functional and accessible cockpits for pilots.

I would not say they are valueless, for sometimes their seed falls into proper ground, and also they eke out the salaries of poor curators and professors. But, on the whole, they are mistaken charity and so constitute a waste, unless great care is taken that there is not a plethora of them. Much attendance on lectures is  like much reading of books, a poor substitute for the activities of life. Again, universities often undertake work that might be much better left to museums. Thus if there is a museum conveniently near it seems to be a waste for a university to plan large taxonomic collections or even to give courses of taxonomic nature. For if a student wishes to learn species and their distinctions, he can gain this knowledge far better in the reference museum than in the laboratory; and to change a laboratory into a museum is to injure its proper use.	Moreover, the duplication of such resources can lead to unnecessary expenditure which could be better allocated towards more pressing educational needs. Universities should focus on fostering original research and providing advanced instruction that cannot be obtained elsewhere. This specialization not only enhances the university's academic reputation but also ensures that resources are used in the most effective and innovative ways possible. In this light, the role of a university should be to encourage deeper exploration of subjects through critical thinking and practical application rather than merely replicating existing materials and facilities. This approach not only conserves resources but also stimulates intellectual growth among students and faculty alike. By concentrating on areas where they can provide unique value—such as specialized research opportunities, advanced theoretical study, and the development of new methodologies—universities can truly fulfill their role as incubators of knowledge and innovation. Furthermore, this focus allows universities to collaborate rather than compete with local museums and other institutions, creating a richer, more diverse educational ecosystem. Such partnerships can facilitate shared expertise, cross-disciplinary research, and greater access to specialized collections and exhibits, benefiting the broader academic community and enhancing the educational experience for	1911	1993.3595
"co.'s "" Good Lighting "" campaign. First, the Company placed the Mazda lamp on the market ; next, they turned their attention to the provision of scientific and artistic reflectors ; finally, they have produced the Mazdalier fitting described above. By the supply of these lighting appliances, and with the assistance (in an advisory capacity) of the Company's Illuminating Engineers' Department, the contractor is enabled to meet every requirement of scientific and satisfactory illumination.

Mrs. Harriet Stanton, the keynote speaker, argued passionately that economic independence was crucial not only for the empowerment of women but also for the progress of society as a whole. She cited examples of women who had successfully managed businesses or pursued careers, contributing significantly to their communities and economies. Mr. Charles Edmondson provided a counterpoint, suggesting that while women's economic independence was desirable, it should not undermine traditional family structures. He emphasized the importance of balance and the potential negative impacts on family life if both parents were overly engaged in pursuits outside the home. The discussion was lively, with members contributing anecdotes from their personal experiences, referencing studies, and quoting notable thinkers on the subject.

"(a) Cotton Weaving. — Here the lighting is uniform and symmetrical, being comparatively constant throughout the entire shed. The process is carried on almost exclusively in "" sheds "" or one story buildings with "" saw back"" roofs, the short sides of which are glazed. The incidence of light is, therefore, vertical, and seeing that the work is in a horizontal plane, this is the best possible arrangement. Owing to the large expanse of window area, the "" window efficiency, "" as determined by the Trotter waldram method, is very efficient; in the table given by Mr. Wilson values up to 44-1000ths are recorded, but the usual range is from 16 to 35 loooths. Generally speaking, the rows of looms run across or at right angles to the direction of the windows, but in sheds in certain districts they run parallel. The former is by far the better arrangement, since the light, coming sideways, throws no shadow on the work. As regards artificial lighting, the object is again to produce a uniform illumination free from objectionable shadow."	(b) Wool Spinning. — In contrast to cotton weaving, wool spinning often takes place in multi-story mills where natural light can be more challenging to distribute evenly. The rooms are typically narrower and the windows smaller, resulting in less natural light reaching the interior spaces. The layout of the machinery also tends to be more compact, which can further complicate lighting issues. To address these challenges, artificial lighting is extensively used to supplement natural light. The lighting fixtures are usually positioned to minimize shadows cast by the machinery and to ensure that the workers can see their tasks clearly. The intensity of light required is generally higher than in cotton weaving because the fibers and threads in wool spinning are often darker and finer, demanding greater visual acuity. (c) Silk Throwing. — Silk throwing involves twisting silk filaments into threads and is a process that requires precise and careful handling. The facilities where silk throwing is performed are usually designed to maximize the control of both natural and artificial light. The windows are often large and strategically placed to ensure that ample light enters the work area, especially since the silk can reflect light and create	1912	2001.001
"While considering such modifications, it was decided to fit a landing gear capable of absorbing much greater vertical shocks; since in cross country flying the liability to forced landings in restricted areas often involves alighting with considerably greater downward velocity thin arises when landing in the open. Moreover, a hard landing is made occasionally in order to reduce the length of run on the ground, ita test of the appliance when made, an experiment was repeatedly tried by Mr. Kemp and Mr. Wingfield Smith, who hazarded the making of a number of bad landings of the type known as ""pancakes, "" viz., getting to a slow speed in the air, below the lowest flying speed, when the aeroplane drops clumsily on to its undercarriage. 46. The experimental chassis first made, in which the shock was absorbed by a special type of oil brake was, after severe trial, handed over to the military fliers and used for some six months in routine work, which it accomplished satisfactorily and is still in use. Meanwhile, the study was prosecuted at the RAF. ou the basis of the first experiment and an improved undercarriage constructed {nee Figs."	47 and 48 in the appendix), which incorporated stronger, more resilient materials and a refined oil brake design. This new model was designed to distribute and dissipate the kinetic energy of a landing more effectively across the structure, reducing the risk of structural damage during those more abrupt descents. Comparative tests were conducted between the original and improved designs, focusing on their performance during repeated 'hard landing' scenarios. These tests were instrumental in determining the durability and reliability of the landing gear under extreme conditions. Flight data was meticulously recorded, noting the precise speeds, angles, and forces involved in each landing. Further enhancements included the integration of telescopic struts, which offered better compression and rebound characteristics. This feature allowed for smoother absorption of the impact forces, thereby improving the overall stability of the aircraft upon landing. The military's feedback after using the upgraded undercarriage was overwhelmingly positive. Pilots reported a noticeable improvement in handling during landings on uneven terrain, which often occurs in field operations. The success of these developments led to the adoption of the new landing gear design as a standard specification on new aircraft models	1912	2006.7487
"Her skirts were tucked up; her thin ankles showed in white stockings above her slatternly  a43 shoes. She walked rapidly toward an ash barrel which stood against the fence that divided the Beasley lot from the Agnews' place. She dashed the contents of the hod into the barrel, and stood in the grey cloud of dust rubbing her nose. She always did this when she was put out about anything, and she always rubbed it the same way, so that it was crooked, and leaned a little in her brown, wrinkled face like a mast that has heen tilted in a storm. A tall woman prematurely aged appeared in the door of the house across the fence. Her skirts were also tucked up, her shoes were wet. Her dress was open in front.

Because woman is specialised for home work, these wider responsibilities for individual growth have, in a large measure, become hers also. The home as a social organisation stands as an agent of help or hindrance midway between the well established theories of the scientists concerning human welfare, on the one hand, and society, on the other, where the finished product of personality asserts itself as a social force.	Thus, the woman, as the central figure in the home, becomes the primary educator and influencer, molding the nascent characters of those within her care. Her influence is profound and far-reaching, extending beyond the immediate confines of the household and into the broader social fabric. The responsibilities she bears are not merely domestic but are deeply intertwined with the cultivation of ethical and emotional capacities in the young.  In this role, she is not merely a caretaker but a cultivator of human potential, a steward of the next generation's capacity to engage thoughtfully and compassionately with the world. This immense task requires a keen understanding of individual needs and a judicious application of encouragement and discipline. It is through her efforts that the foundational aspects of personality—such as empathy, resilience, and moral reasoning—are nurtured. Moreover, the home environment, shaped significantly by her hands, serves as the first school of social interaction where foundational social skills are learned and practiced. The norms, values, and behaviors imparted within the home set the stage for all future social engagements. Hence, the quality of the home	1911	2003.6677
But the most gratifying feature of practical progress during the past year has been the steady introduction of more scientific methods of educating the public in lighting matters. A notable instance of improvement in this direction is furnished by the advance in much of the literature issued to the public. We may here mention the well got up publication of Holophane Ltd., in which much practical information is given on the best methods of using Holophane globes and reflectors to obtain themostefficient results with the different illuminants available. The photography of artificially lighted interiors is developing into a fine art, and vastly improved results can now be secured compared  with those commonly presented only two or three years ago. To sum up, therefore, the signs of progress during the preceding year have been distinctly encouraging. The outlook for the next is equally bright, and we hope that by the beginning of 1913 there will again be solid progress to report.	The growing appreciation for the scientific approach in lighting technology is evident not only in the enhanced quality of educational materials but also in the increasing involvement of experts in the field. Engineers and physicists are now more than ever engaged in the development and refinement of lighting solutions. This collaboration has led to the introduction of new standards and metrics for evaluating light quality, such as color rendering index and luminous efficacy, which are critical for both commercial and residential settings. Moreover, the expansion of electric lighting in urban and rural areas continues to transform daily life. Street lighting, once a luxury in many places, is becoming more common, enhancing safety and extending productive hours after sunset. Additionally, the introduction of more durable and efficient light bulbs is reducing the frequency of replacements, which is a boon for both the environment and consumer wallets. In the realm of public education, seminars and workshops conducted by lighting professionals are becoming widespread, helping to disseminate knowledge about the benefits of proper lighting and how to achieve it. These educational efforts are complemented by exhibitions and fairs where manufacturers display the latest innovations in lighting technology. As we move forward	1912	2003.3411
"The Bishops bar it, but in private chapels like our own, or Blackmount, they can't interfere. To me, yesterday evening"" — his voice fell — ""it was like the gate of heaven. I longed to have you there."" She made no reply. Her brow knitted a little. He went on: ""Of course a great deal of what is done at places like Blackmount is not recognised — yet. To some of the services — to Benediction, for instance — the public is not admitted. But the brothers keep every rule — of the strictest observance. I was present last night at the recitation of the Night Office — most touching! — most solemn! and — my darling!"""	"He reached for her hand, his voice trembling with the fervor of his emotions. ""It was a moment that seemed to lift the soul beyond the bounds of the earthly, into a communion with the divine. Such peace, such profound, engulfing peace—it was as though all the troubles of the world were locked outside, and there within those sacred walls, nothing could touch us."" Her eyes met his, reflecting a tumult of feelings. ""I understand—I truly do,"" she said softly, yet there was a trace of hesitation in her tone. ""But you know my father's views on these matters. He sees such practices as too removed from the simplicity of our faith. And the bishop's position—"" ""Yes, I know,"" he interrupted, gently squeezing her hand. ""But remember, love, that faith is also about finding your own path to the divine. What touched my heart in that chapel might not be for everyone, but it spoke to me in a way that I cannot ignore. I wish I could share that with you, with no reservations, no barriers."" She sighed,"	1913	1919.7042
"Physicians from clinical observation had long  231 decided in the affirmative [as to whether the gastric glands have secretory enervation] and looked upon the existence of secretory nerves of the stomach as undoubted. . . . Physiologists, on the other hand, had for decades fruitlessly endeavoured to arrive at definite results upon this subject. It is a striking, but by no means isolated, instance where the physician arrives at a correct verdict upon physiological processes earlier than the physiologist himself; nor is it indeed strange."" The question of the pain necessarily involved in vivisection is very seldom fairly met by apologists for the practice. Yet it lies at the root of the controversy. Dr. Wachenheim in his remarks upon pain says: ""To understand what pain is, we unfortunately must cause it."""	The statement embodies a grim irony that underscores the ethical dilemma inherent in such studies. The pursuit of knowledge, especially in the realms of physiology and medicine, often treads a fine line between necessity and morality. Dr. Wachenheim further elaborates that the sensation of pain, while undeniably distressing and undesirable, serves as a crucial indicator of physiological responses and conditions that, if left unexplored, could hinder medical advancement significantly. This justification, however, does not fully address the moral concerns raised by those opposed to vivisection. They argue that inflicting pain, regardless of the potential benefits in terms of scientific insight or future medical breakthroughs, is inherently inhumane and unethical. The debate thus revolves not only around the scientific necessity of such practices but also the ethical frameworks within which they are conducted. To mediate between these opposing views, some have proposed stricter regulations and the implementation of alternative methods where possible. The development of non-invasive imaging technologies, computer modeling, and other innovative approaches could potentially reduce the reliance on animal testing and vivisection. Yet, as of now	1911	1998.2911
If all this is to be reached, the teacher must subordinate the work throughout to such a purposive interpretation. Human individualities in their life blood and in the fullness of their will must always stand in the centre. The form must be that of the narration which interprets the purposes, never that of the description which sticks to the external facts. Dates and names must be subordinated, the relations between human personalities must be in the foreground, in short the mental function to which the history lesson should appeal is the sympathising will which understands men by sharing their intentions.	This approach transforms the study of history into a dynamic and engaging process, where students are not mere recipients of information but active participants in the unfolding narrative of humanity. Through this method, the past is brought to life as a series of motivations and actions, allowing students to see historical figures not as distant icons, but as real people with desires and decisions that resonate with their own experiences. By emphasizing the motives and decisions behind historical events, the teacher fosters a deeper understanding and a more personal connection to the material. This not only aids in retention but also cultivates critical thinking skills as students analyze the causes and effects of different actions, and consider how different choices might have led to different outcomes. Moreover, such a teaching strategy encourages empathy and ethical reasoning, as students consider the moral dimensions of historical events. They learn to appreciate the complexity of human behavior and the often challenging moral landscapes that people in the past navigated. This, in turn, prepares them to face their own moral and ethical decisions with a more nuanced perspective. Ultimately, the goal is to develop not just a student's knowledge of history,	1909	2007.5006
"They indicate how far some Canadian farmers are willing to go in tax reform. Progressive Land Taxes The Federal Government of Australia has brought into operation an act to tax all land above the value of $25,000. This tax increases progressively as the amount of land owned by an individual or company is over certain values; for instance, the rate on a holding worth $100,000 is higher than the rate on a holding worth $50,000. This progressive taxation of lands, however, is working out as might be expected. Either the law is evaded by nominal subdivision of estates among members of a family, or the estate is broken up by sale into portions too small to be reached by this form of taxation. Land Values as Community Losses ""I was at a meeting of our volunteer fire department, the other evening, "" said Smith, ""and at it we disposed of 'concessions' at a fair we are going to hold during several evenings upon fenced grounds. One Jones offered $50 for the privilege of exclusively selling cigars, and we promptly accepted his offer. We wrote out a contract."	"Then someone raised a question about whether we should have allowed competitive bidding, but old Jones, he's a shrewd one, knew we'd just take the first decent offer that came our way. This got me thinking about how we handle land values in our community. It's similar to how we just handed Jones that concession without thinking much about it. We're letting people snap up land, which really belongs to the community, without ensuring it benefits everyone."" ""As land values increase, that's wealth that's created not just by the individual who owns the land, but by the entire community. The roads, the schools, the local services that we all pay for boost the value of that land. And yet, when that land is sold, the community doesn't see a penny of that increase. It's a community loss, not just because we could be generating revenue from that increase to fund public services, but also because it contributes to greater inequality."" Smith continued, ""If we treated land values as community assets, much like we handle concessions at our fair, we could ensure that the benefits of"	1911	2006.0896
Some machines fly at the angle of minimum drift, in which case the force is Z, and ft QQg Q Xw = - — jj — , and varies from 0-2 to 0-7. If flying at the angle of maximum lift/drift for the whole machine, then the variation of drift for a given change of angle is from Jth to those the variation of lift — ie., of Zq. Hence for actual flying machines, Xm may be expected to lie between 0 and 0*4, and depends largely on the wings, but to some extent on the body resistance of the machine. Mk Variation of pitching moment with normal velocity.	The pitching moment, denoted as M, is influenced directly by changes in the normal velocity, V, which affects the airspeed and angle of attack on the aircraft wings. This relationship can be expressed as M = Cm * 0.5 * ρ * V^2 * S * c, where Cm represents the pitching moment coefficient, ρ is the air density, S is the wing area, and c is the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing. The coefficient Cm is particularly sensitive to changes in the angle of attack. As the angle of attack increases, the lift coefficient, Cl, increases until it reaches a maximum point before it starts to decrease due to stall. Correspondingly, the pitching moment coefficient generally becomes more negative, indicating a nose-down tendency which helps prevent the aircraft from stalling by reducing the angle of attack. This characteristic is crucial for maintaining stability, especially during maneuvers that involve changes in velocity and altitude. Furthermore, the distribution of lift across the wings can significantly impact the pitching moment. If the center of pressure moves forward, it can lead to a	1912	1978.2734

It was a wonderful sight, that plunge into the life giving stream, that rush from the bank of glistering, sunlit figures, into the strange little yellow green river. But though so many went in at the dipping of the holy cross, their elimination from the numbers on the banks only served to show how many more were waiting behind. For a whole hour there was a scene that baffles description, the most extraordinary mingling of men and  415 I suppose some pilgrims went into the water with their money tied to their bodies, others left it in charge of some other pilgrim on the shore, though most must have simply left it in the heaps with their shed clothing.	The air was filled with their fervent prayers and exclamations, a cacophony of hope and devotion that resonated deeply with anyone within earshot. Children clung to their parents, their eyes wide with a mixture of fear and awe as they watched the adults' ritualistic immersion. Elderly folks, supported by relatives or kind strangers, made their way slowly into the water, their faces etched with lines of pain and expectation, hoping for relief or a miracle. As each person emerged from the river, there was a palpable change in their demeanor. Some raised their hands skyward, others wept openly, while many more repeated their prayers, their voices stronger, infused with renewed faith. The clothes left on the bank seemed to form a patchwork quilt of the community's diverse fabric—rich hues and faded tones, each piece telling a story of life somewhere else, brought here to this sacred site. The scene was not just a spiritual spectacle but also a vivid tapestry of humanity in its most vulnerable and profound state. Observers could not help but feel a stirring within,	1913	2003.8586
"He came to a stop in front of Tony, as though at a loss suddenly for what to say or do. He looked around at all of us, but not at Tony. The tense and awkward silence lasted for many seconds. It was the younger man who broke it. "" Well — I'M back."" Man'el shuddered, seemed to look over our heads at the girl standing alone across the street, then turned and held out his arms mechanically, as though the gesture had been rehearsed many times. ""My boy — my boy — my boy!"""	"His voice was choked with emotion, and his eyes, once they finally met Tony's, were brimming with tears. Tony, hesitant at first, took a step forward, his own face a mix of confusion and longing. The street seemed to hold its breath, the usual noises fading into a distant murmur. As father and son embraced, the years of separation melted away, leaving behind the raw, unspoken feelings that had accumulated like dust in an old, forgotten room.

Outside ‘proof of its meaning is not admissible, — its construction is for the court alone.‘ Whether certain correspondence constitutes a contract, and its proper construction as such, are for the court 127. The Intention of Parties should Control. — In the construction of instruments or contracts the ﬁrst rule to be regarded is to follow the intention of the parties as gathered from the entire transaction, and by looking at all the provisions of the instrument, and not one alone. All other rules are subordinate to this one, and when they contravene it they are to be disregarded. If the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous, parol evidence is not allowable to ascertain the pretext of the parties thereto.	However, where the terms are vague or ambiguous, or where there exists a dispute as to the parties' true intent, external evidence may be introduced to clarify the meaning. This includes the conduct of the parties before and after the agreement was made, as well as any relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction. Courts strive to enforce the contract in a manner that is consistent with the mutual understanding of the parties at the time of the agreement. It is also pertinent to consider, in cases of ambiguity, the principle of contra proferentem, which dictates that any unclear term within a contract should be interpreted against the interests of the party that provided the wording. This rule helps to mitigate the problems arising from inequalities of bargaining power and expertise. Furthermore, in interpreting a contract, courts may refer to established principles of equity and good faith. These principles compel parties to act honestly and not to use the terms of the contract to achieve an unconscionable result. This overarching duty can influence the interpretation of contract terms and the performance expected of each party. Thus, while the written words of a contract are critical, they	1913	1947.6815
A Discussion on Direct, Semi indirect, and Indirect Lighting. As indirect lighting is to be the subject of a paper by Mr. W. H. Willcox and Mr. H. C. Wheat at the meeting of the Illuminating Engineering Society in London on December 3rd, it is of interest to notice that a discussion on this subject was arranged by the American Illuminating Engineering Society, and appeared in the June number of the Transactions. The method was adopted of inviting three separate papers by Messrs. T. W. Rolph, J. G. Henninger, and J. G. Hibben respectively on these systems. The three papers together represent a useful and complete analysis of the subject, to which we shall have occasion to refer again shortly. A good feature is the presentation of polar curves of light distribution of the various units — a piece of information which has not been often presented.	The discussion that followed the presentation of these papers was particularly enlightening, focusing on the practical applications and limitations of each lighting method. Mr. Rolph, in his paper on direct lighting, emphasized the benefits of this approach for tasks requiring high visibility and focus, such as reading or intricate assembly work. He noted, however, that direct lighting can produce harsh shadows and glare, which may lead to eye strain and fatigue over extended periods. Mr. Henninger, discussing semi-indirect lighting, highlighted its ability to reduce glare and provide a more diffused light that is easier on the eyes. This method combines both direct and indirect lighting elements, allowing for more balanced illumination that can be suitable for both work and general ambient lighting in spaces like offices and classrooms. Nonetheless, he pointed out that the efficiency of semi-indirect lighting can sometimes be lower than direct lighting, as some of the light is lost in the diffusion process. Mr. Hibben’s exposition on indirect lighting praised its capacity to create a soft, evenly distributed light that minimizes shadows and glare, making it ideal for creating a relaxed atmosphere suitable	1912	1999.153
This means that the nearer to earth's surface an animal lives, the larger will be the proportion of neighbours he detects by seeing them dark against the sky. Only such neighbours as are no taller than he will escape coming between him and his sky. After years of trying to bring home to naturalists this great fact, which wholly suffices to account for white top patterns in general, I know to my sorrow that nothing short of seizing them all and binding them to the ground, so that their eyes will be as low as a mouse's, will ever cause the truth to spring into vital existence for them! I have demonstrated to many audiences on both sides of the Atlantic where scarcely one man would consent actually to go down on the turf and let this immense fact rush upon his consciousness. Everywhere, in every situation, it is the rule that animals are coloured like the background that most concerns their feeding and escaping attack.	Hence the prevalence of greens and browns in the coats of many ground-dwelling creatures, blending them into the forest floor or grassy plains where they hunt or hide. Similarly, creatures of the desert are often sand-colored, allowing them to vanish against the vast stretches of dunes and rocks. In the arctic zones, the whiteness of the polar bear or the arctic fox renders them nearly invisible against the snow and ice, enhancing their ability to approach prey or evade predators. In aquatic environments, many fishes and marine mammals show a dark back and a lighter belly, a coloration known as countershading. From above, their dark backs merge with the deeper, darker waters; viewed from below, their light bellies blend with the light filtering down from the surface. This dual deception protects them from predators and prey alike, demonstrating nature's ingenious adaptations to the visual challenges posed by different environments. Such protective coloration is a testament to the relentless pressures of natural selection, driving species to ever more refined strategies to survive and thrive. The subtleties of these adaptations often escape	1911	2007.0833

The gospel according to Weininger will have it that Joan of Arc was immeasurably inferior to the vile theologians who condemned her; that the heroic love of Heloise was a mere blend of concupiscence and vanity; that Dante, in his worship of Beatrice, devoted life and genius to the celebration of a phantom; that the heroic slave girl of Lyons, who smilingly endured the tortures and infamies of the amphitheatre, was upborne not by spiritual ardour, but by hysterical exaltation. Merely to state such hypotheses is ample refutation; words fail me to express the scorn with which I reject this caricature of philosophy. The fact is that, little as we know of the lineaments and signs that betolfcn spirituality, we do know — it has been an open secret in all ages — that in some inscrutable way woman stands nearer than man to the threshold of divine reality. Not mere definiteness of form or hardness of material can guarantee the self sufficing entity of a given phenomenon.	The spiritual essence, often more vividly expressed in what might seem the weaker vessel, transcends these superficial attributes. Weininger, in his critique, neglects the profound intuition and the intrinsic value of the feminine spirit, which history has repeatedly illustrated through figures of immense moral and spiritual strength. Indeed, the capacity to endure, to nurture, and to inspire, which these women epitomized, springs from a depth of soul that mere rational analysis cannot fathom. One must consider the broader canvas of human experience, where the interplay of strength and sensitivity sketches the true contours of greatness. The spiritual fortitude of these women does not derive from the transient waves of emotion, but from a steady, enduring flame of inner conviction. Their actions and sacrifices illuminate the landscape of human progress, not as mere footnotes in a patriarchal narrative, but as central chapters in our collective moral evolution. Thus, to dismiss or diminish their contributions as Weininger attempts, based on a narrow and mechanistic view of human psychology, is to overlook the essence of what makes us truly human: the ability to transcend our	1911	1897.7198

These figures, when analyzed, present a clear picture of the consumption trends over different time periods and geographical areas. The data, meticulously recorded in grams, reveals both the consistency and fluctuations inherent to the subject at hand. To further elucidate, the 'Sg.' notation likely refers to specific measurements or batches, each uniquely identified to ensure precise tracking and comparison. The variances between the numbers, such as those between '37-8g.' and '38-5K.', suggest subtle differences in either the method of measurement, the conditions of measurement, or inherent qualities of the items being measured. This detailed tabulation serves as an invaluable tool for researchers and analysts who are tasked with interpreting these nuances and deriving meaningful insights from the raw data. Further investigation into each specific entry could uncover patterns or anomalies that may influence broader studies or applications.

But the tendency to adaptation has, so far, been developed only on a small scale. There does not seem to be a general movement of sufficient momentum to encourage the belief that the Jew, forgetting his race and remembering only the essential principles of his religion, will finally arrive at the goal of complete racial amalgamation. True, there is a marked tendency among the adherents of reformed Judaism in the United States to bury the antiquated customs of the past and to become real Americans, but this reformed Judaism hardly has time to make itself felt before it is dealt a killing blow by the mere force of numbers in the opposite ranks. In other words, the old ideas from the ghettos of Europe are imported so rapidly that the new has but a poor chance to gain sufficient adherents to keep pace with, and finally outstrip, the old superstitions. And this thought brings us to the final conclusion of the whole matter, and that is, whatever the race of people from which the immigrant comes, the final result is not to be feared so long as he does not come in overwhelming numbers.	The fundamental issue, then, is one of balance and integration, not of exclusion or assimilation to the point of cultural erasure. The capacity for any society to absorb new influences, including those from immigrant populations, hinges on its ability to maintain a healthy equilibrium where new customs and ideas can be accommodated within the existing social fabric without causing disruption. This does not necessarily mean that the incoming population must completely abandon their heritage, but rather that there should be an open, mutual exchange between the old and the new. This exchange allows for the evolution of a society that honors its past while still moving forward. Hence, the challenge lies not only with the immigrant community in adapting to their new environment but equally with the host society in being receptive to the enriching aspects of cultural diversity. Education and public policy play pivotal roles in facilitating this process, ensuring that integration does not become a force of division but a means of enriching the collective national identity. Through such measures, the fears surrounding the dilution of cultural identity or the preservation of racial purity are mitigated, leading to a more inclusive and adaptive	1911	2006.6083

Martha Dawe seized his arm and pressed half a sovereign into his hand. "" I couldn't a bear to see you starvin', Mister Dick!"" The coin dropped out of his hand on to the ground. She picked it up and offered it to him. He shook his head, and tears welled in her eyes. "" Come along into Lockhart's, "" she urged. "" It's the only place this time of the mornin'."" Some soft influence suffused his being, and he followed her. "" I ought not, "" he stammered."	"""But I suppose it's no harm just this once."" Martha smiled through her tears, a mixture of relief and maternal tenderness lighting up her features. ""That's right, Mister Dick. A bit of warm food will do you good, it will."" They entered the warm glow of Lockhart's, the smell of fresh coffee and baked bread enveloping them like a comforting shroud. Martha led the way to a small table tucked away in a cozy corner. She ordered two cups of coffee and some hearty sandwiches, insisting despite Dick's faint protests. As they waited, she watched him with an intense yet caring gaze, as if trying to stitch his troubles away with her eyes. Dick fidgeted, uncomfortable under her scrutiny yet grateful for the company.

(20) This expression provides a critical insight into the distribution of stress and bending moments within the structure under examination. By analyzing these equations, one can discern the relationship between the applied loads, the geometrical properties of the section, and the resulting response in terms of stress distribution and deformation characteristics. Further analysis of the equations and substitution into the boundary conditions can reveal additional insights into the behavior of the structure under various loading scenarios. For instance, if we consider the boundary conditions where the ends of the beam or structure are fixed, additional terms may need to be considered in the equations, potentially altering the solution and hence the interpretation of the results. Additionally, if we extend our analysis to include the effects of shear forces and torsional moments, equations (14) and (16) might be expanded to include these factors, providing a more comprehensive model of the structural response. This could be particularly relevant in scenarios where the load is not purely axial or where the geometry of the structure is such that torsional and shear effects are non-negligible.

Or I may consider this tree from an economic point of view with reference to its value as wood for the fireplace, or from a practical point of view as a fit place for my hammock. In this way we may easily change attitudes. And yet, is it not a well-known experience that attitudes become habitual and that training in one kind almost excludes or at least somewhat inhibits other kinds? Since the painter has trained his eye to see the trees from an aesthetic viewpoint and the naturalist has trained himself in the botanical attitude, it is most improbable that the painter will easily go over to the scientific view of trees or vice versa. But this suggests a grave problem.	How can we ensure that our specialized trainings do not become limitations, blinding us to the rich multiplicity of the world? How can we cultivate a flexibility of mind that allows us to shift perspectives without losing the depth that specialization affords? This issue is not merely academic but touches upon the very way we engage with and understand our environment. It raises questions about education and professional training: should they aim to produce specialists, highly skilled in one narrow field, or polymaths, with a broader though perhaps shallower understanding across multiple domains? The challenge is to find a balance, to train minds that are both deep and wide, capable of appreciating the aesthetic beauty of a landscape while understanding its ecological significance, its economic value, and its cultural symbolism. Such a holistic approach encourages a richer engagement with the world, promoting a deeper understanding and a more thoughtful interaction with our surroundings. It suggests an educational model that does not merely fill minds with facts but encourages the development of a flexible, integrative way of thinking that can navigate and appreciate the complexities of modern life.	1909	2005.8368
"Most travellers when ready to sail from a country would have swallowed their wrath at the loss of a favourite ox or would have retaliated blunderingly. By putting himself under the command of a Hottentot chief with his band, with the stipulation that a flogging was to be the only punishment of the Damara miscreants, Mr. Galton at once turned the annoying incident into a golden opportunity of studying the tactics of a savage raid. Francis Galton by his studies of noteworthy men of science found that no special education other than self instruction is really necessary to the attainment of eminence. Access to superior tuition and laboratories have doubtless helped some to attain distinction who could not otherwise have done so, but they are by no means all important factors. ""The facts that lie patent before the eyes of every medical man, engineer and the members of most professions, afford ample material for researches that would command the attention of the scientific world if viewed with intelligence and combined by a capable mind."""	Galton's observations led him to conclude that the most significant factor in the development of a scientist was not the formal education received, but rather the personal initiative and curiosity that drove them to explore and understand the world around them. He argued that the traits of observation, analysis, and synthesis are often found naturally in individuals, and these traits can lead to significant scientific contributions regardless of the level of formal education.  This perspective was revolutionary at the time, suggesting that the potential for scientific achievement could be found across different strata of society, provided there was sufficient motivation and curiosity. Galton's views also hinted at the importance of a supportive environment that encourages independent thought and exploration, rather than a rigid educational structure that might stifle creativity. Moreover, Galton's emphasis on the role of self-instruction and personal exploration in scientific achievement has implications for how we understand and foster talent today. It suggests that education systems and policies should focus more on nurturing curiosity and critical thinking skills, rather than merely transmitting knowledge. This approach could potentially unlock the scientific potential of many more individuals who might otherwise remain undiscovered within	1911	1995.8906

We are confident that no man ever yet received a money gift from another without a sense of degradation and a loss of self respect. Of course, custom hardens, and each successive gift imparts a fainter throe; the sting of shame is dulled more and more to the calloused soul, but it is always the sting of shame. We do not believe it possible for a man earning an honest living to take money which he has not earned without the misery which even the mendicant must know from alms.	This sentiment, deeply ingrained in the human spirit, is what makes the concept of charity so complex and fraught with moral ambiguity. To give is noble, but to receive is often to wrestle with inner demons of pride and worthiness. The gift, intended to alleviate burden, paradoxically can add an invisible weight—the burden of obligation and dependency. It is for this reason that many advocate for systems of aid that empower rather than simply provide. The ideal form of assistance, according to this view, is one that enables the recipient to eventually stand on their own, to restore their sense of agency and dignity that true independence brings. Furthermore, the act of receiving unearned money can create a perilous psychological divide, separating one from the wholesome satisfaction derived from self-sufficiency. It is a universal truth that the joy of earning, of reaping the fruits of one's labor, is among the most satisfying of human experiences. This joy is diminished, if not altogether extinguished, when the fruits are unearned, handed over without the sweet labor that should precede them. Thus, while the	1913	2003.1576
"I am quite convinced that, in deciding to remain behind on the planet, the Professor, as M'Allister remarked, "" did the right thing"" ; but after the many years we have spent together in the closest and truest friendship, I miss him — ah, more than I can say. 302  It was really a tremendous wrench, that parting with my two old friends, the Professor and Merna, and leaving them behind on Mars, although I fully appreciated the Professor's desire to end his days with his dear son, to whom he had been so strangely reunited. We started that morning directly after our farewell, and found a large concourse of people assembled, who had come from all parts of the planet to see us off. Soranho and many other high officers of state whom we knew were present, and, of course, the Professor, Merna, Eleeta, and Siloni, as well as many others whom we had come to regard as personal friends; and they did not allow us to depart emptyhanded."	"Gifts of all sorts were pressed upon us—rich fabrics woven from the fine silks of Martian flora, intricate pieces of artistry in metal and stone, rare books filled with the knowledge and history of Mars, and even small, delicate plants to remind us of the Martian gardens. Each item was a token of friendship and esteem, a way to keep the memory of our time on Mars alive even as we journeyed back to Earth. As the spacecraft’s engines began to hum with the promise of departure, a solemn hush fell over the crowd. The air was thick with emotion, and even the usually stoic Martian faces showed signs of melancholy. The Professor stepped forward, his eyes glistening with unshed tears, and embraced each of us tightly. ""Remember,"" he whispered, ""the universe is vast, but our hearts are connected across the stars. We are always with you, no matter the distance."" Merna, with her usual grace, offered us a small, beautifully crafted compass. ""To guide you home,"" she said softly, ""and to guide you back to us"	1911	1978.5643

The solution is then cooled to a low temperature, which causes the stearic acid to precipitate due to its lower solubility in cold alcohol, while the palmitic acid remains dissolved. The precipitated stearic acid can be filtered off, and the filtrate containing the palmitic acid can then be evaporated under reduced pressure to recover the palmitic acid in a relatively pure form. This method, while simple in principle, requires careful control of temperature and concentration to ensure effective separation. It is also important to ensure that the alcohol used is of high purity, as impurities can affect the solubility of the acids and thus the efficiency of the separation process. Once isolated, the palmitic acid can be further purified if necessary by recrystallization or other standard techniques in organic chemistry, depending on the specific requirements of the application for which it is intended.	1913	1979.348

Miss Glenwilliam stood as well, brushing off her skirt with a nonchalant air. ""Oh, but life is dreadfully dull without a little danger, don't you think?

Make into balls and store for use. This wax should be warmed when applied. If it is too hard, more tallow and less resin may be used. Some propagators use linseed oil instead of tallow. The linseed oil should be pure. If adulterated with cottonseed oil, the wax becomes very stringy and difficult to handle. Clay is frequently used for covering wounds made by grafting, and it gives quite as good results as any of the waxes, if properly applied, but is not so convenient. For this purpose some very tenacious clay should be used, and it is thought to be improved when mixed with about one third fresh cow dung and a little plasterer's hair. The whole mass should be thoroughly worked over and kneaded before using. Cleft grafting is very common and more universally known and used than any other. It is commonly performed to change the variety of apple, plum and various other trees and plants. It is generally the most practical method to use on branches one or two inches in diameter or larger, but it also works well on small stocks.	The process involves making a vertical split in the stock, usually about two to three inches deep, and then inserting a scion, which is a cutting from another plant that you wish to propagate. The scion should have at least two or three buds and be shaped to a wedge at the base to fit snugly into the cleft. Care must be taken to ensure that the cambium layer of the scion aligns closely with the cambium layer of the stock, as this is crucial for successful grafting. Once the scion is inserted, the split should be bound tightly with grafting tape or waxed cloth to prevent desiccation and to hold the scion in place while the graft heals. Over time, typically over the course of a season, the tissues of the stock and scion will grow together, forming a union. It is critical during this period to maintain adequate moisture and to protect the graft from extreme temperatures and pests. After the graft has taken and the union is strong, the binding can be carefully removed, and the grafted plant can continue to grow, eventually	1914	1976.7087
"The phenomenon of the slow growth of a strain under a steady tensile stress has been called ""creeping"" by Prof. Ewing. On account of the part which takes time to develop, the total amount of strain produced by a given load and the shape of the stress strain curve will be slightly modified by the rate of loading. At D, just before the greatest load is reached, the material is almost perfectly plastic, the tensile strain increasing greatly for very slight increase of load. It should be noted that in this diagram both stress intensity and strain are reckoned on the original dimensions of the material. During the ductile elongation, the area of cross section decreases in practically the same proportion that the length increases, or in other words, the volume of the material remains practically unchanged. The reduction in area of section is generally fairly uniform along the bar."	As the test progresses and the material approaches its ultimate tensile strength, the rate of elongation tends to accelerate until it reaches a point known as necking. At this stage, the uniformity of the cross-sectional reduction ceases, and the material begins to thin more significantly at a localized area. This localized reduction in cross-section leads to an increase in stress concentration within the necked region, which, in turn, exacerbates the material deformation at this point. The stress-strain curve, which initially showed a proportional relationship between stress and strain in the elastic region, begins to curve more significantly as it enters the plastic region, indicating that the material is undergoing permanent deformation. The curve reaches its peak at the ultimate tensile strength, beyond which the material will experience a drop in stress as it approaches fracture. The concept of true stress and true strain becomes important in this phase of the testing. True stress is calculated based on the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen rather than the original area, and true strain is calculated based on the instantaneous length. These adjustments are crucial for accurately describing the material behavior	1908	1997.3177

the three primitive categories of instinct, and remain stumbling blocks in the way of generalising the conduct of man. The conception of man as a gregarious animal is, of course, extremely familiar; one frequently meets with it in the writings of psychologists and sociologists and it has obtained a respectable currency with the lay public. It has indeed become so hackneyed that it is the first duty of a writer who maintains the thesis that its significance is not even yet fully understood, to show that the popular conception of it has been far from exhaustive. As used hitherto the idea seems to have had a certain vagueness which greatly impaired its practical value.	It has often been employed more as a rhetorical flourish than as a precise analytical tool. The term 'gregarious' has been applied to human society with a broad brush, glossing over the intricate variations and complexities of social behavior. It is not enough to label mankind as gregarious; we must delve deeper into the specific mechanisms and manifestations of this gregariousness. To begin with, the gregarious instinct in humans is not merely a passive tendency to flock together but an active and dynamic force that shapes much of human culture and interpersonal relations. It influences everything from the formation of social hierarchies and the development of language to the creation of laws and the arts. This instinct is also modulated by other psychological factors such as aggression, fear, and love, which can either reinforce or counteract the basic gregarious impulse. Moreover, the expression of gregariousness varies greatly across different cultures and historical periods. In some societies, it manifests as a strong emphasis on community and collective welfare, while in others, individualism prevails but still within a framework that necessitates social	1908	2005.8597

The diagram of bending moments is shown in the lower part of Fig. 136. The serious changes in the magnitude of the bending moments at B, C, and under the 6 tonne load may be noted; also the change in position of the points of inflexion to the right and left of C, involving change in signs of the bending moment over some length of the beam : all these changes arise from the slight subsidence of the two supports at B and C. 91. Continuous Beams of Varying Section.	When dealing with continuous beams where the section of the beam varies along its length, the analysis becomes more complex. The variation in section affects the moment of inertia, which in turn influences the distribution of bending moments and shear forces along the beam. In such cases, it is essential to consider each segment of the beam separately, taking into account the different properties of each section. To analyze a continuous beam of varying section, the following steps are typically followed: 1. **Divide the Beam into Segments**: Each segment corresponds to a section of the beam with uniform properties. 2. **Determine Support Reactions**: Using the conditions of equilibrium, calculate the reactions at the supports. This may require solving a system of equations if there are multiple supports. 3. **Calculate Moments and Shear Forces**: For each segment, apply the basic principles of bending moment and shear force. This involves integrating the load distribution if it varies along the length of the beam. 4. **Check for Continuity Requirements**: At points where the section changes, ensure that both bending moment and shear force are continuous across the interface	1908	1990.8195

This was one of the names that father was fond of calling him; and though Tam did not altogether like it, he decided to make no protest on this occasion.

The Judge smiled down at his children, his heart swelling with pride and affection. ""I believe you both could,"" he responded warmly. ""It's a fine thing to have such willing helpers at home. But remember, the best way to help your mother is by being good and doing your tasks without being told."" Charlie nodded solemnly, taking his responsibilities as the eldest child seriously.

Olive chimed in, her imagination already picturing the bright blooms that would bring a smile to their mother's face. The Judge ruffled Tam's hair affectionately and then did the same to Charlie and Olive. ""Very well, my little caretakers,"" he said, his voice tinged with gentle humor and deep affection.

We are informed that the word comes from the Persian mythology surrounding the religion of Zoroaster — the worship of the sun, the God of Light. Briefly, the story is this : the ancient Magii of the East held that human affairs were ruled by two deities, or principles. One is Ahuru Mazda, the author of all good, eternally absorbed in light ; the other, Angro Mainyush, the origin of all evil, dwelling in perpetual darkness. These two powers are engaged in a long and terrible conflict, and the prize of the victor is to be the collective soul of man. Mazda created man free, so that if he allows himself to fall under the sway of the swart and malevolent Angro he may justly be punished. According to this mythology, Mazda must triumph ultimately, and there will then be one undivided kingdom of light in heaven and earth, •  THE ILLUMINATING ENGINEER.	It is from this dualistic cosmology that the concept of eternal struggle between good and evil, light and darkness, has permeated many cultures and religions, influencing a myriad of spiritual and philosophical doctrines across the globe. The Magii, or Magi, were not only priests and custodians of this sacred knowledge but also astronomers and scholars, guiding their people through the spiritual and literal darkness by their understanding of the heavens and the movements of the celestial bodies. This eternal conflict is reflected in the rituals and the moral teachings of Zoroastrianism, emphasizing the importance of personal choice in the cosmic battle. Followers are urged to live lives of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, aligning themselves with Ahura Mazda and resisting the temptations of Angra Mainyu. The fire temple, an essential element of Zoroastrian worship, symbolizes the light of wisdom, truth, and goodness, continually fighting against the darkness of ignorance and evil. Thus, the ancient Persian mythology serves as a profound allegory for the human condition, encapsulating the universal theme of the battle between light	1912	1980.974
(4) Its climate made it an ideal place for a winter resort and its situation on the bay insured many summer tourists. (5) It was thought that Southern sentiment might be more hospitable than that in the North to the innovation contemplated in our plan. (6) And last, but not least, the purchase price of the land was conveniently inconsiderable. The future land values which we confidently expected to develop would show by contrast the merit of our plan. In none of the points abovementioned have we found occasion to regret our choice.	The developments that followed were indeed most encouraging. As the construction of the resort began, it became evident that the location possessed even more charm and potential than previously evaluated. The temperate climate ensured a steady flow of visitors seeking respite from the harsh winters of the north and the oppressive heat of the southern summers. The scenic vistas across the bay were an instant attraction, pulling in crowds who were equally enchanted by the serene landscapes and the quaint architecture that began to dot the area. The local populace, imbued with a spirit of southern hospitality, welcomed the influx of tourists and the opportunities they brought. This acceptance was crucial to the success of our project, which had introduced several modern conveniences and amenities previously unfamiliar to the region. The integration of these innovations was seamless, bolstered by the supportive attitude of the residents. Economically, the decision to purchase the land at a nominal price proved astute. As infrastructure improved and word of the charm and climate of the place spread, property values soared. Investors and new homeowners alike were eager to stake a claim in the burgeoning market, prompting a real estate	1911	1991.8715
"169. Typical General Testing Machines.

Tension. — Fig. 207 shows a side elevation of the machine in use for a tension test. When there is no pull on the test piece T, the travelling counterpoise or jockey weight P being at zero of the scale, the beam is just balanced on its knife edge fulcrum F, which rests on a hardened seating on the top of the main standard S. In this machine the straining is accomplished by admitting high pressure water through a controlling valve to a steel hydraulic cylinder H, the ram of which is rigidly 1 See Unwin's ""Testing of Materials, "" or Popplewell's ""Materials of Construction "" ; or for Continental machines see Marten's "" Handbook of Testing."" 2 For descriptions of American machines see Johnson's "" Materials of Construction."" 3 For descriptions see a paper on an electrically controlled machine in the Proc. Inst."	Civil Engineers. The ram is connected to the lower end of the test piece T by a clevis or similar attachment, ensuring that the force applied is axial and uniform across the specimen. As the hydraulic pressure increases, the ram moves upward, pulling the test piece and causing the lever to tilt. This tilt moves the jockey weight P along the beam scale, providing a measure of the force exerted. Compression. — For compression tests, the setup is slightly modified. The test specimen is placed between two platens, one fixed at the base of the machine and the other attached to the ram. As hydraulic pressure is applied, the ram moves downward, pushing against the upper platen and compressing the specimen. The force exerted causes the beam to tilt in the opposite direction compared to the tension test, and the jockey weight is adjusted accordingly to measure the force. Shear and Flexure Tests. — This machine can also be adapted for shear and flexure tests by changing the fixtures and the position of the test piece. For shear tests, the specimen is held between two grips and the	1908	1962.8158
The commencement of this type of motion can be traced from the stability equations for small disturbances, and the more general equations of motion are being examined with a view, if possible, to following the matter further. The work done, however, leads to the conclusion that probably all machines in common use suffer from this defect. Suggestions for remedying it are made, based on the experimental evidence, and these are generally in agreement with Bryan's proposals for the removal of lateral instability. The correction of this defect would appear to be at present the most difficult, and at the same time the most important of the problems connected with stability. The desired result can probably be secured by properly placed fins ; it would appear that care must be taken to avoid the use of too large a vertical rudder (for horizontal steering), and attention must be paid to the effect of covering in the fuselage, which produces the equivalent of fin area behind the centre of gravity of the machine.	In addition, the distribution of weight and the configuration of the wings play a critical role in maintaining stability. It is suggested that the wings should not only have a sufficient dihedral angle but also be positioned so that their aerodynamic center lies close to the machine's center of gravity. This arrangement helps in achieving a natural restoring moment in case of any lateral displacement.  Moreover, the introduction of ailerons for roll control is recommended. These devices allow for more precise adjustments in the wing's angle of attack on either side, providing a means to counteract unwanted roll movements effectively. The implementation of interconnected ailerons and rudder systems could further enhance the control, allowing for coordinated turns which minimize adverse yaw, thus improving the overall lateral stability. The aspect ratio of the wings also requires careful consideration. Longer wings with a higher aspect ratio tend to provide better lateral stability due to their increased roll inertia. However, this must be balanced with the need for adequate maneuverability and structural strength, as longer wings can be more susceptible to bending and require more robust construction. Finally, continuous experimental testing and validation	1912	1996.9869
Strangely enough, it is very well worth doing, for, though it is even more factitiously Moorish than the Alcazar, it is of almost as great beauty and of greater dignity. Gardens, galleries, staircases, statues, paintings, all are interesting, with a mingled air of care and neglect which is peculiarly charming, though perhaps the keener sensibilities, the morbider nerves may suffer from the glare and hardness of the tiling which render the place so wonderful and so exquisite. One must complain of something, and I complain of the tiling; I do not mind the house being supposed like the house of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem. It belongs to the Duke of Medina Celi, who no more comes to it from Madrid than the Duke of Alva comes to his house, which I somehow perversely preferred.	This preference, I admit, may seem capricious to those who prize architectural grandeur over the subtler qualities of atmosphere and history that a place exudes. The Duke of Alva's abode, less grand perhaps, whispers more insistently of the past, its walls echoing with the faint, ghostly reverberations of bygone eras. It is this intangible connection to history that often draws one more powerfully than the mere aesthetic appeal of a location. In the case of the Duke of Medina Celi's palace, its beauty is undeniable. The gardens are a labyrinth of green, punctuated by the vibrant colors of flowering plants, and the statues stand as silent sentinels of the past's artistic endeavors. The galleries are lined with paintings that capture moments of both tranquility and tumult, each canvas a window into the soul of the artist and the spirit of the age. Yet, it is the very perfection of the tiling, its glaring precision and the hard, unyielding surfaces, that impart a sense of sterility to the splendor. The tiles,	1913	1965.5912
"It is true that this matricide is not committed on the stage; but is it not shocking to hear the cries of Clytemnestra, calling JSgisthus to her aid, and attempting to excite the pity of a son by whose hand she will, in spite of all her submission, be butchered ? "" Such are the examples of the Masters of Art, and of those according to whose practice the rules were formed. What does Shakespeare, who knew not those rules P He shows us Hamlet filled with as much filial piety and determination to avenge his father's death as is Orestes in Sophocles. He gives him no less horror for his mother's crime, and increases it yet more by representing her as capable of incest."	Yet, unlike Orestes, Hamlet wavers, caught in the moral and psychological complexities of his situation. He is torn between action and inaction, a soul in anguish not just over the deed he must perform, but over the very nature of action itself. Shakespeare delves deep into the character's psyche, showing us a prince who is not just a revenger but a thinker, a philosopher, a poet troubled by the profoundest questions of existence and morality. Hamlet's delay, his feigned madness, his confrontations with Ophelia, his mother, and his murderous uncle, all serve to unfold layers of inner conflict far beyond the simple execution of a revenge plot. This depth of character exploration and moral ambiguity is something that sets Shakespeare apart from the classical tragedians. Where Sophocles' Orestes is driven by fate and duty, Shakespeare’s Hamlet wrestles with choice and free will. He questions the ghost’s demands, the ethics of vengeance, and the consequences of his actions not only on his soul but on the order of the kingdom. The ghost of	1912	1975.8954
On the contrary, there is naturally the most perfect union between the spirit and the senses, where the immediacy of the soul's creative activity blends with the immediacy of sense perception. Such integral union, which supposes man to have been originally under the complete guidance of instinct, could not have existed for any considerable period, for the simple reason that, unlike other animals, man was from the first thrown upon his own resources for protection against wild beasts; and as artifice was necessary for such defence, he was in this way soon launched upon his career as an artificer. This was a mere incident in the development of his mentality, followed by others that were prompted by necessity or choice, for his sustenance and comfort and for the rude beginnings of social order, whereby he grew away from all other animals and from the close precincts of instinct. It is impossible for us to regard so great a departure as wholly incidental; it was a destiny. But so long as the union remained intact, so long as man was under the guidance of instinct, he was as unmoral as Nature.	His morality, as it were, was not yet awakened; his actions, dictated by necessity, were neither good nor bad but merely natural. It was only as he evolved, as his consciousness expanded and he began to reflect upon his actions and their consequences, that he entered the realm of ethics and morality. This emergence from a purely instinctual existence into one governed by reason and reflection marks a significant pivot in the development of human civilization. The transition involved a complex interplay of factors. As man began to manipulate his environment through tools and developed rudimentary forms of communication, he also started to form larger social groups, which necessitated a more sophisticated understanding of interpersonal dynamics. The shift from instinct to reason didn't abolish the natural instincts but rather sublimated them, integrating them into a broader framework of social norms and moral judgments. This evolution brought about the concept of responsibility. Actions were no longer seen as merely survival tactics but were imbued with ethical weight. Decisions had to be justified not just on the basis of immediate efficacy but also on their long-term effects on others in the community. This	1913	1989.8474

His prostration after this second shock was so great that he could not be moved back to the hospital, and he spent the slow month of collapse and utter weakness which followed in his own bed in his own room under the care of two men nurses."	"During that grim period, his mind wandered ceaselessly. At times, he would speak to figures from his past, reliving conversations long since forgotten by others. At other moments, he would cry out in terror, his eyes wild with the fear of some unseen menace. His wife, though deeply shaken by the initial incident, returned to his side, her own distress buried beneath the weight of her concern for him. She sat by his bed, holding his hand, whispering words of comfort that seemed to reach him even in his darkest throes. The doctors were baffled. They could find no physical cause for his sudden mental collapse. Medications were adjusted, therapies tried, but nothing seemed to bring him back to the reality they all shared. It was as if he was trapped in a world of his own making, a labyrinth of the mind from which he could find no exit. As the weeks turned into months, there were brief, tantalizing moments when clarity would return. During these lucid intervals, he recognized his wife and spoke with her of his fears and his confusion. ""I"	1913	1964.5128
"""No. I was just about to dress. You see, I'Ve been posing on the rug in front of the mirror all day. Geoff dear, do you know it was like doing something I had always done? As if I knew how perfectly but was just a little out of practice? I wonder if I couldn't have been a sculptor in some earlier life? ... Go away now, Geoff."""	"Geoff lingered at the doorway, his eyes lingering on her form with a mixture of admiration and curiosity. ""You do have an artist's soul, my dear.

If music was necessary, is that unworthy of music ? For this production Garrick composed a Prologue, one of his weakest, in which he asked pardon for daring to put an English opera on the stage: An Opera too ! played by an English Band ! Wrote in a Language which you understand ! I dare not say who wrote it — I could tell ye, To soften matters, Signor Shakespearelli.	But no, it's true, 'tis native, through and through, From British pen, its scenes and songs are drew. In trembling hope we lay this humble plan, To blend the notes that charm the heart of man. Yet, fear not, sirs, though sung in mother tongue, No rough-hewn lyrics shall offend the lung. The strains are polished, fit for fairest ear, And aim to bring each tender passion near. For what is music if not heart's own speech, A language where all souls in union reach? It lifts, it soars, it dives in human breast, And in its flight, both love and grief are dressed. So let us then this English opera try, And watch it with an unprejudiced eye. May harmony its steadfast course maintain, And Shakespearelli’s ghost not haunt in vain.

Within the city of Sheffield the excitement now rose to fever heat. It was known that the enemy had closed in upon the defences, and were now across the river, ready at any moment to continue their advance, which, as a matter of fact, had developed steadily without intermission, notwithstanding the heroic efforts of the defenders. In these days of smokeless powder it was hard for the Germans to see where the British lines of defence  were actually located, but the heavy pounding of the artillery duel, which had been going on since early morning, was now beginning to weaken as the German infantry, company by company, regiment by regiment, and brigade by brigade, were calmly launched to the attack. They were themselves masking the fire of the cannon of their own comrades as, by desperate rushes, they gradually ascended the slopes before them. The objective of the Vllth Corps seemed to be the strongpoint which has already been referred to as dominating the position a little west of Catcliffe, and the VHIth Corps were clearly directing their energies on the salient angle of the defence which was to be found a little south of Woodhouse.	The British, aware of the strategic importance of these locations, had fortified them heavily, laying down extensive wire entanglements and establishing numerous machine gun nests that commanded the approaches. The air was thick with tension, as the defenders prepared for what they knew would be a crucial confrontation. Observers stationed in the higher parts of the city relayed information back to the command post, where officers pored over maps and dispatched runners with orders. As the German forces moved up the slopes, the British artillery, positioned on the higher ground behind the front lines, adjusted their range. Shells began to fall with greater accuracy, causing chaos among the advancing enemy troops. However, the Germans were well-trained and kept pushing forward, their lines occasionally breaking but quickly reforming. The skies, too, were not silent, as occasional reconnaissance planes buzzed overhead, each side attempting to gain better intelligence on the other’s movements. The British anti-aircraft guns, though few in number, barked angrily whenever an enemy plane ventured too close. Back in Sheffield, civilians huddled in shelters, listening to the distant sounds	1906	1967.562
This analysis is really the pressing need of the present day, for it is the condition of the detailed and positive proposals which alone can give an answer to the quite positive and pertinent criticisms of a Richter or a Hirsch. counter attack is useless; it is much too easy, and the work has been well enough done already. What is required is the definition, stage by stage, of the processes and methods leading up to and belonging to the proposed re organisation of industry and society. We have had enough of the vague and general ideals; they may be the logical goal, — but logic is the last thing we want. We want the practical compromise which defies logic. Most certainly we do not want any more loose talk about equality of opportunity or of anything else. Equality is quite the wickedest word in the political vocabulary.	It evokes illusions and disappointments, leading often to strife rather than the unity it promises. What we require is a clear understanding of the roles of different social strata and how they can contribute uniquely to the common good without the pretense of homogeneity. This calls for a reevaluation of values and a reorganization of societal roles that acknowledges differences, harnesses individual strengths and addresses specific needs.  The path forward must engage with the real conditions of diverse populations, considering the varied economic, geographic, and cultural contexts that influence their interactions with industry and society. It demands a meticulous planning of educational, economic, and social policies that are tailored to lift up all members of society in a manner that respects their initial standing. This requires a granular approach to policy-making, one that moves beyond grandiose proclamations and into the minutiae of administrative execution. Moreover, such reorganization must be dynamic, allowing for the continuous adjustment and feedback that real-time data and evolving circumstances necessitate. It is only through such detailed, thoughtful, and adaptable planning that we can hope to craft a	1908	2007.4723
"Amongst the colleagues of Garrick who visited Paris and were received by Monnet we note Grimaldi the dancer, father of the celebrated clown ; Angelo, the riding and fencing master4; King, the comedian; Mrs. Abington, the well-known actress, whom Garrick has described as "" the worst of all bad women, "" but whom Monnet considered charming, ""full of wit, acquirements, and politeness."" In short, Monnet was a perfect bureau of exchange between France and England and a 1 Torre was a curious character and a mystic. There are in the Forster Collection letters of his to Garrick in which he offers to reveal the secret of the Cabala and to give instructions "" for harvesting the Celestial Manna.""

Monnet's influence and connections indeed made him a central figure in the cultural exchange that flourished between France and England during the eighteenth century. His keen eye for talent and his broad appreciation for the arts across national boundaries enriched the cultural scenes of both countries, allowing for a mutual exchange that would shape the artistic landscape of the era. In his salons, one could encounter a diverse array of artists from various disciplines, each contributing their unique perspectives and skills. These gatherings not only fostered artistic collaborations but also allowed for the cross-pollination of ideas and styles. Monnet’s ability to recognize and nurture talent was unparalleled, and his contributions to the arts were recognized by many. His role as a cultural ambassador was not limited to personal connections and introductions. He actively promoted the works of English playwrights in France and French playwrights in England, thereby broadening the audience and appreciation for each nation’s literary achievements. Through his efforts, plays that might have remained confined within national borders reached a wider, international audience, enhancing their impact and legacy. Furthermore, Monnet's personal charm and diplomatic	1912	2006.2932
"There is,  280 furthermore, no doubt that this particular adjective has been the subject of controversy for generations. Just as there are men, so there are words, which seem born to endure contumely. They are constantly subjected to the hardest sort of buffetings both from the wise and the unwise. One of these unfortunates is talented. Like reliable, it has always had a thorny road to travel. Macaulay tells us that he would not use it, first because it was not wanted, and secondly because it is never heard "" from those who speak very good English."" This latter statement, if correct, would be ample justification for not employing it. But the reason that Coleridge gave for his denunciation of it was in no sense a reason at all. Ho missed the only possible linguistic objection to it."	Coleridge's criticism was more of an aesthetic judgment than a linguistic analysis. He claimed that 'talented' was a barbarous coinage, much like 'gifted'—too passive to describe the active nature of possessing skill or artistry. Yet, the real issue that linguists might contend with is the suffix '-ed' making it seem as though 'talent' is a condition one suffers from rather than possesses actively. This construction is akin to 'moneyed' or 'leisured', where the suffix implies a state of being rather than an active, dynamic quality. Furthermore, it's worth noting that language evolves and adapts to the needs of its speakers. The word 'talented', despite its supposed lack of pedigree, fills a linguistic niche. It succinctly describes possessing notable ability in a way that is more convenient than the more cumbersome alternatives like 'having talent' or 'skilled'. Over time, usage dictates acceptability, and 'talented', having been widely adopted, now enjoys a place in standard English, regardless of earlier criticisms. Thus, while the	1913	1997.4552
Each piece was loaded up to 27 tonnes at /, curve A, and then relieved from stress; the first was then immediately reloaded steadily up to the point of fracture, developing a yield point at q just below 28 tonnes: its subsequent strains are shown by the full line, curve B. The second piece was allowed to rest 24 hours before 3S 30 25 20 r S 10 r 3 — B V7 y / f 7/ J 0 ofr 6J/C 0 001 002 0 03 004- Extensions in, inches Fig. 37. reloading, the yield not occurring until the point s, about 30 tonnes load, and the subsequent extensions being as shown on the dotted curve C. The ultimate extension was greater in the specimen which was not allowed a long interval in which to harden after the original overstrain, and the fractures corresponded to those for metals of different ductility (see Art. 37). The raising of the yield point is even more marked after an interval in the loading if the load is allowed to remain on instead of being removed and even a short stoppage in the application of the load produces a notch on the stress strain diagram.	This phenomenon, known as strain aging, is due to the diffusion of interstitial atoms to the dislocations within the metal during the rest period, thereby pinning them and increasing the yield strength. This behavior can be crucial for understanding and predicting the mechanical properties of materials under cyclic loading conditions. The implications for structural engineering are significant, as the mechanical performance of materials under repeated loading can differ markedly from that under a single load application. Further tests conducted with varying rest periods and different materials have shown that the extent of strain aging and the consequent increase in yield strength can vary widely depending on the type of metal and its microstructural characteristics. For instance, steels with higher carbon content generally exhibit more pronounced strain aging effects due to the larger number of carbon atoms available for diffusion. Moreover, the temperature during the rest period can also affect the rate of strain aging. Higher temperatures generally accelerate diffusion, leading to more rapid aging and a quicker increase in yield strength. Conversely, at lower temperatures, the aging process is slowed, potentially requiring longer rest periods to achieve similar effects. These insights are valuable for the design	1908	1993.4523

However, the second method provides a more detailed analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of how different components of the petroleum react under specific conditions. This is crucial for ensuring consistency in oil quality, especially when used in various lighting applications. To further refine the specifications, it would be beneficial to include tests for flash point and freezing point, as these properties significantly affect the safety and performance of the burning oil in different environments. The flash point test ensures that the petroleum does not vaporize too quickly, which can be a safety hazard, while the freezing point test ensures that the oil remains liquid at lower temperatures, maintaining its functionality in colder climates. Moreover, the presence of impurities such as sulfur and metals should also be quantified, as these can influence the burning efficiency and emission characteristics of the petroleum. By setting limits on these impurities, one can ensure a cleaner burn, reducing the environmental impact and improving air quality where the oil is used. In conclusion, by adopting a comprehensive specification that includes both chemical composition and physical properties, along with impurity content, one can effectively standardize the quality of illumin	1912	2005.8859
Efforts are being made to supply the missing information. From experiments on a particular aeroplane model, the results of which are given in other reports, the following values of the resistance derivatives and other necessary data for stability calculations have been extracted. The data may be taken as indicating the order of magnitude of the several quantities for all machines. A discussion of their origin and extent of variation has been given which will indicate the nature of the changes to be expected. The full scale machine corresponding to the model has been assumed to have a wing area of rather less than 300 sq. ft., a weight of 1,300 lbs., and a flying speed of 80 ft./sec. (55 mph.). The mass is taken as ^?	approximately 40 slug (a slug being a unit of mass in the British system where the force of gravity acting on a mass of one slug accelerates it at 32 feet per second squared). The values for the resistance derivatives, such as the drag coefficient and lift coefficient, have been calculated based on the wing geometry and airfoil characteristics used in the model. The drag coefficient, typically denoted as \( C_d \), is found to be around 0.02 at cruising speed, which is a typical value for streamlined bodies. The lift coefficient, \( C_l \), at the angle of attack used during level flight is approximately 0.5. These coefficients are critical for determining the aerodynamic forces acting on the aircraft and hence its stability and control characteristics. Further stability derivatives like the pitching moment coefficient (\( C_m \)) and the side force coefficient (\( C_y \)) have also been documented. The pitching moment coefficient is crucial for understanding the longitudinal stability of the aircraft, particularly in response to disturbances that pitch the nose up or down. Typical values observed range from -0.	1912	1990.2587
"Youth's crossroads BY AVERY ABBOTT AS to a magnet the youth came, blundering with elaborate casual "" ness, between the shoulders and elbows of intervening shoppers. His regard was as direct as that of the girl was subtle. In the gaudy chaos of the Ten Cent Store basement Marie Myers stood all day long beside a glassily veneered piano, where she demonstrated vocally a complete line of the latest songs and catches. Her eyes, long lidded, soft, and dark, might have betrayed intelligence, sympathy, even a certain fineness, if her parted black hair had not been combed down so close above them, and puffed at each side so hugely as quite to overshadow any natural expression. She was now rendering, for the sixth time since 9 a.m.., that saccharine soprano solo, "" If Lovey Should Die, What Would Ducky Do?"" In the midst of the chorus she raised her black eyebrows, uncovered her white teeth in a carmine tinted smile, swayed her head this way and that, and altogether came as near as she was able to reaching the o n 1 y standard she knew — that of the vaudeville beauty. Just what occasioned this transformation it would be hard for the surface observer to decide."	Perhaps it was the presence of the youth, who, despite his attempts at nonchalance, had a gleam of unmistakable interest in his eyes. Or, perhaps it was the sheer repetition of the song, which by now allowed her muscles to follow the routine while her mind wandered. Whatever the reason, Marie found herself more animated, her voice inflecting with a vibrancy usually reserved for the final performance of the day when her energy peaked with the anticipation of solitude and rest. The youth, on his part, seemed captivated, not just by the performance, but by the performer herself. He lingered near the piano, feigning interest in the stacks of colorful sheet music and occasionally glancing at the small array of musical instruments arranged haphazardly on a nearby table. His fingers, however, betrayed his true intent, tapping in sync with the melody, not touching anything that might necessitate a purchase or a departure. As the song ended and the sparse applause from a few distracted shoppers faded, Marie caught his eye. She offered a cautious smile—one that seemed to ask	1913	1975.5234
"The point of my whole argument is this: If there were such a thing as British Public Opinion in a national sense, would it condemn the new movements in Art? If the British masses could see your pictures, for instance, those of Estelle Rice, or the best works of the Italian Futurists, do you imagine they would prove as indifferent to Art as they would seem to have become to pictures of saints, angels, ancient history heroes, and modern grandees who can afford to have their portraits painted ? Hitherto, every charge of lack of artistic appreciation that may have been brought by the  330 March 14, 1912 THE^FREEWOMAIN Modernist Painters against the British Public has included me among the "" guilty "" masses."	Yet, if truly exposed to the radical shifts and vibrant expressions of the new artistic movements, would not the public, even the so-called uninitiated masses, find a resonance with the raw, unfiltered emotions and innovative forms these works present? It is often said that true art has the power to transcend boundaries and speak directly to the soul. Thus, it is conceivable that, given the opportunity, the British public might not only understand but also embrace these avant-garde expressions as a refreshing departure from the traditional and mundane. Consider the visceral impact of Futurism, with its celebration of modernity, speed, and technological progress, or the emotional depth of Expressionism, which seeks to convey the most subjective of experiences directly onto the canvas. These movements offer a new language of art that could potentially captivate and engage a wider audience than the elites and connoisseurs who currently champion them.  The problem, therefore, may not lie in a supposed innate indifference towards art among the British masses, but rather in a lack of exposure and accessibility to these pioneering works. The conventional galleries and exhibitions	1911	2000.276
All Europe was then of the same stuff; a vague, hardly conscious instinct of unity survived in Britain as it survived in Gaul. But the social fact on which men were most clear and to which their affections, their fears and their daily habits were attached was the dependence of a number of free men each upon his lord, and the whole host formed by the gathering of such lords, supported by the agricultural labour of the great mass of the people who never entered the field and who were not yet in law technically free, though centuries of Christian influence had long ago destroyed the servile basis of that old Roman   civilisation whence the eleventh century society of England and of France had both proceeded. On this account we must never look at the struggle between William the Invader and the opponents whom he met upon English soil as a national struggle.	It was rather a contest of personal power and feudal allegiances, where the fabric of society was woven through layers of loyalty to overlords and the intricate web of feudal duties. The Norman Conquest, therefore, should not be seen merely as a foreign domination but as a reorganization of the existing social and political structures, where the new Norman lords inserted themselves at the top of the hierarchy, often adopting the titles and lands of the existing English aristocracy. This feudal system, deeply rooted in both Norman and English traditions, emphasized a hierarchical network where land was exchanged for military service. The common people, while distant from the machinations of their rulers, were nonetheless integral to the sustenance of this system, providing the agricultural labor that supported the feudal lords and their retinues. Their lives, bound to the soil, were largely unaffected in the immediate sense by the changes in lordship, though the long-term cultural and administrative reforms brought by the Normans would eventually transform the landscape of English governance and social structure. In understanding this era, it is crucial to recognize the continuity and transformation in governance.	1912	1937.8596
(ii) Plates 5-11; Figs. 13-33. — Two series of cinematograph pictures are given showing the growth of eddies behind a circular cylinder and an aerofoil respectively. The aerofoil was a modification of the aerofoil B.A.F. 6r 11 inches along the chord. The cylinder was A inch in diameter. The photographs were taken by using a solution of condensed milk made up to approximately unit density by the addition of a few drops of alcohol. In the case of the aerofoil some drops of the oil mixture described above were also introduced.	The camera was set to capture a frame every 0.2 seconds, ensuring detailed visualization of the flow patterns as they evolved. The light source was positioned to optimize contrast, casting shadows that clearly delineated the eddies and vortices forming in the wake of the objects. For the circular cylinder, the sequence of images vividly demonstrated the formation of the von Kármán vortex street. Initially, small disturbances appeared in the laminar flow immediately behind the cylinder. These disturbances grew into well-defined vortices that alternately shed from each side of the cylinder, creating a staggered pattern downstream. The flow visualization highlighted the periodic nature of the vortex shedding and allowed for the calculation of the Strouhal number based on the frequency of vortex shedding and the speed of the flow. In contrast, the aerofoil series displayed a more complex interaction of flow structures. Initially, a smooth laminar flow adhered to the surface of the aerofoil, but as the flow continued past the maximum thickness point, it began to separate, forming a turbulent wake.

This results in a decreasing lift-to-drift ratio, indicating less aerodynamic efficiency at steeper angles. The CP.

If, now, it has been shown that no necessary correlation exists between particular logical concepts and the formal method of their grammatical rendering, and if, furthermore, there can not even be shown to be a hard and fast line in grammatical treatment between concepts of a derivational and concepts of a more definitely relational character, what becomes of the logical category per southeast as a criterion of linguistic classification on the basis of form? Evidently it fails us. Of however great psychological interest it might be to map out the distribution in various linguistic stocks of logical concepts receiving formal treatment, it is clear that no satisfactory formal classification of linguistic types would result from such a mapping.	Indeed, the variability and fluidity within languages themselves, as they adapt and evolve over time, further complicate any attempts at rigid classification based on form alone. Language, in its essence, is a dynamic and living entity, constantly influenced by cultural shifts, technological advancements, and the intermingling of different linguistic communities. The notion that languages can be neatly categorized into fixed types based on the formal treatment of logical concepts is thus overly simplistic and does not account for the nuanced realities of linguistic practice. Moreover, this approach overlooks the functional aspects of language that often dictate form. For instance, the pragmatic needs of a speaker, such as the desire to emphasize a particular aspect of a message or to adapt speech to fit social context, play a significant role in shaping grammatical structures. These functional needs can lead to significant variations in how logical concepts are expressed, even within a single language or dialect. Therefore, while the study of how languages formally encode logical concepts is undoubtedly valuable, it should not be seen as a definitive method for classifying languages. Instead, a more holistic approach, one that considers both	1911	2006.2505
An expert’s ﬁrst duty is to thoroughly acquaint himself with the whole story; he must learn all the facts and circumstances, visit the scene of controversy before he can attempt a conclusion. He should deny hasty answers and opinions, but reserve his decisions upon all important  questions, and in the sober atmosphere of his study or office, secure from excitement and the colouring of partisan spirit, with his books for counsel and his computations for guides, determine questions upon which he muv be asked to stake his reputation and professional experience and 0Ol1tTOVl‘ht the opinions of brother engineers.	This methodical approach not only ensures accuracy but also engenders a sense of trust and reliability in his judgments. An expert must be cautious, for his words carry weight and can have far-reaching effects on the outcomes of legal battles, the implementation of engineering projects, and the safety of the public. He must remember that his allegiance is to the truth and the principles of his profession, not to the persuasions of those who may seek to influence his opinions for their own ends. The expert should also keep abreast of the latest developments in his field. Continuous learning and adaptation are essential, as technology and methodologies evolve. He should attend conferences, participate in professional forums, and read scholarly articles to refine his expertise and understanding. This ongoing education not only enhances his credibility but also fortifies his capacity to provide the most current and comprehensive analyses. Furthermore, an expert should document his findings meticulously. Detailed records and transparent methodologies support the credibility of his conclusions and provide a clear trail for verification or future reference. This documentation is crucial, especially in cases where the expert's findings might be challenged or subjected to peer review	1913	1965.9869

It is evident that the application of Emaillite No. 2 and No. 3 has an impact on the durability and resistance of the linen fabric when subjected to weathering conditions. The treated samples (No. 90) displayed increased tensile strength compared to the untreated RAF. 55 (No. 89), suggesting that the Emaillite coatings effectively enhance the fabric's structural integrity against environmental stress. Further analysis of the samples used on the Army aeroplane BE. 2 (No. 91) after 7 months of actual service conditions revealed a slight decrease in tensile strength compared to the newly treated samples (No. 90), yet they still maintained higher strength than the original untreated fabric. This indicates that while there is some degradation over time under operational conditions, the protective treatments substantially mitigate this effect. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate fabric treatments for military applications, particularly in aviation where material performance can significantly influence the overall efficacy and safety of	1912	2001.844

It is suggested that Eiffel's experiments, and those of the author {see Abstract 123), afford an experimental verification of the above conclusions. The action of the thrust P will tend to augment the pitch, while that of the centrifugal force F will tend to diminish the pitch. In general, there will be increase or diminution of pitch according as an expression of the form Pb — Fa is positive or negative, a, b being linear quantities. P and F are proportional to «'! )', hence this expression is of the form nW\kxb — hia).	The stability of the system, therefore, depends on the relative values of kxb and hia. If kxb exceeds hia, the system will experience an increase in pitch, leading to a potentially unstable configuration unless controlled. Conversely, if hia exceeds kxb, the pitch will decrease, potentially stabilizing the system under certain conditions. This interaction between pitch augmentation and reduction is critical in the design of aerodynamic structures and devices, such as propellers and turbines. By adjusting the parameters k, h, a, and b, engineers can manipulate the behavior of these systems under various operational conditions. The precise balance and tuning of these factors are essential for achieving desired performance characteristics while maintaining structural stability and safety. Further research and experimental analysis are required to refine these theoretical predictions and to optimize the design parameters for specific applications. The integration of computational fluid dynamics simulations with experimental data from structures like those studied by Eiffel can provide deeper insights into the complex dynamics governing these aerodynamic systems.	1912	2003.2258
"Yet the dame who sold stockings where he was painting thought that the gentleman who once occupied the chateau on the top of the hill in autre fois made it his custom to pass under this fine arch. This was plausible, as he could not have reached the lower road without doing so. All that is left of his stronghold now is a grim bit of architecture which the brisk, nimble, sprightly, cheerful occupants of Allegre call the Gallows. One could not say that the town lived in its past, but to judge by the maddening hordes of children, her future was promising. They had a brisk, nimble, sprightly, cheerful way of blocking the line of vision of my three artists, and a slow, shambling, limping, cheerless way when being pushed out of it. Yet those who sat upon the pencil of the Illustrator or draped themselves over the palette of the Young Lady betrayed a diablerie refreshing in its novelty. ""Aha, the roof of my father!"" one would exclaim, as the Illustrator sketched in a building. The roof was unsuccessful, and the eraser descended upon it."	The Young Lady, meanwhile, found herself a favorite subject among the inquisitive gazes of the town's youth, her easel continually besieged by small faces peeking around its edges. “Mademoiselle, what colors are you using?” one small voice would chirp, as tiny fingers pointed at the palette smeared with hues of the sunset. “And why is the sky pink and not blue?” another would inquire with a furrowed brow, the simplicity of the question belying the depth of artistic interpretation it demanded. The Old Master, less disturbed by the children but not immune to their charm, chuckled softly from behind his canvas. He painted with a meticulous hand, capturing the crumbling arches and the ivy-clad remnants of the old chateau. His brush strokes preserved the melancholy of the ruins, a stark contrast to the lively scene around him. As the afternoon waned, the shadows lengthened, and the air cooled, the children’s mothers called them home, their voices carrying across the square. The artists packed their tools, the day’s work	1913	1926.0323
"There are men in every board of trade, for instance, who are partners — intimate and constant partners — with political machines which the parties they are connected with are pretending to fight. ""The business of politics at this moment is to reconstruct our government by putting it upon its right basis again, which is the basis of popular will and not the basis of private arrangement. The partnership is about to be dissolved by public process; the partnership is about to be made impossible by pitiless publicity. ""I have found audiences made up of the common people of this country quicker to take a point, quicker to understand an argument, quicker to comprehend a principle than many a college class that I have led; not because the college class lacked intelligence, but because a class of college men is not in contact with actual life, day by day, and a body of the common citizenship of the United States is in contact with actual life, day by day."	It is this close contact with the real movements of the world, with the direct and pressing problems of the community, that sharpens the average man’s instincts and quickens his perceptions. The common citizen, dealing with the common vicissitudes and needs of life, acquires a sort of practical wisdom and a keen sense of reality that no academic training can quite confer. This is why the judgment of the people, when unclouded by misinformation or manipulation, often arrives at conclusions that are sound and measures that are just. Therefore, it is essential that the channels of information remain open and uncorrupted, that discussions be grounded in facts and guided by honesty. It is necessary that the people be allowed the full light of truth, for only then can they exercise their natural wisdom in the governance of their affairs. The role of a true leader in a democracy is not to manipulate public opinion to serve private ends, but to inform, educate, and inspire the public towards making decisions that are in their own best interests and in the interests of the nation as a whole. Thus, the task before us	1911	1947.1525
"A notable development has been made in the direction of direct and indirect lighting, and the latter, in particular, has made considerable progress. The development of artistic glassware is making considerable strides, and there have also been improvements in metallic reflectors. In street lighting there has been a great development of the so called "" great white way "" method of lighting, frequently carried out as the result of private enterprise of Boards of Trade or groups of merchants. Supervision is necessary to keep this method within due bounds, and to insure that the illumination is diffused on scientific and artistic lines. High pressure Gas Lighting in England. The remarkable development of high pressure gas in Europe has naturally attracted attention in the States, and at the Convention papers were presented by MR. F. W. GOODENOUGH (of the Gas Light & Coke Co., London, and Chairman of the Council of the British Illuminating Engineering Society), HERB 0."	ELLIS (of the Gas Light & Electric Company, Berlin), and others, detailing the advancements and benefits of this technology. High pressure gas lighting, which operates at pressures significantly higher than traditional systems, allows for brighter and more efficient lighting. This has led to its increased adoption in public spaces, notably streets and large buildings where strong, consistent lighting is essential. The discussions highlighted the improvements in public safety and aesthetic appeal that this form of lighting can bring to urban environments. Furthermore, the efficiency of high pressure systems translates into lower operational costs over time, despite the higher initial investment. This aspect is particularly appealing to municipal governments and companies looking to reduce their environmental impact and operational expenses. The convention also touched upon the integration of these lighting systems with modern control technologies, allowing for smarter energy management and adaptive lighting solutions. This adaptability not only enhances the functionality of urban spaces but also contributes to the creation of dynamic atmospheres that can change depending on the time of day or the specific needs of an event. Overall, the consensus at the convention was that high pressure gas lighting, when implemented thoughtfully and regulated	1912	2005.1313
"He must have a special licence for even slight interior modifications. He must secure a licence in accordance with the kind of business he does, and pay a special extra tax in connexion therewith for the ambulance service, for registration of scales, and for a special permit to use same. He pays also a tax for sanitary measures. The small provision merchant or shopkeeper with a capital of, say, $2,500, stocking all kinds of provisions and liquors for retail trade, as is the custom here, pays not far from $200 per year in licences and special taxes. Booker T. Washington's Belief ""The work I am doing can at best but reach the few. It leaves the mass of my people untouched. It helps the individual coloured man, and through him there is a dispersion of the benefits of industrial education. But the disease that retards the growth of the black man is social rather than individual, and it can be cured only by the application of a remedy that will teach society as a whole."	"The remedy lies in education—not merely in the education that consists of the mastery of books, but in that broader education obtained through the mastery of self, the understanding of social institutions, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. This broader education should include industrial training, the development of the hand as well as the mind, and the ability to perform skilled labor which the world values and for which it pays. This kind of education will not only uplift the individual but will elevate the race by making it a more valuable component of society, capable of contributing to the common good."" Washington believed that such an approach would foster a sense of dignity and self-worth among African Americans, which in turn would lead to greater social and economic opportunities. By promoting self-sufficiency and demonstrating the economic and social contributions of African Americans, barriers would gradually erode, leading to a more inclusive and equitable society. It was his conviction that true progress for his people would come through hard work, self-help, and practical education, which would prepare them not just to participate in society, but to transform it."	1911	1941.5863
THE RECENT REPORT OF THE GLASGOW MUNICIPAL RAILWAYS THE recently published report of the municipally owned and operated street railways of Glasgow, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1911, affords another striking illustration of the value and importance of public ownership of public utilities. When the city took over her street railways, the valuation for tax purposes levied in 1894 and 1895 for the entire system amounted to £18,000, or about $00,000. Under municipal ownership the systern has been so extended, improved and developed that the valuation for tax purposes for 1910 and 1911 was £258,838, or about $[,294,190. The tax levied on the entire street railway system when the city took it over amounted to £2,485, or about $12,425. 456 The tax levy for 1910 and 1911 was £16,025, or about $305,125. During the past year the total income from the railway system, estimating five dollars to the pound, amounted to $4,747,440.	Furthermore, the operational expenses, including maintenance and staff salaries, were efficiently managed, resulting in expenditures amounting to $3,251,520. This left a substantial net income of $1,495,920, which could be reinvested into further improvements of the system or other municipal projects, illustrating the financial sustainability of public ownership. The report also highlighted an increase in ridership, a testament to the system's reliability and efficiency under city management. The number of passengers carried during the year rose by 15%, a clear indicator of public approval and increased dependency on the municipal service. Additionally, the report detailed the advancements in infrastructure and technology. New tracks had been laid in areas previously underserved, and older tracks were upgraded to modern standards, enhancing the overall quality of service. The introduction of electric trams replaced the older, less efficient models, reducing operational costs and environmental impact. The success of Glasgow's municipal railways not only underscores the potential for public control of utilities to meet and adapt to the needs of the community but also serves as an influential model for other cities considering similar approaches.

Similarly, in the petroleum solution, which contains the neutral fats and any cholesterol or other unsaponifiable substances that may be present, these latter are obtained by saponifying the fat with alcoholic potash, dissolving the product in equal parts of alcohol and water, and shaking the solution with petroleum aether. The saponified fats will be contained in the alcoholic solution and the unsaponifiable matter in the petroleum aether. If, however, the original fat contains phospholipines a solution of it in petroleum is likely to give up to 50 percent alcohol some of these phospholipines as well as any soap that is present in the mixture. The subject matter, therefore, of this section resolves itself primarily into three divisions — the separation, identification and estimation of — 1. The various fatty acids (pp. 75-85); and 2. The various alcohols, that enter into the composition of the fat; 3. The phospholipines, so far as the present state of our knowledge of these substances permits (pp. 90-105). I.	The Separation of Fatty Acids To separate the fatty acids from the fat mixture, the solution is first saponified, typically using a known quantity of alcoholic potassium hydroxide. This process breaks down the ester bonds in the triglycerides, releasing the fatty acids and glycerol. After saponification, the mixture is acidified with a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, which liberates the free fatty acids from their potassium salts. The liberated fatty acids, being insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents, are then extracted with an appropriate solvent such as ether or hexane. II. Identification of Fatty Acids and Alcohols Once the fatty acids have been separated, they can be identified by various analytical techniques. Gas chromatography (GC) is commonly used for this purpose, as it allows for the separation and identification based on the volatility and molecular weight of the compounds. Mass spectrometry (MS) can also be coupled with GC to provide further structural information about the fatty acids and alcohols present. Additionally, infrared	1913	1989.1649
"He has none of that ecstatic contemplation of the land, that hunger for the soul of the countryside, that made Borrow cast himself down and weep for emotion beside the Tweed, and W. H. Hudson love the Wiltshire Downs as a man loves a woman. That passionate love of the country is rare among us now. For although the term "" speculative builder "" is justly used as an expression of contempt for a being that is ravaging the England of today, as the Questing Beast laid waste King Arthur's realms, no speculative builder has ever been lynched or even maimed in the public streets. We shall believe in the sincerity of the Garden City movement when the inhabitants of Hampstead Garden Suburb lead an armed attack on the malignant builders who are tearing up the beauties of Mill Hill and Edgware. Nor did Mr. Davies really go on tramp, because he drew a lesson from the rapid transition of the 'bus horse from lusty youth to cats' meat; nor because he decided not to die young as a wage slave, but to live long as a beggar."	Rather, his journey was one of personal exploration and escape, a quest for freedom from the shackles of conventional employment and the monotony of urban life. He sought the open road not merely as a refuge but as a classroom, where each hedgerow, each village inn, and each passerby was a teacher of sorts. In his wanderings, he was not driven by the same profound and almost mystical connection to the landscape that guided the steps of those like Borrow and Hudson. His was a more pragmatic escape, driven by a desire for liberty and the simple pleasures of life on the road. Davies' tramping was about the joy of movement, the discovery of self in the face of hardship, and an appreciation for the varied tapestry of human existence encountered along the way. His connection to the countryside was appreciative and respectful, but lacked the deep, almost spiritual bond that others felt—a bond that made them view the rolling hills and quiet woods as entities to be adored and revered, not just admired. For Davies, the road was a means to an end, an avenue	1911	1980.3925

She was highly favoured by nature; her face was beautiful, her figure dignified, and her voice rich and moving. She excelled in the r61es of princesses, and expressed wounded love and suffering with much pathos; but she was lacking in force.	Her presence on stage was like a soft melody, gentle and soothing, yet it failed to stir the depths of the soul as might a more tempestuous performance. Critics often commented on her ethereal quality, which, while enchanting, left audiences more contemplative than impassioned. It was as though her performances, impeccably crafted and deeply felt, floated just above the reach of raw human emotion, touching upon it but never fully plunging in. Mile Gaussin's artistry was evident in her meticulous attention to detail—the subtle inflections of her voice, the deliberate movements that seemed almost choreographed in their precision. She understood the characters she portrayed, conveyed their stories with clarity and elegance, but seldom did she allow herself to merge completely with their turmoil and passion. This restraint, while it earned her praise for its grace and beauty, also drew mild reproach for the lack of fervor needed to truly embody the tragic heroines of the stage. Despite this, her performances were celebrated, her ability to evoke the atmosphere of a scene was unmatched, and her interpretation of noble characters carried	1912	1971.6007

An example from the deceleration table (11) will point out its variation from the acceleration table. Under the heading d=l/16v, displacements for a deceleration equal to 1/16 of the initial velocity are tabulated. In 3 hours the centre will move .96 units instead of the full unit assigned to the constant velocity wind system; in 6 hours it will travel 1.88 units; in 15 hours it will travel 4.22 units; and in 36 hours it will travel only 7.52 units.	This significant reduction in distance traveled is indicative of the profound impact deceleration has on the cyclonic system's movement over time. Comparatively, if the velocity remained constant without any deceleration, the system would continue to travel 1 unit per 3 hours consistently, resulting in a travel of 12 units over 36 hours. Therefore, the effect of deceleration is to slow down the progression of the system dramatically, as evidenced by the system traveling nearly 4.5 units less over the same time period when deceleration is factored in. Continuing with the analysis, the deceleration further intensifies as time progresses. For instance, between 27 to 30 hours, the distance traveled is merely 0.87 units, and from 33 to 36 hours, it reduces to just 0.75 units, highlighting an increasing rate of deceleration. This pattern suggests that as the cyclonic system loses momentum, its ability to move forward decreases substantially, which could be due to various atmospheric interactions such as friction with the Earth's surface, changes in	1913	1997.3187
Now, if experience is the name for the totality of observed facts our positive knowledge will be knowledge founded on and concerning experience. But when we speak of thus confining knowledge to experience we may mean one of two things. We may mean that we know nothing beyond the actual range of our observation, and this at first sight is what the strict use of the term would suggest. A moment's consideration, however, shows us that such a limitation, far from establishing science, would destroy it. It would indeed land us in an extreme form of scepticism. My experience, taken in this more rigid sense, is what I now see and feel together with what I have seen and felt.	But if I am to know nothing beyond this, how can I assert that the sun will rise tomorrow, or that water will boil under certain conditions? Clearly, my past experiences alone cannot justify such predictions unless I assume some uniformity in nature, which extends beyond my immediate sensory experiences. This assumption, that the course of nature continues uniformly, is what enables us to make inferences about future and unseen events based on past observations.  Thus, when we confine knowledge to experience, we must understand this in a broader sense. It is not merely the direct sensory experiences themselves that constitute our knowledge, but also the conclusions we draw from these experiences about the unseen and the future. These conclusions are justified by the principle of the uniformity of nature, which, though itself not observable, is a necessary presupposition of scientific thought.  Therefore, our knowledge of experience includes not only what has been directly observed, but also what can be inferred about the unobserved. In this way, the realm of experience expands from the immediately perceptible to include the structures and laws governing the observable phenomena, allowing	1908	1921.6216
Then this group also includes all measuring or careful drawing; it includes, with reference to the past, the training in careful remembering and reproduction of the outer impressions; with reference to the future, all training in exact expectation and determination. Hence, we must place here the training in mathematical calculation. Whether we observe, or record, or measure, or calculate, we are always active, in order to find out what exists, or what has existed, or what will exist, and what in itself is independent of our doing. On the other hand, we have those numberless activities which really change the outer world. The sewing and cooking and weaving find their place here, as well as the manual training work of the boy, up to complex technical work and industrial training. Certain aspects of physical and chemical and biological experiment  241   ing, drawing and modelling must be included in the same class.	In all these endeavors, the aim is not just to observe or understand, but to manipulate, create, and alter. The distinction lies not merely in the nature of the tasks but in the engagement with the material world, transforming it according to human needs and artistic or scientific visions. This sphere of activity directly influences and reshapes the environment, crafting tools, garments, edifices, and myriad other artifacts that define human culture and civilization. These practical arts, while often considered less intellectual than fields like pure mathematics or theoretical physics, require a synthesis of knowledge and skill that is deeply intellectual in its own right. They demand an understanding of materials and processes, as well as creativity and problem-solving abilities that are responsive to tactile as well as visual and conceptual inputs. The chemist mixing reagents in a flask, the engineer designing a bridge, the artist sculpting a statue—all are engaged in a dialogue with the materials and forces of nature, guided by both empirical knowledge and theoretical understanding. Furthermore, these activities are often collaborative and cumulative, building upon the skills, designs, and discoveries of others. They	1909	2001.8965
Briefly, the Short Ballot principle looks toward simplification of the functions of citizenship, to the point where the present extraneous aids, in the shape of party machines, will no longer be necessary. It recognises the existence of a limit to the number of. elections that can be held simultaneously without making politics a business for experts only, andit believes that democracy will be secured if its organs are built in view of that limit. Secondly, the Short Ballot principle implies a greater unification of the functions of government.	This unification aims to reduce the multiplicity of elected officials, thus enabling the voter to focus on fewer, more impactful decisions. By concentrating responsibility in the hands of fewer officials, it becomes easier for the electorate to assess performance and hold leaders accountable. This principle also encourages a more streamlined government structure, which can lead to more efficient administration and clearer lines of authority and responsibility. Furthermore, the Short Ballot principle advocates for the election of key decision-makers while suggesting that subordinate positions, which are often technical and require specific expertise, should be filled through appointment rather than election. This adjustment is based on the belief that specialized knowledge and skills are better evaluated through meritocratic systems rather than the popular vote, which may not always guarantee the selection of the most competent individuals. Overall, the Short Ballot principle is not merely a reform of electoral mechanics but a broader vision for enhancing democratic governance by making it more understandable, manageable, and accountable to the ordinary citizen.	1911	2003.8209

He could count every step of their return as though they were the beats of his own heart — across the soft ground of the field, the dusty road, the hard beaten path. The big, roughly dressed man stood there before him, looking up at him with a quiet smile. ""Were you wanting to see me, Doctor?"""

Mr. Thompson, leaning back slightly, his hands clasped behind his back, considered the doctor’s words with a thoughtful expression.

My garden provides many a herb that aids in soothing common complaints, but specifics would help narrow down the choices."" The doctor, appreciative of the knowledge Mr. Thompson possessed, proceeded to outline the symptoms prevalent among the villagers — intermittent fevers, headaches, and a general malaise that seemed resistant to the usual treatments.

"She gives some unique descriptions of the Inca Indians, their pagan feasts and their historic ruins, closely resembling those at Thebes, in the environment of La Pas and Lake Titicaca. The city of Panama and the Canal are thoroughly gone into, the author having motored fifty miles along the Canal and minutely inspected that gigantic undertaking. From Colon we are taken along Central America via Columbia and Venezuela, and so home by the beautiful West Indies. It is the first time this entire coast has been written of from a woman's point of view. STANLEY PAUL & CO., 31 Essex Street, London, W.C.  A Tour through Old Provence Painter of ""Morocco, "" ""West Indies, "" ""Portugal, "" etc. Profusely illustrated, cloth boards, 6s. net The very name of Provence excites vivid anticipations of the quaint and the picturesque, and no more delightful companion for a trip through its old world associations with pen and pencil could be found than the author of this book."	Renowned for its sun-drenched villages, fields of lavender, and ancient vineyards, Provence offers a landscape steeped in history and culture. The author, with a keen eye and a deep appreciation for the region's past, guides readers through bustling market towns, serene abbeys, and Roman ruins that whisper tales of a bygone era. Each chapter unfolds like a painted scene, capturing the essence of Provence from the rugged hills of the Alpilles to the azure waters of the Côte d'Azur. As we traverse through towns like Arles, Avignon, and Aix, the narrative delves into the artistic legacy of the region, exploring the haunts of Van Gogh and Cézanne, whose works were profoundly influenced by the luminous Provençal light. The author’s descriptions of local festivals, with their vibrant displays of folklore and tradition, transport the reader to the heart of Provençal culture, where the past is celebrated with fervor and joy. Accompanied by illustrations that capture the unique charm of the region, from	1912	1987.0758
"In this single respect he is like Charles Lamb's Scotchman: ""His understanding is always at its meridian — you never see the first dawn, the early streaks. He has no falterings of self suspicion. Surmises, misgivings, half intuitions, semi consciousness, partial illuminations, dim instincts, embryo conceptions, have no place in his brain or vocabulary. The twilight of dubiety never falls upon him."" Byron, we are told, woke up and found himself famous. Bernard Shaw pro  18 duced Widowers' Houses and immediately ""became notorious as a dramatist."" Since that initial leap to a somewhat shaky pedestal, he has been much in the public prints. And one may with safety say that few literary men of genius have had such unworthy treatment from the newspaper press. The journalistic funny men regard him as fair game. The pert paragraphers finish him off in four lines, between a joke on the new headgear and a gibe at the suffragettes."	Yet, if truth be told, Shaw’s provocations are as deliberate as they are ingenious. He throws down gauntlets with the air of a man who not only expects but relishes a skirmish. Perhaps no other writer has so artfully mastered the art of the epigram, nor wielded it with such cutting precision. His plays, brimming with intellectual fireworks, are not merely to entertain but to challenge the complacency of his audience. His characters burst forth in a cascade of wit and wisdom that often leaves the unprepared listener bewildered and searching for solid ground. This very brilliance, however, is what incites the ire and mockery of lesser critics. They cannot reach the heights of his thought, so they aim to drag him down to their level with trivial barbs. It is a testament to Shaw's fortitude that he remains largely indifferent to these attacks, focusing instead on his craft and the messages he wishes to convey. In this, Shaw is much like his own creation, Professor Higgins, forging ahead in his work with little care for the opinions of the world around him	1911	1904.9672
86. built in Beam with any Symmetrical Loading. — For a symmetrically loaded beam of constant cross section the fixing couples at the supports are evidently equal, and Fig. 67 shows that equal couples at the ends of a span cause a bending moment of the same amount throughout. Or, from (7), Art. 85, if MB MA, M' = MA = MB at every section. Hence, the resulting ordinates of the bending moment diagram (see Art. 85) will consist of the difference in ordinates of a rectangle (the trapezoid APQB, Fig.	85) having height MA or MB, minus the ordinates of the triangular areas (APD and BQC, Fig. 85) that represent the varying moments due to the applied loads. The area of the rectangle represents the constant moment throughout the beam due to the support reactions, while the triangular areas account for the decrease in moment from the supports to the center of the beam where it is zero if the beam is symmetrically loaded. The position of zero moment, often called the point of contraflexure, occurs at the center of the beam under symmetrical loading conditions. This point is crucial in understanding the behavior of the beam under load as it indicates where the bending moment changes sign, which in turn affects how the beam will deform under the applied loads. Furthermore, the analysis of shear forces also plays a critical role in understanding beam behavior. The shear force diagram will show peaks at the supports and diminish to zero at the center of the beam, aligning with the point of contraflexure in the bending moment diagram. This is because, at any section of the beam, the shear force	1908	1988.0148
We should aim at giving the most agreeable light for the particular circumstances. The necessity for getting daylight effects was not of such importance as had been made out. If it were very necessary to have an equivalent to daylight for colour matching in certain premises, then a small counter lamp, such as a small box type of Moore tube, giving a daylight spectrum, could be provided at various points, and thus leave the general lighting of the premises to be executed on the basis of the most practical, agreeable, and effective illumination.	This approach not only ensures that the specific tasks requiring precise color discernment are adequately catered to, but also maintains an overall ambiance that contributes positively to the work environment. It is widely acknowledged that the quality of light affects the mood and productivity of individuals. Thus, by integrating task-specific lighting solutions with general lighting design, one can create a space that is both functionally and psychologically beneficial. Moreover, the selection of lighting should take into account the nature of the space and the tasks performed therein. For instance, in an office setting where reading and writing predominate, a cooler white light might enhance concentration and reduce eye strain. Conversely, in a setting like a restaurant, warmer tones can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, conducive to relaxation and social interaction. Furthermore, with advancements in lighting technology, options such as LED lights offer versatility in terms of adjustable color temperatures and intensities. This adaptability not only makes it possible to tailor lighting to specific tasks but also to change the mood of a space according to the time of day or the nature of activities being conducted. In conclusion, while the replication	1912	2006.9025
As the hull of a ship is covered with barnacles, so have the subways gathered to themselves concretionary growths of metropolitan accessories. Like a vast barometer, the subways record every modulation and fluctuation of city life. In the come and go of graded labour the pick and shovel lead the monkey wrench; the saw and chisel rise earlier than pencil and pen; the Semitic tide that every day is sucked into the great clothing factories flows in huge waves that inundate the trains before eight o'clock, and ebbs in weariness at five minutes past six. These are the human gulf streams that nourish Manhattan. To this add those emergency services which are demanded for special occasions. A baseball match involves emptying the ball grounds of forty thousand Reople in forty minutes.	This is a feat of coordination and rapid transit that challenges the very limits of human engineering. The subway tunnels become arteries pulsing with the lifeblood of fans, their fervor as palpable as the heat generated by their packed bodies. On New Year's Eve, the subways undergo another transformation—becoming the chariots of celebration. Revelers, adorned in glitter and hope, flood the platforms. The trains run with a frequency and precision that seem to sync with the heartbeat of the city as it counts down to the new year. On ordinary days, the subways cater to the more mundane yet vital flows of city life. Schoolchildren with heavy backpacks, artists with unwieldy canvases, nurses in scrubs, and tourists with maps crisscross paths in the labyrinth beneath the bustling city. Each train car is a microcosm of the city’s diversity, a snapshot of its complex social fabric. Yet, beyond these observable currents, there are subtler shifts that the subways register. The fluctuating economy can be read in the changing advertisements that line the station walls	1913	2007.4396
— For a circular section the resilience is — f . r per unit volume and for a rectangular section it is — ft \. r per unit volume (see Art. 93) 118. Open Coiled Helical Spring. (j) Axial Load W. — With the notation of the previous article, let the coils make everywhere an angle a with planes perpendicular to the axis of the helix (see Fig.	117). Assuming the wire to be perfectly flexible and neglecting the effect of gravity, the axial load W can be considered as uniformly distributed along the helix. The total axial extension, δ, of the spring can be given by the formula: \[ \delta = \frac{64 W R^3 n}{G d^4} \] where \( R \) is the mean radius of the coil, \( n \) is the number of active coils, \( G \) is the modulus of rigidity of the material, and \( d \) is the diameter of the wire. The stress in the wire can be approximated by: \[ \sigma = \frac{32 W R}{\pi d^3} \] This stress is a combination of torsional and direct shear stresses, as the wire in a helical spring is twisted as well as bent. The angle \( \alpha \) affects the stiffness of the spring and its ability to carry load. As \( \alpha \) increases, the spring becomes softer, meaning it will extend more under the same load	1908	1948.4642
Figure 47 displays the main regions and levels associated with the Cumulus. With a temperature of 70F at the surface and 55F at its top, the region below the cloud contains abundant local chimneys of air feeding into the base of the Cumulus. The condensation level, identical with the base of the cloud, has a temperature of 55F. The main body of the Cumulus lies in a layer of air whose temperature is decreased from 55F  76 at the condensation level to 36F at its top. This layer favours the ascent of saturated parcels. A cumulus cloud's size depends on the depth of this cloud containing layer. Above the cloud is a layer of air warmer than the top of the layer containing the Cumulus. The temperature rises from 36F in, to 45F above, the cloud. Rising parcels are definitely stopped at this level, although their momentum may carry them a short distance RISING PARCELS RESISTED SATURATED 55 F - - 70F PARCELS FAVOURED ^ — CONDENSATION LEVEL RISING DRY PARCELS FAVOURED Figure 47. Principal regions and levels associated with a Cumulus.	The inversion layer above the Cumulus acts as a cap, inhibiting further vertical development of the cloud unless the energy of the rising air is sufficient to overcome this barrier. This capping layer is crucial in determining the ultimate size and potential for precipitation from the Cumulus cloud. If the inversion is strong and persists, it can lead to the dispersal of the cloud; conversely, if the rising air can break through the inversion, significant cloud growth and possibly severe weather events like thunderstorms may occur. The dynamics within the Cumulus are also influenced by the surrounding environmental conditions, such as the presence of wind shear. Wind shear can tilt the cloud, allowing the updraft and downdraft to become separated. This separation can enhance the cloud's longevity and intensity by preventing the downdraft from cutting off the cloud's updraft, thereby sustaining the cloud's growth. Moreover, the moisture content at different levels plays a pivotal role. Higher moisture levels below the condensation point facilitate the formation of larger droplets and enhance the efficiency of the cloud's warm rain process. Conversely, drier air	1913	1999.287
The great thinkers of all times have devoted to it their fullest energy. From, the days of the classical Greek  54   philosophers to our own day, in which a new philosophical life seems to begin again, this question as to the ultimate meaning of truth and beauty and morality and religion, that is, as to the ultimate meaning of eternal values, has stood in the foreground. Each age has to answer this question in its own spirit. Our time cannot be satisfied by the beautiful answer which Plato gave to such inquiries; our time wants to analyse the facts carefully, and simply to accept that which the facts themselves suggest. Let us consider the material of our experience just as we find it in our naive life. Let us try to forget for a moment all that we have learned in our school knowledge and all that we have organised and harmonised in such life experience.	Let us approach the world with the fresh eyes of a child, unbiased and open to the pure phenomena as they present themselves. This unprejudiced observation is the first step towards understanding the intrinsic character of our experiences. It is only through this direct encounter with reality, unmediated by preconceived notions and theoretical frameworks, that we can begin to discern the fundamental qualities that govern the world around us. As we delve into this exploration, we may discover that the categories of truth, beauty, morality, and religion are not merely abstract concepts to be contemplated intellectually, but living realities that are deeply intertwined with our everyday existence. They manifest themselves in the choices we make, the relationships we forge, and the aspirations we pursue. Each individual, in their own unique way, participates in the ongoing creation and recreation of these eternal values. Thus, our quest for understanding is not a detached academic exercise, but a deeply personal journey that challenges us to integrate these values into the fabric of our lives. By doing so, we contribute to the collective human endeavor to articulate and embody the ultimate meaning of existence.	1909	1993.7927
"He ate one ""witchetty"" (grub), and once or twice, when everything was quiet, he elevated his head and tail quietly, and made a slight chirping noise, which he repeated two or three times, running forward a few steps between each cry. I fancy that fear has a good deal to do with their dying so quickly in captivity, as they are very nervous little animals, and the slightest sound disturbs them and starts them burrowing. When held in the hand they scratch incessantly."" Miss (1. Sweet has investigated the structure of the eye. The organ has quite degenerated. There are no eyelids, no eyeballs or muscles for moving one, no lens or retina."	Instead, the eye is reduced to a simple patch of photosensitive cells, barely capable of distinguishing light from darkness. This adaptation is thought to be a response to their subterranean lifestyle, where vision holds little utility. The focus on other senses, such as touch and hearing, becomes far more critical in navigating and surviving their underground environments. The tactile and auditory senses in these creatures are highly developed, allowing them to detect vibrations and changes in the soil around them, which is essential for avoiding predators and locating food. Their sensitivity to disturbances is not just a mere inconvenience but a vital aspect of their survival strategy. The slightest vibration could signal the approach of a predator, causing them to retreat or freeze. This heightened state of alertness, while beneficial in the wild, proves detrimental in captivity where constant, unfamiliar stimuli can lead to stress and rapid decline in health. Thus, understanding and mimicking their natural habitat as closely as possible is crucial when attempting to maintain their wellbeing in a controlled environment.	1909	2007.496
Is it really the case that woman is obsessed by the physical factor of the reproductive function in a higher degree than man ? I do not believe it. Of course, as a man, I cannot speak authoritatively concerning the private conversation of women. Many women do, I think, enjoy risky and even smutty stories, but so, of course, do the vast majority of men. If there be any difference, I should guess that men, as a rule, prefer the coarse Rabelaisian, and women the suggestive form of sexual humour. But there are, no doubt, exceptions. And there are men as well as women to whom obscenity of any kind is intolerably offensive.	Indeed, it is perhaps more accurate to say that the tolerance for or enjoyment of sexual humor varies more from individual to individual than it does between the sexes as a whole. Factors such as cultural background, personal values, and exposure to different social environments play significant roles in shaping one's response to such material. It is also noteworthy that the expression of sexuality in humor and conversation often mirrors the societal norms and taboos of the time. Men and women alike can be both the purveyors and the critics of sexual discourse, depending on their personal and societal conditioning. Moreover, the assertion that women are more obsessed with the reproductive function is a simplification that overlooks the complex psychological, social, and biological realities of both sexes. Women's relationship to their reproductive roles has historically been more scrutinized and laden with cultural significance, which might give the impression of an obsession when, in fact, it reflects the pressures and expectations imposed by society. Men, on the other hand, may not be as vocally or visibly connected to reproductive functions, but this does not necessarily imply a lesser engagement or interest.	1911	2006.0165
The fact that it was part of our own paper's sensation, though too late to be of political importance, decided me, and into the paper it went. This was unfortunate. For Hart had continued to believe in the genuineness of the Morey letter, as I had myself, notwithstanding all that had come out to discredit it; and as his eye fell upon the affidavit while reading Truth on election day, his flagging energies resumed full vigour. Within three hours a confidential agent was on his way to Maryland with instructions to find Lindsay and keep him in as close custody as he would submit to, until he could be delivered at Truth office.	Hart's determination was clear: he would not allow the story to dissolve into mere hearsay and rumor, not when there was a chance to solidify the evidence and present a concrete case. The stakes were too high, and his journalistic instincts too finely honed to let such an opportunity slip by. The urgency of the situation demanded swift action, and Hart was not one to dither when the integrity of his publication was on the line. As the agent made his way through the bustling streets, heading towards the train station, Hart was back in his office, pacing the floor and pulling at his cigar. He was a man accustomed to the pressures of the news cycle, but this was different. This was a story that could potentially alter the course of public opinion, a story that needed to be handled with the utmost care and precision. Meanwhile, Lindsay, unaware of the impending intrusion into his life, continued his day-to-day activities. He was a simple man, not one for the limelight, and the thought that he might soon become the center of a national controversy would have seemed far-f	1911	1968.4481

He began to regard his leather thoughtfully and whistle. Alma opened the door that shut off the kitchen from the stairs, and stepped in with an impulsive haste, as if she wanted to get it over."	Her face was pale, more from the indoor life than sickness, and her eyes had that distant look which spoke more of dreams than the present. Aunt Fellows gave her a quick, scrutinizing glance, then softened her expression. “Well, Alma, come sit down now. Dinner’s ready,” she said, gesturing to a chair beside the table. Alma nodded silently and took the offered seat, her movements slow, as if each took more effort than she could spare. Alonzo watched her quietly, his earlier joviality fading into a concerned frown. He passed her a plate piled with stew, trying to catch her eye with a gentle smile. “Thank you,” she murmured, almost inaudibly, her focus on the plate rather than her cousin. She picked at her food listlessly, her fork barely making a sound against the china. Alonzo exchanged a look with Aunt Fellows, his expression laden with unasked questions. Aunt Fellows shook her head slightly, indicating this was neither the time nor the place for such discussions. The meal continued	1913	1949.0099
Undertaking of a Person Who Offers His Services in a Professional Capacity. — Jmige Cooley in his book on Torts gives the law as laid down by the New hampshire courts, that a person who offers his services to the community generally or to an individual for employment in any professional capacity as a person of skill, contracts with his employer: (1) “That he possesses that reasonable degree of learning, skill, and experience which is ordinarily possessed by the professors of the same art or science, and which - is ordinarily regarded by the community and by those conversant with the employment as necessary and Sufficient to qualify him to engage in such business; - (2) “that he will use reasonable and ordinary care and diligence in the exertion of his skill and the application of his knowledge to accomplish the purpose for which he is employed; he does not undertake for extmordinary care or extraordinary diligence any more than he does for uncommon ski1l” ; l (3) “in stipulating to exert their skill and apply their ‘ Harmer 9, Cornelius, 5 C. B. (N. S.) ' Cooley on Torts 649. 36 1858' ‘heighten 0. Sargent, 27 N. H. 460 2 ’ mbll People 1: .	(4) “that he will execute his duty to the best of his ability with the tools and resources available to him, unless otherwise specified in his contract with the employer. However, he is not bound to use the latest or most advanced methodology unless such is customary in his field at the time of the employment.” (5) “that he will not misrepresent his skills, nor will he undertake tasks that he knows are beyond his professional capability, as such misrepresentation can lead to breach of contract and legal liability.” This framework of expectations helps to establish a clear understanding between professionals and those who employ them, ensuring that there is a mutual recognition of the scope and limitations of the professional's responsibilities. It also provides a legal standard against which the professional’s performance can be measured should disputes arise. These principles, while set forth in the context of New Hampshire law, reflect common standards in many jurisdictions concerning the conduct and liability of professionals.	1913	1949.8705
Both expressions have their good and weak points. CMS. OZS. ONE CUBIC METRE AIR 20 m 14 w 8 •10 .63, .56 ml  •M £7. 0 Figure 6. A measure of water contained in a cubic metre. Moisture distribution details must be known in a large part of the atmosphere before an accurate forecast of future weather trends can be made. Water vapour is a very small fraction of the total air, but its importance in creating weather is as great as its quantity is small.	The distribution of moisture in the atmosphere is highly variable, both spatially and temporally. This variability is influenced by many factors including geographical location, seasonal changes, and prevailing wind patterns. As water vapor rises and cools, it condenses into cloud particles, which can lead to precipitation under the right conditions. Thus, understanding the dynamics of moisture distribution is crucial for predicting not only rain but also other weather phenomena such as fog, dew, and frost. Furthermore, the interaction between moisture and temperature plays a pivotal role in the development and intensification of weather systems like cyclones and anticyclones. For instance, the influx of moist air into a low-pressure system can lead to the rapid intensification of storms, potentially resulting in severe weather events. Conversely, areas of high pressure tend to have drier air, which can lead to clear and calm weather conditions. In order to make accurate weather predictions, meteorologists use various tools and models to track the movement and concentration of moisture in the atmosphere. Satellites, weather balloons, and ground-based sensors all contribute data that is analyzed to forecast weather	1913	2005.9403
We tried some of these, and found them most delicious, as indeed were all the other eatables we consumed. Though used to a meat diet, we found this meal most satisfying; the fruits being so refreshing that we had neither desire nor need for drink, though it stood there ready for us if we wished to take it. The attendants waited upon us assiduously, bringing us '74  the various dishes in what was apparently their regular order of courses. Both John and M'Allister appeared to enjoy their first Martian meal as much as I did, and when we adjourned to another room at its conclusion, were loud in their expressions of appreciation. When this topic had died down, I thought the time had arrived to make the important disclosure of the first results of our visit to the red planet.	"""I must say, gentlemen,"" I began, settling into a more serious tone as we gathered around a low, circular table, ""that our findings here exceed all expectations. Not only have we been met with unprecedented hospitality, but the technological and cultural advancements we've observed are beyond anything we could have imagined.""  John nodded enthusiastically, his eyes wide with the excitement of discovery. ""Indeed, the architecture alone is something out of a dream. The way they harness natural energy and their methods of transportation—it's all so advanced, yet seamlessly integrated with nature."" M'Allister, who had been scribbling notes since we landed, looked up from his journal. ""And let's not overlook their social structure. There's a harmony here that I've not seen on Earth. Everyone seems to play a part in society, contributing to a greater whole without any apparent discontent."" I leaned forward, my hands clasped together. ""Precisely, and that brings me to the purpose of our mission. We need to learn from them, understand their ways. There's much that humanity can benefit from"	1911	1959.6824
Only slowly and painfully the moral and social faculties and functions ripened and the higher ethical and aesthetic forces bloomed into genuinely spiritual and inspirational powers. Incalculably rich and fecund as was the latent wealth of nature and human nature, their treasures had to be discovered, developed, controlled and rearranged to higher use, exactly as the mineral treasures beneath the earth's surface. The whole history of man is a pathetic campaign to conquer himself as much as his environment; to subdue and harmonise the untamed forces within and without him, for nobler ends; and to discover and apply such eternal principles and divine proportions as would convert chaos into cosmos, and the terrors of the jungle into the peace and beauty of the civilised home. It is clear today that man's ills were never so much due to nature's deficiencies as to his own misconception or misuse of her super abundant beneficences.	As he progressed, slowly learning the art of extracting the essence of ethical beauty from the raw complexities of life, mankind began to see that the true conquest was not of nature by brute force, but of himself by wisdom and virtue. The realisation dawned that every advance in power must be matched by an advance in moral responsibility, that every new dominion over the physical must correspond with a greater dominion over the spiritual. Thus the epic of human development transformed from a mere battle for survival into a quest for meaning, a striving towards an ideal balance between the demands of the external world and the aspirations of the inner spirit. The journey was fraught with trials, as each new discovery or innovation—be it fire, the wheel, or the written word—brought with it not just solutions, but new dilemmas, testing the moral fibre of societies. Yet, it was through these very challenges that humanity was sculpted, its virtues honed like tools to carve out civilizations that reflected not merely material success, but the depth of human understanding and compassion. In this grand narrative, art and philosophy emerged	1911	1943.274
Nine out of ten would put mathematics at the head of the list. Only the simplest arithmetical processes are in general use, however. Only an infinitesimal proportion of those who have studied algebra, plane and analytic geometry, or calculus have ever made use of them. Adding machines and computation tables keep the bulk of the world's commerce straight. But nobody has studied Latin without being or feeling himself surer of his control of a third of the words of his daily speech. I have never thought the etymological a particularly strong argument for studying Latin, but it has been given me by students of my own whom I didn't think I had succeeded in getting to learn Latin.	They have told me that their understanding of English, their capacity to grasp the meaning of words and their power of expression, have been distinctly improved by their study of Latin roots and structures. It is the structural discipline, the logical sequence and the precision demanded in Latin that trains the mind. The mental exercise involved in translating from Latin to English and vice versa enhances cognitive abilities, encouraging not just memory, but a deeper comprehension of language mechanics. Furthermore, the study of Latin literature opens a window to the history, philosophy, and culture of ancient Rome, enriching a student's general knowledge and appreciation for the foundational aspects of Western civilization. This cultural literacy is invaluable, fostering a broader perspective and a more nuanced understanding of contemporary society. Thus, while the practical applications of Latin may not be immediately obvious, the intellectual and cultural benefits it confers are profound and lasting.	1911	2001.888

Experience was to be organised with a view, not to the discovery of the secrets of the universe, but rather to the furtherance of human welfare. In a word, the philosophy, ethics, religious and historical judgments of Comte are all in one relation or another influenced by this conception. But, it will be observed, the definition of the positive method itself rests upon certain  conclusions of what is in ordinary, if not in Comtean, usage metaphysics. The distinction between phenomena and reality is a metaphysical distinction: the denial that we can know the intimate causes of phenomena a metaphysical denial : the abandonment of speculation as to the ultimate origin or purpose of things the result of a metaphysical scepticism. It represents the joint effect of Hume and Kant on the mind of the writer. Suppose now that we drop all this metaphysics and start afresh with the notion of the positive method given above and the implications shown to be involved.	What then becomes of our philosophical inquiry? We find ourselves adhering strictly to observable phenomena, to the relationships and regularities discerned within the data provided by our senses and instruments. The focus shifts from seeking ultimate causes or essences behind phenomena to understanding the laws governing them, as they present themselves to us. This empirical approach, devoid of metaphysical assumptions, emphasizes the predictability and control of natural events, which Comte saw as essential for the progress of human society. In abandoning metaphysical speculation, we do not claim that deeper causes do not exist; rather, we recognize our current limitations in accessing and understanding them. The positive method, therefore, is not a denial of the complexity of the universe but an acknowledgment of the practical boundaries of human knowledge. This pragmatic stance is aimed at enhancing human capabilities in manipulating the environment and improving societal conditions through the application of scientific knowledge. Thus, the philosophy of positivism, while rooted in a reaction against metaphysical speculation, itself becomes a tool for practical engagement with the world.

Five shots were fired with both vessels racing their fastest, the Deutschland to escape and the Iphigenia to cut her off, and the fifth shell caught the German vessel right amidships, exploding with great violence. The starboard 9.2 inch barbette simultaneously hit her three times astern, just between her fourth funnel and the mainmast, but all these shells seemed to pass right through the ship. The Deutschland doubled yet again, to  avoid the fire, but now found the Orion coming up astern. The German vessel was going about twenty-four knots, but the Orion put two 12 inch shells into her from the fore barbette before she passed out of practical range. Just then the Sirius came up from the east, and steering across the bows of the Deutschland at about 5000 yards fired in a couple of minutes about 120 6 inch shells at her, hitting her repeatedly. The arrival of this new antagonist from the east compelled the German captain to alter course afresh and make one more bid for safety.	He turned sharply towards the south, attempting to use the cover of a small islet to shield his vessel from the relentless barrage. However, the Iphigenia and Orion, sensing the maneuver, adjusted their courses to flank the Deutschland on either side. As the German ship sped southwards, the British vessels closed in, their guns thundering continuously. The Deutschland, now heavily damaged and smoking, was losing speed. Her engines, strained to their limits, began to falter under the relentless assault. The German crew worked feverishly to keep their ship moving, but the situation was growing increasingly dire. In a desperate attempt to escape, the captain ordered a smoke screen to be laid. Thick, billowing clouds of smoke poured from the Deutschland, obscuring her from the British gunners’ sight. For a moment, it seemed she might vanish into the mist and make her escape. But the British were not so easily fooled. The Sirius, circling to the north, used her superior speed to move ahead of the smoke. From this new vantage point, she could see the faint outline	1906	1975.6455
In that case the hardier men with less of the martial spirit might in the closing grapple beat the better fighters with the less endurance. In view of what has been shown the competition of white labourers and yellow is not so simple a test of human worth as some may imagine. Under good conditions the white man can best the yellow man in turning off work. But under bad conditions the yellow man can best the white man, because he can better endure spoiled food, poor clothing, foul air, noise, heat, dirt, discomfort and microbes. Reilly can outdo Ah San, but Ah San can underlive Reilly.	This duality presents a significant challenge in the socio-economic landscape, where the endurance of adverse conditions often becomes as valuable, if not more so, than the ability to excel under favorable circumstances. The implications stretch far beyond the simple dichotomy of who can outperform whom; it touches upon the resilience and adaptability of entire communities under the strain of industrial demands and environmental hardships. Thus, the question becomes not merely one of physical or even mental endurance, but of how societies structure their labor markets, protect their workers, and value human life and well-being. The competition between Reilly and Ah San symbolizes a larger, more complex interplay of cultural, economic, and environmental factors that influence labor dynamics globally. This competition underscores the necessity for policies that do not merely favor the strongest or the most enduring, but that ensure fair conditions, equitable opportunities, and respect for all workers, regardless of their origin or their capacities to withstand less-than-ideal conditions.	1911	2001.9648
"The proceedings throughout were most enjoyable, and the speeches and representative nature of the gathering provided an excellent illustration of the objects of the Society. In the course of the evening the Assistant Secretary, Mr. J. S. Dow, read out a few letters from distinguished guests who had written congratulating the Society on its progress and regretting their unavoidable absence. The President of the Royal Society had explained that only the fact of his having to hold a receplion of the Fellows on that night prevented his attendance. Mr. S. Z. de Ferranti, President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, had likewise been unavoidably detained at the last minute, and had written : "" I am very sorry that I cannot come, as I should much like to have been there to support your esteemed President."" Sir Win. Ramsay had added to his expression of regret the words, "" Please convey to the President, my old friend, and to the Council, my thanks for their kind invitation."""	"Lady Elizabeth Howard, Chairperson of the Women's Engineering Society, also sent her apologies, noting, ""It is with deep regret that I must miss this splendid gathering due to prior commitments overseas. I send my warmest regards and best wishes for a successful event."" In response to these kind words, the room filled with a warm murmur of appreciation for the well-wishers. The dinner itself was a splendid affair, with tables elegantly laid out and adorned with silver and crystal, reflecting the soft glow of candlelight. The menu featured a range of exquisite dishes, carefully selected to cater to the diverse tastes of the assembled guests. The main course, a delicately roasted pheasant accompanied by a rich truffle sauce, was particularly well received. Following the meal, the President of the Society took to the podium to deliver his address. He spoke eloquently about the achievements of the past year, highlighting the Society's successful initiatives and the strides made in promoting the field of engineering. He also outlined the challenges that lay ahead and called for continued dedication and innovation from the members. As"	1912	1939.8351
"But in all these they see and hear the handwriting and the voice of God. It is His presence that makes the world sublime and beautiful. The direct, piercing, elevating sense of this presence simplifies, enlarges, and ennobles their style, and makes it different from other nature poetry. They never lose themselves, like Theocritus and Wordsworth and Shel [86]  lay and Tennyson, in the contemplation and description of natural beauty. They see it, but they always see beyond it. Compare, for example, a modern versified translation with the psalm itself: The spacious firmament on high, With all the blue ethereal sky And spangled heavens, a shining frame, Their Great Original proclaim Addison's descriptive epithets betray a conscious effort to make a splendid picture. But the psalmist felt no need of this; a larger impulse lifted him at once into "" the grand •tyle: "" The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork."	Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun. This simplicity and directness in the expression of divine omnipresence and omnipotence is what sets the biblical poets apart. Their poetry does not merely describe the world as a beautiful spectacle; it interprets nature as a manifestation of divine law and wisdom. Each element of the natural world becomes a symbol of spiritual truth, a conduit for divine revelation. The psalmist, unlike the later poets, does not dwell on the aesthetic details for their own sake. Instead, the natural world is a canvas upon which the grandeur and majesty of God are painted. The focus is not on nature itself but on what nature reveals about the Creator. This transcendental perspective infuses their poetry with a profound sense of awe and reverence, making it a vehicle not just for artistic expression but for spiritual communion	1908	1895.3137
"When the footman was out of earshot, Newbury turned to his father, his face showing the quick feeling behind. "" Did you know that Mr. and Mrs. Bets are trying to get at Marcia?"" ""No! I thought Coryston might be endeavouring to influence her. That fellow's absolutely reckless! But what can she have to do with the Bettses themselves? Really, the questions that young women concern themselves with today!"" cried Lord William, not without vehemence. "" Marcia must surely trust you and your jiidgment in such a matter."" Newbury flushed. "" I'M certain — she will, "" he said, rather slowly, his eyes on the ground."	"""But it's this mingling with people like the Bettses that worries me. They are of a different sort, Father, and their ideas—well, they're radical, unsettling. They could turn her head with notions that are completely at odds with our values."" Lord William sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of his nose. ""I understand your concern, Newbury. It's this modern tide, pulling the youth in every direction but the right one. But remember, Marcia is intelligent and strong-willed. She won’t be easily swayed if she trusts in the foundations we've given her."" Newbury nodded, though the line between his brows deepened. ""I know, I know. It's just that—well, I fear that these new ideas might seem... enticing to someone like Marcia. She has always had a heart for the underdog, a desire to right wrongs. And the Bettses, they have a way of making their radicalism sound like noble crusade."" ""Perhaps,"" Lord William suggested, ""it might be wise to speak openly"	1913	1983.2294
The fact that shadows are cast by trains standing at platforms when large units of lights were used is one of considerable importance, and should be carefully born in mind, as these shadows occur at a very dangerous point, namely, the edge of the platform. Mr. Grove's remarks were of special value, being based on the results of their actual experiments, the figures relating to the saving which resulted from the replacement of arc lamps by tungsten lamps being particularly interesting. The question of illuminating advertisements was of course important, but could hardly be considered as part of the station lighting, as it should be charged against advertising revenue.	Furthermore, the placement of these advertisements and their lighting needs to be strategically considered so as not to interfere with essential visibility for safety purposes. It is imperative that the illumination of adverts does not cast additional shadows or create glare that could distract or impair the vision of passengers navigating the platforms.  Mr. Grove also emphasized the need for a balance between adequate illumination for safety and the aesthetic aspects of lighting which can enhance the passenger experience. This balance is crucial in areas such as ticket halls and waiting areas where both functionality and ambiance are important.  In addition to safety and aesthetics, the efficiency of station lighting is also a critical factor. The transition to energy-efficient lighting such as LED technology not only provides better and more controllable light but also significantly reduces the energy consumption and costs associated with station lighting.  The integration of motion sensors was another point raised by Mr. Grove, suggesting that lighting in less frequented areas of the station could be controlled based on occupancy, thereby further reducing unnecessary energy usage while maintaining safety standards. Overall, the discussions highlighted the complex interplay of factors that need to be considered in the	1912	2002.4114
In this country the most valuable contribution to the subject has been the Keport of the Massachusetts Old Age Pension Commission, a report due in large measure to the energy and careful work of its chairman. Pensions, as we discus them today, are characteristic of modern civilization. This is necessarily so. A pension system can not be valued unless it promises security, and it is only within recent history that institutions and governments have attained to any great degree of security. In the ancient world pensions are hardly met with except in the bounties paid to discharged soldiers. In the Middle Ages the church, the only stable institution, fixed no age limit for its servants, but relieved their old age by coadjutors and assistants rather than by retirement. The modern pension systems appeared in the nineteenth century and have shown rapid growth.	The earliest schemes were generally initiated for military personnel, as governments sought to provide for those who had served their nations in times of conflict. These early pensions were often meager and conditional, but they laid the groundwork for more comprehensive systems. By the mid-to-late 1800s, as industrialization progressed and the nature of work and life expectancy changed, the concept began to extend to civilian employees, particularly those in public service. Germany led the way with the introduction of the Old Age and Disability Insurance Law in 1889 under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. This system was revolutionary in that it provided compulsory insurance for workers, which included pensions for those over seventy years old. This model sparked interest and debate across Europe and North America, influencing other nations to consider similar measures. In the United States, the movement towards social security gathered pace in the early 20th century amidst growing concerns about poverty among the elderly. The stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression brought a sharper focus on the need for a safety net for the aged. This culminated in the Social	1911	1989.9585
Still, let no man deceive himself by imagining that the victory has been won. The world is yet very largely under the dominance of men who love the murder game of nations. The lust for military glory and personal power and the lust for killing are still a potent force in many minds among those who aspire to leadership; while there is always a large section of society which is easily influenced by alarmist cries and senti  455 mental appeals to prejudice. Men who find it impossible to refrain from shooting down mild eyed fawns for the sheer joy of killing, and who find no shame in boasting of shooting an enemy on the battlefield who is beating a hasty retreat, will still be heard talking of there being questions that cannot be settled by peaceful or constitutional methods; but the best thought of the world is rapidly leaving behind the men who represent the spirit of slaughter.	The tide is turning, albeit slowly, towards a greater appreciation of peace and diplomacy in resolving international disputes. The growing influence of international law and the establishment of bodies like the League of Nations are testament to this shift. Intellectuals, humanitarians, and a new generation of political leaders are increasingly vocal in their condemnation of war as a method for settling differences. Educational systems across the world are beginning to emphasize the values of peace, cooperation, and understanding among nations.  Moreover, the horrors and the wastefulness of war, so vividly demonstrated in recent conflicts, have served to awaken many to the futility and the immense cost of such ventures. Economies shattered, generations decimated, and societies torn apart by war are compelling arguments that resonate deeply in the public consciousness. The push for disarmament and the negotiation of peace treaties are gaining ground as more people recognize that true progress lies not in conquest and domination, but in peaceful coexistence and mutual respect. As we move forward, it becomes crucial to support and strengthen these mechanisms and institutions that promote peace. The challenge lies in maintaining the momentum	1911	1992.4087
If this could be held strongly, as was intended, by practically the whole of the British forces located in the South of England, including the Yeomanry, Militia, and Volunteers — who were now all massing in every direction — then the deadly peril threatening England might be averted. But could it be held ? ye, WILHELM, GIVE NOTICE to the inhabitants of those provinces occupied by the German Imperial Army, that — I MAKE WAR upon the soldiers, and not upon English citizens. Consequently, it is my wish to give the latter and their property entire security, and as long as they do not embark upon hostile enterprise against the German troops they have a right to my protection.	Nevertheless, should the inhabitants presume to take up arms or engage in any form of sabotage, they shall be treated as belligerents and subjected to the rigors of military law. It is imperative that all persons comply strictly with these directives, and any failure to adhere to them will result in severe repercussions. Our forces are prepared, and while we seek not to bring harm to the innocent, we will not hesitate to enforce control and maintain order. The military commanders have been instructed to act with discipline but also with the necessary firmness to ensure the security of our operations. To the leaders of the local communities, I urge cooperation. It is in your best interest to dissuade your people from any rash actions. Encourage them to maintain peace and order within their ranks. This will facilitate a more harmonious coexistence during our presence and will expedite our eventual withdrawal. For the duration of military operations, a curfew from sunset to sunrise will be enforced. All citizens must remain indoors during these hours or risk being suspected of hostile intentions. Essential movements during curfew must be pre-approved by	1906	1913.9562
"Will the people act rashly, be subject to waves of passion and pass anything proposed ? twenty-three measures were rejected; nine were adopted. Curiously enough, the only ""socialistic"" measure on the ballot was the proposal of the business men for state railroads, which was defeated. 119 The whole is a conservative showing. Will they take an interest and vote on the measures? Comparing the vote cast on the measures with the total vote cast for candidates in the election, we note the fact that it varies from 62 to 90. General average, 71 percent. Excluding the county division bills, which were local, the average on state wide problems stands at 75 percent, which is the general average on all measures decided since the introduction of the system in 1902. But what of the 25 percent who do not vote on measures — who are they ?"	Are they simply disinterested or perhaps overwhelmed by the complexity of the issues at hand? It is conceivable that this segment of the electorate feels disconnected from the political process, or perhaps lacks the information necessary to make educated decisions on the ballot measures. This raises important questions about the accessibility and transparency of information regarding these measures. Are the proposals clearly and effectively communicated to the public? Is there adequate public education on the implications and potential outcomes of these measures? Furthermore, it could be argued that the 25 percent who abstain from voting on measures represent a significant portion of the population whose voices are not being heard. This could indicate a need for reforms in how these measures are presented and debated in public forums. Perhaps more engaging and inclusive approaches, such as community discussions, town hall meetings, and better use of digital platforms could help bridge the gap between the electorate and the issues at stake. Moreover, it is essential to consider the role of voter fatigue in this scenario. With an increasing number of measures appearing on the ballot, voters may feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of decisions they are required to make. This	1911	1993.9854
"A privileged governing class has a tendency to make laws which will strengthen its position against the rest of the community. The submission of the community to the privileges of the governing class rested upon the force at the command of the governing class. There has been no such thing in history as government by consent, in the real sense of that word, of the people. There has been no community in which each person had the same opportunity of education, or the same economic chances. Until such a community is developed, one cannot test the truth of "" government by consent of the people."" All governing classes have gained their privileges through the ignorance of the people. There are many degrees of ignorance. As some individual members of the community acquired knowledge, it was possible that the dominance of the governing class might be challenged. All governments have feared the spread of knowledge."	"This fear has often led to the suppression of free speech and the control of educational systems to maintain the status quo. Throughout history, the dissemination of knowledge has been a battleground, with those in power seeking to limit access to information that could incite change or threaten their authority. The printing press, the establishment of public schools, and the advent of the internet are all pivotal moments where access to information expanded dramatically, each bringing its own set of challenges to established powers. The notion of a truly democratic society, where each individual has equal access to knowledge and thus the power to make informed decisions, remains an ideal. The struggle against educational disparity, economic inequality, and political disenfranchisement continues to be central in the quest for genuine ""government by consent of the people."" As long as significant portions of the population are kept in conditions of ignorance, whether through lack of educational opportunities, systemic poverty, or biased media, true democracy remains elusive. In modern times, the role of media and the internet has become increasingly significant in this dynamic. The ability to control or influence the flow of information can sway"	1911	2005.5406
Mary Agnew received her husband with an air of comprehensive forgiveness which touched and cheered him. She was sad, it seemed, but gave every token of love and devotion. In the course of the evening, as she was stripping off little Berry man's underpinning, she sighed and said she was glad she had named the child for his father. She thought when a man died it was nice to leave a son behind with the same name to comfort his mother. Agnew stared at her in astonishment. He had no means of knowing that she had sacrificed the price of their oldest little girl's commencement frock to pay the first instalment on his coffin, which was plain, with nickel mountings, but warranted to last as long or longer than any rosewood casket on the market. A week later Sally Bowman gave her annual quilting.	"At this gathering, the women of the community came together, their fingers nimble as they stitched and their tongues just as swift, sharing news and gossip as their hands busily worked the fabric. Mary Agnew, despite the recent shadows in her life, attended with a quiet grace, contributing to the hum of voices with a gentle, if somewhat subdued, presence. As the quilting progressed, conversation inevitably turned to the topic of Berryman’s namesake and the legacy a father leaves behind. The women nodded in agreement, acknowledging the sentiment with murmurs of approval. It was a community that held family ties in high regard, and the idea of continuity through names was a cherished tradition. Sally Bowman, ever the observant hostess, noticed the wistfulness in Mary’s eyes as she spoke of her husband and son. Later, as they shared a pot of strong tea, Sally gently prodded, ""You’ve been carrying a heavy load, Mary. If there’s anything we can do..."" Mary smiled, a small, fleeting thing. ""Thank you, Sally. It’s"	1913	1999.8588
Especially is this spiritual power manifest when we recall that so many ages of philosophers and teachers have gravely told us that the loss of belief in another life would destroy the nobility in men. And furthermore, I am aware of the sublimity in this conception of impersonal immortality, as it is presented to us by Professor Zueblin in the book I have mentioned, or better still in that great classic of George Eliot's from which I quote above; or in that other classical expression in favour of impersonal immortality, that of Shelley over his friend Keats, when he says, in Adonais: He is made one with Nature! there is heard His voice in all her music, from the moan Of thunder to the song of night's sweet bird; He is a presence to be felt and known In darkness, and in light, from herb and stone, Spreading itself wherever that Power may move Which has withdrawn his being to its own.	Which wields the world with never-wearied love, Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above. This vision of merging into the natural world does not negate the individual life lived, but rather transcends it, offering a form of continuation that is beyond the personal. It suggests a unity with the cosmos that many find deeply comforting and spiritually profound. The essence of one's being, according to this view, contributes to the ongoing creation and harmony of the universe. It is a form of eternal influence, where the impact of one's life resonates through time and space long after the individual consciousness has ceased. In this broader perspective, the fear of personal extinction is mitigated by the belief in a lasting legacy — not in the sense of monuments or fame, but through the subtle and enduring influences that one's life has woven into the fabric of existence. It is a form of immortality that celebrates the interconnectedness of all life and the ongoing dance of creation and dissolution. This philosophical stance challenges us to live lives of meaning and connection, knowing that our actions ripple outward in countless	1911	1991.6195
As my Aunt did not mention that we sd accompany that Lady, we imagined we should be rather troublesome than otherwise. We are sorry to have given occasion for your anger, and hope you will not deny us your pardon. Mra Descombes is this instant returned and has made me very imhappy indeed by repeating to me some part of this morning's conversation at the Adelphi and showing me a letter that came from Paris. The idea you have of my still corresponding with M. de Moliere is indeed very unjust, and I am sure, did you but know, or even conceive, half the pain and trouble that are locked up in my bosom, far from abandoning me, as you threaten, you would give me all the assistance in your power. . . .	I implore you, dear Sir, to reconsider your thoughts on this matter. The correspondence with M. de Moliere has long since ended, and any letters that may still come are but echoes of a past that I have earnestly striven to leave behind. My heart has been burdened with more than its share of sorrow and misunderstanding, and your support in these trying times would be the balm that my weary spirit so desperately needs. I assure you, the last thing I wish is to cause discord or to bring distress upon those whom I hold dear. It is my greatest hope that we can move past these misunderstandings and that I can prove to you the sincerity of my intentions and the purity of my actions. Let us not allow shadows of the past to cloud the warmth and affection that should bind us. I remain, ever your devoted and distressed niece, hoping for nothing more than your understanding and forgiveness.	1912	1889.1199
I associate the one idea with the other without referring it to any past. It enters into the filling of my present perception. These after images of the past may at the same time  give content to our view of the future. Then we have  ideas of expectation which we refer to the future event in  the same way as we referred the memory ideas to the past. 11 149   Those expectations are also made up of earlier experiences, but their combination is controlled by our future actions. The purpose is thus a different one. We expect that the blackboard will be on the wall of the schoolroom tomorrow with the same certainty with which we remember its being there yesterday.	This expectation, however, is not merely a passive extension of memory; it is actively shaped by our intentions and plans. We engage in a sort of mental construction, using the materials of past experiences to build a model of what we anticipate will occur. This process is not static but dynamic, involving a continuous adjustment of our expectations based on new information and experiences as they arise. Furthermore, the certainty of our expectations can vary significantly. While some predictions are made with great confidence, others are tentatively held and subject to change. This variability is influenced by the strength and relevance of the past experiences we draw upon, as well as the stability and predictability of the environment in which the expected events are to take place. Thus, while memory anchors us to the past, expectation orients us toward the future, both processes deeply intertwined with the continuous flow of our conscious experience. By navigating between these two poles, we are able to adapt and plan, learning from what has been and anticipating what is yet to come.	1909	1992.3359
But our psychology has found for us no way to premeditate psychical creative activity or sensibility, though these are the essential elements of our spiritual life. Nor can we any more than the ancients dissociate anything in the life of the soul from the Divine Purpose, it being understood that neither in that Purpose nor in the creative life of the soul is there any teleological plan such as enters into our arbitrary undertakings. Our human experience, regarded in its continuity, is not a mere fabric built into the world, materially embodied and mentally fashioned to conform to external relations and demands; it has been a living growth, beyond physiological functioning. The soul holds the secret of this life, whatever its setting in matter or in the mind.	And so the soul's endeavors, its aspirations and its struggles, are not to be measured by the yardstick of physical laws or by the tangible outcomes they produce. The true essence of spiritual life is far more profound, existing in a realm where cause and effect are woven with threads of meaning and purpose that transcend ordinary understanding. This deeper comprehension of our existence often eludes the grasp of empirical science, which, while invaluable in its domain, operates primarily within the confines of observable phenomena and quantifiable data. The rich tapestry of human experience—our joys, sorrows, hopes, and fears—thus belongs to a different order of reality, one that is shaped by the soul's inner dynamics and its interaction with the divine. Here, in the quiet recesses of our being, the soul shapes its own destiny, influenced by but not confined to the physical and psychological conditions of life. It is in this inner sanctuary that we encounter the true self, the core of our identity, which partakes of the eternal and the infinite. In this light, the pursuit of understanding our spiritual life demands a	1913	1970.1512
Morning found me aboard, bound for '. le guillotine sec!' as Lamartine described Cayenne a half century ago. Cayenne — red pepper to the world at large, hell to the few thousands of convicts transported to this isolated, northeastern corner of equatorial South America. Here, it was rumoured, existed one of the world's most antiquated and revolting penal systems, where thousands of men are not only transported for years, but exiled and doomed to a living death. Men from French Guiana had intimated conditions which vied with the cruelties of the old convict ships. I understood the system was legalised by progressive, intellectual France, under the Minister of Colonies, and that prison - reform movements in France had unsuccessfully tried to do away with the horrors of Cayenne.	The journey to Cayenne was long and arduous, filled with a sense of foreboding. The ship cut through the Atlantic waters, carrying its human cargo to an uncertain fate. As I stood on the deck, the salty air mingled with whispers of despair from my fellow passengers, each bound for a different reason to this infamous land. Some were criminals, convicted of heinous crimes, while others were political prisoners, exiled for their beliefs or actions that had displeased the government. Upon arrival, the oppressive heat of the tropics was immediate, enveloping everything with its stifling embrace. The port of Cayenne loomed before us, a town that seemed to cling desperately to civilization at the edge of a vast and unyielding jungle. The architecture was a mix of colonial French buildings, weathered and worn by the harsh climate, and simpler, makeshift structures that spoke of a transient population. As we disembarked, guards awaited the prisoners, their faces impassive as they herded the men into waiting vehicles. I was allowed to pass as a free man, albeit one	1913	1951.9589
Wages in France and England. — In this reply Mr. Lewis has put his finger upon one of the only points of sound criticism which I have had for some time past. I believe that our Board of Trade index numbers do very fairly indicate the variations as regards the conditions of the working classes in this country, but quite agree that the French figures are much less carefully compiled. So far as the figures accepted by the Board of Trade are concerned, the evidence is entirely in my favour, and I do not know of any other figures which could be adopted in place, but I have no desire to unduly press a point which depends considerably upon individual preferences in compiling the figures.	However, it must be acknowledged that even within these constraints, the trends shown by the Board of Trade index numbers do suggest that the conditions for the working classes in England have seen gradual improvement. This is in contrast to the situation in France, where the data, though less robust, indicates a more stagnant, if not deteriorating, situation for their working populace. It is imperative, therefore, that in discussions of wage comparisons and economic conditions across countries, we recognize the limitations and variations in data collection methods and the consequent impacts on the reliability of such comparisons. Further scrutiny and perhaps a harmonization of data collection methodologies could provide a clearer, more accurate picture. This would not only aid in a fairer comparative analysis but also ensure that policy decisions are made on the basis of reliable data. For now, while the data serves as a rough indicator, caution should be exercised in drawing too definitive conclusions from these figures alone.	1911	1990.4237
Owner Not Liable for Misconduct of His Architect. — In general, no action will lie against the owner for misconduct of his architect who has been employed merely to prepare plans and specifications and to procure a builder to erect the building. In a case where an architect had made an ‘ Merriit 1; . mcnally (Mont), 36 Pac. semble Gilman 0. Stevens, 54 How. Pr. 197 Rep. 44. [1877]. ' Newman 0. Fowler, 37 N. J. Law 89 (8 5 Gaither 0. Myrick, 9 Mo. 118; Lamplray Vroom) [1874].	Harris v. Jones, 23 Ill. App. 345 [1886]; and Dorr v. Fisher, 1 Caines' Rep. 17 [1803]. These cases illustrate the principle that the owner is not responsible for the independent acts of the architect beyond the scope of mere agency in planning and supervision. The architect, being a professional, is held to a standard of care and expertise in his own right, and his failure to meet this standard does not typically extend liability to the owner unless the owner has specific knowledge of and complicity in the negligent acts. Furthermore, where the owner has given the architect complete autonomy in the decision-making process regarding the design and construction, the courts have generally upheld that the architect's actions are not to be legally imputed to the owner. This separation of responsibilities ensures that the owner's liability is limited to his direct actions and engagements. However, it is crucial for owners to exercise due diligence in the selection of architects. They should ensure that the architects they hire are duly qualified and capable of performing the tasks required. Should an owner neglig	1913	1947.2698
is 9 times as great, or -03 of the total power. Under these circumstances the area required per hp. becomes '84 sq. ft. instead of 2*5 sq. ft. at the 50 ft./sec. velocity, an advantage that probably fully compensates the designer for the increased hp. loss. The question of air cooling appears under a new light altogether. A motor of 50 hp. has commonly assigned to it an area of approximately 16 sq.	ft. for effective cooling under normal operating conditions. However, with the increased velocity of 100 ft./sec., the required area drastically reduces to around 4.2 sq. ft., demonstrating a significant improvement in the efficiency of cooling mechanisms. This reduction not only simplifies the design constraints but also potentially reduces the overall weight and cost of the motor assembly. Consequently, when designing systems where airflow can be controlled and maximized, such as in automotive or aerospace applications, it becomes essential to consider these dynamics. The enhanced airflow at higher velocities can substantially decrease the necessary surface area for heat dissipation, leading to more compact and economically favorable designs. This shift in required cooling surface area due to increased air velocity underscores the importance of aerodynamic considerations in the engineering process, highlighting how subtle changes in operating conditions can have outsized effects on design and functionality.	1912	1994.1581
"The remaining illustration is interesting as showing how very simple recognised were it not for the piece of cardboard set up to mark the place. Taking a hint from The Illuminating Engineer, Mr. Greenslade added a white coating to the step, and carried this some distance up the wall, as shown in the illustration on the right. This proves quite sufficient to enable people to see the step and avoid stumbling. Projecting Illuminated Signs and Lamps. IN a recent number of The Jourtial of ga s Lighting particulars are given of an interesting case relating to some projecting signs outside the premises of the Clark Bread Company, Brighton. The Brighton Council demanded the removal of these signs, which consisted simply in gas lamps having the name "" Clark "" shown on them. It was contended that these came under the head of projecting signs, and that the Council had a right to demand their removal. The position is a peculiar one."	The Council argued that such signs, being illuminated and projecting beyond the usual line of the shop front, could pose a hazard to pedestrians and traffic, and were therefore disallowed under the current city ordinances. Mr. Greenslade, representing the Clark Bread Company, contended that these signs were essential for the business to attract nighttime customers and were designed in such a manner that they did not protrude more than was necessary for visibility and illumination. He further argued that the signs were securely fastened and maintained, posing no more risk than any typical street signage. The case eventually went before a local magistrate, where lengthy discussions ensued about the nature of public walkways and the rights of business owners versus the regulatory duties of the council. During the proceedings, experts in city planning and public safety were called upon to testify about the potential risks and benefits of such illuminated signs. The magistrate, upon reviewing all arguments and evidence, decided that while the signs did indeed project, they did not significantly impede the public way nor present undue danger to the public. As a result, the magistrate ruled in favor of the Clark	1912	1952.0394
"Indeed, in the health reports the two diseases were classed together up to 1738."" Lest any one should question the statement that smallpox was not considered by the medical profession as a particularly dangerous disease before the era of inoculation, we desire to cite the words of Thomas Sydenham, M. D., one of the most illustrious physicians and authors of the seventeenth century and one of the greatest medical authorities of the Anglo Saxon world. Dr. Sydenham, who is frequently called the father of English medicine, in writing of smallpox in the last half of the seventeenth century, said: ""It is clear to me, from all the observations I can possibly make, that if no mischief be done by physician or nurse, it is the most light and safe of all diseases Now following on the heels of this observation, made by the most distinguished regular doctor of the seventeenth century and at a time when measles and smallpox were being classed together in medical reports, some so called scientific physicians conceived the idea that if a person should be treated medically until his blood was cleansed of impurities and •See works of Thomas Sydenham, M. D., Vol."	II, p. 341. — it might be possible to prevent or significantly lessen the impact of smallpox. This line of thought led eventually to the practice of variolation, which involved intentionally infecting a person with smallpox in a controlled manner to induce immunity. This practice was based on the observations that those who survived a natural case of smallpox generally did not contract the disease again. Thus, as the 18th century dawned, the practice of variolation began to spread, particularly after reports of its success in the Ottoman Empire reached Western Europe. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, was a particularly influential advocate after witnessing the procedure in Constantinople. Upon her return to England in 1721, she had her own children variolated, which was a controversial move that caught the attention of the medical community and the public at large. Despite initial resistance, variolation gained acceptance and was practiced widely across Europe until Edward Jenner's development of a safer vaccination method using cowpox in 1796, which marked the	1911	1962.7926
In the eighties the possibility of flies carrying disease germs was called to the attention of physicians and the public. In 1898 we find what is perhaps the first reference tg observations on the house fly's frequenting typhoid excreta, and thence flying to food, and the statement that bacterial cultures were obtained from both fly tracks and fly specks. Closely following this, in 1899, came the outbreak of typhoid amongst our soldiers in camp at Porto Principe, and Major Reed's report to the War Department that the epidemic was due to flies.	This revelation marked a turning point in the understanding of disease transmission and the role of common insects in such processes. The subsequent studies and experiments led by Major Walter Reed and his colleagues during the Spanish-American War further established the connection between flies and the spread of typhoid fever. Their work showed conclusively that flies that had access to typhoid-contaminated waste could transfer the bacteria to food or water supplies, thereby infecting individuals who consumed these contaminated resources. Following these pivotal findings, public health strategies began to incorporate measures aimed at controlling fly populations and reducing their contact with disease-causing agents. Sanitation practices were improved, especially in military camps and urban areas, to limit the breeding grounds for flies. These efforts included the proper disposal of waste and excreta, the installation of screens in windows and doors to prevent flies from entering food storage and preparation areas, and educational campaigns to raise awareness about the risks associated with flies and the importance of maintaining clean environments. The impact of these interventions was significant, leading to a reduction in the incidence of diseases like typhoid fever in areas where they	1911	2004.2675

Normally it depends on election by the members of the ruling (warrior) caste."	However, in some cases, the succession might also be influenced by lineage, with the eldest son or the most capable relative of the deceased king being preferred. This method helps maintain a semblance of continuity and stability within the kingdom, which is crucial for its survival amidst internal strife and external threats. The elected or designated successor often has to prove his worthiness through various tests of strength, wisdom, and leadership, which are designed to showcase his ability to lead his people in times of peace and war. The complexities of these succession practices reflect the intricate balance of power and the need for a capable leader to navigate the challenges that these communities face. The rituals surrounding the selection process are steeped in tradition and are integral to the cultural fabric of the society. These ceremonies not only reaffirm the community's allegiance to their leader but also reinforce the social hierarchies and responsibilities that govern their interactions. As the new leader takes his place at the head of the community, he inherits not only the authority but also the responsibilities that come with the position. His leadership will be tested through his decisions in managing the community	1908	1979.7555
Now, when a previous query had been put as to why the sciences are not taught in Arabic to Egyptians, the answer was that the books did not exist. Thus the demand for rational justice is by our bureaucracy in Egypt dodged from pillar from post. The whole procedure is one of evasion — I do not mean on the part of the Foreign Secretary, who simply puts forward the case given him by the Egyptian autocracy — but on the part of that autocracy. The British control has lasted for over twenty years : and the French entente, which gave the Consul-General a free hand, has lasted for four years. If then it were desired to convey scientific knowledge in Arabic, new books could have been produced ten times over. The only remaining pretext is the implicit proposition that the Arabic language is incapable of evolving scientific terms; and that is flat absurdity.	The Arabic language has a rich and extensive history as a vessel for science and philosophy, one that stretches back to the Golden Age of Islam, where scholars in the Middle East were pioneers in fields such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and chemistry. Arabic was the lingua franca of the scientific community much like English is today. The works of Ibn Sina in medicine, Al-Khwarizmi in algebra, and Ibn Al-Haytham in optics, all penned in Arabic, laid foundational stones for modern science. Moreover, the structure of the Arabic language, with its vast vocabulary and flexible syntax, is more than capable of adapting modern scientific terminology. Many contemporary terms have already been successfully integrated into the language. Universities across the Arab world teach science in Arabic, producing capable graduates who contribute both locally and globally. The real issue, then, is not the language but perhaps a lack of will or resources devoted to developing and standardizing scientific education in Arabic within Egypt. This involves investment in updating and creating new textbooks, training educators to teach science in Arabic, and encouraging a scientific community that publishes	1908	2002.2186
"Browning, however, seems to be unaware of any such attribution. In speaking of the mayor of Saint rambert, he says: "" Dry goods he deals in, grocery beside."" The other word referred to is the adjective rare, as designating meat partially cooked. The corresponding English term is underdone. The history of the former is essentially the same as that just given of fall. Both rare and underdone are used in the two countries; in each, one is heard regularly, the other infrequently. Very many absurd derivations have been concocted for the word now generally regarded as an Americanism. It is hardly necessary to say that it is quite as distinct in its origin as in its meaning from the more common term derived from the Latin rarus."	"The term ""rare"" in its culinary context, indeed, traces back to the Old English 'hrēr,' meaning lightly cooked or underdone, primarily referring to the texture and readiness of meat. This usage distinctly separates it from 'rarus,' which suggests something sparse or infrequent. Thus, the culinary application of ""rare"" has maintained a consistent lineage in English, diverging significantly from the Latin root that some mistakenly connect it to. In the culinary traditions of both Britain and America, the preference and terminology can vary regionally but the essential understanding remains. ""Rare"" meat is appreciated for retaining more of its natural juices and flavors, considered by many gourmets to enhance the dining experience. This contrasts with ""well-done,"" where the meat is thoroughly cooked until no pink meat remains, often leading to a tougher texture. This divergence in cooking terminology highlights not only linguistic evolution but also cultural differences in culinary preferences. As such, while ""rare"" and ""underdone"" may be used interchangeably in some contexts, each word carries its own history and connotations,"	1913	2004.6437
This is done by tabulating C in the equation M=C.b.APvt where M is the moment and b the length of the chord of the aerofoil. It follows from the above definitions, that to obtain pressures, forces, or moments from the absolute values tabulated it is necessary to multiply by pv', Apt' or b.A.pv1 respectively. When using foot, pound, second units the value of p for air is 0.00238 at 15° C. and 760 mm. Pressures, forces, and moments obtained in this way will then be in pounds per square foot, pounds, and foot pounds, respectively. It was stated in the previous report that C is theoretically not necessarily constant (for a particular angle of incidence), but is more generally some function of LVjv*.	The variability of C can be attributed to several factors including changes in air density, temperature, and the speed at which the aerofoil is moving. These variations can influence the behavior of the aerofoil under different flight conditions. Therefore, it is crucial for aeronautical engineers to consider these factors when designing and testing aircraft to ensure optimal performance and safety. Furthermore, the relationship between lift coefficient (C_L) and drag coefficient (C_D) must be carefully balanced to achieve efficient flight. The lift-to-drag ratio, which is a critical parameter in aeronautical engineering, is directly influenced by the values of C_L and C_D. Optimizing this ratio is essential for reducing fuel consumption and enhancing the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. In practical applications, engineers often use wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to determine the behavior of C under various conditions. These methods allow for adjustments and refinements in the aerofoil design, leading to more accurate predictions of aerodynamic performance. It is also noteworthy that the concept of Reynolds number, which is a dimensionless	1912	2000.1454
It would appear from the experiments above described that if it be desired to use the struts as the equivalent of a positive vertical fin the fineness ratio should not be less than 4£ to 1, or perhaps 5 to 1 to allow for irregularities of construction. If the fin effect of the struts is to be neglected but the resistance is desired to be as low as posssible, the fineness ratio should not be less than 2£ or 3 to 1, and in these cases the fin effect will be always in the same direction as that of a real fin, but liable practically to vanish at high angles of yaw. If the fineness ratio is less than 2J the behaviour of the struts will be very erratic, depending on slight errors of construction. The drift will be very high and what fin effect there is will probably be in the opposite direction to that due to a real fin. For Tables see next page. 113 Tests of Struts of an Aeroplane of BBi type (see Fig. 1). After wing strut.	The results of these tests, conducted under varying wind speeds and angles, indicate that the aerodynamic performance of the struts significantly impacts the overall stability and control of the aircraft. The tests were carried out in a controlled environment using a scaled model of the BBi type aeroplane, focusing particularly on the after wing strut, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and aerodynamic efficiency of the wing assembly. Table 1 summarizes the drag coefficients and corresponding fin effects observed at different fineness ratios: | Fineness Ratio | Drag Coefficient | Fin Effect Description | |----------------|------------------|------------------------| | 5:1      | 0.025      | Stable, acts as a positive vertical fin | | 3:1      | 0.045      | Reduced fin effect, minimal drift | | 2.5:1     | 0.065      | Negligible fin effect, acceptable drift | | <2.5:1     | 0.085      | Erratic behavior, high drift, inverse fin effect | From the data,	1912	2001.8182
Whirlwinds and tornadoes assume some of the characteristics of pressure gradient versus centrifugal force circulation, but the tornado particularly is intense beyond comparison with the hurricane. In both clockwise and counter clockwise wind patterns at least two of the three forces arc universally active with varying degrees of magnitude. In the straight isobar type of wind pattern, the centrifugal force drops  out entirely, leaving the deflective force to balance the pressure gradient Winds wherein all three forces are active are known as Gradient Winds; winds wherein the centrifugal force is absent are known as Geostrophic Winds; winds wherein the deflective force is absent are known as Cyclo strophic Winds. These constitute nearly all the horizontal winds of the' globe. PRESSURE GRADIENT AND WIND VELOCITY.	The relationship between pressure gradient and wind velocity is fundamental to understanding wind dynamics. The pressure gradient is the rate of change in atmospheric pressure across a given distance and is the primary driving force behind wind movement. As the pressure gradient increases, so does the wind velocity, assuming other factors remain constant. This relationship is governed by the Gradient Wind equation, which balances the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect (deflective force), and the centrifugal force in a curved flow. In regions where the pressure gradient is steep, such as at the edges of high and low pressure systems, winds tend to be stronger. Conversely, areas with a shallow pressure gradient generally experience lighter winds. This principle is evident in the rapid winds associated with hurricanes and tornadoes, where extremely low pressure centers create intense pressure gradients. Moreover, the direction of the wind is influenced by the Coriolis effect, which causes winds to turn to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, relative to their direction of travel. This deflection results in winds that spiral out of high-pressure areas and into	1913	1992.1064
"As a matter of fact, such a filter, when used with a very strong source of light — as, for instance, an electric lamp — lets through traces of green and violet; but for all that, these "" adulterants, "" the intensity of which is only about 1 1'oooth that of the ultra violet rays, do no damage. Especially interesting are the effects of fluorescence which are produced by the ultra violet rays, as Dr. Lehmann was able to show very plainly with the help of his filters. The number of these phenomena is exceptionally large, but they do not ordinarily appear, because they are too weak and are hidden by the light."	For example, certain minerals and organic substances, when exposed to ultraviolet light, exhibit vivid colors that are otherwise invisible under normal lighting conditions. This characteristic fluorescence is not only a fascinating visual experience but also serves practical purposes in scientific research and industry. Dr. Lehmann demonstrated that by using his specialized filters, it was possible to observe the subtle fluorescence of substances like quinine sulfate, which emits a bright blue glow, or the eerie green of uranium glass. These observations are critical in fields such as mineralogy and chemistry, where they can indicate the presence of specific compounds or impurities. Moreover, the study of fluorescence under ultraviolet light has significant implications in the field of biology and medicine. For instance, certain biomolecules can be tagged with fluorescent markers and tracked under UV light, providing insights into cellular processes and disease mechanisms. This application has led to advancements in diagnostics and therapeutic interventions, highlighting the profound impact of Dr. Lehmann's work with ultraviolet filters beyond mere academic curiosity.	1912	2001.2211
On uplands, it has been successfully cultivated, but in such situations in is generally unprofitable and frequently an entire failure. It may be laid down as a rule that the soil in which this plant is to thrive must be liberally supplied with water, and yet the land must be so drained that the water can be drawn off to at least ten inches be  Fig 129. Common' cranberry Foil low the surface. The best ag and fruit; about one half cranberry bogs are so .	constructed that the water level can be controlled with precision. They are typically located in areas with a natural peat base or are manually layered with sand and peat to create the ideal growing conditions. The sand aids in drainage and also helps in the control of certain pests and diseases that are common to cranberry crops. The management of water is critical, not only for the growth phase but also for protecting the plants during winter and for harvesting. In autumn, the bogs are flooded to facilitate the harvesting process, as cranberries float, making them easier to collect. This flooding must be carefully timed and monitored to prevent damage to the plants. Moreover, cranberries require an acidic soil, with a pH typically between 4.0 and 5.5. This acidic environment helps to suppress the growth of many weed species which would otherwise compete with the cranberries for nutrients. Regular testing and, if necessary, adjustment of soil pH is an essential part of cranberry bog management. To ensure a successful crop, growers must also be vigilant about pests and diseases. Integrated pest management strategies, including the use	1914	2006.2858
The fruit industry is especially suited to the man of    ready resources who can quickly adapt himself to changes of situation. Choice of Locations. Most people who are making a specialty of fruit growing, and most farmers who contemplate a change to fruit growing, are held fast by social ties, by land holdings or in other ways, so that they cannot easily change their location even if they wished to do so, therefore the choice of location for them is a settled fact. If they engage in fruit growing at all it must be in their present surroundings. To them it is a selection of crops and methods of management best suited to their conditions. If fruit growing cannot be made profitable where they are they had better devote their land to other purposes.	However, for those who have the freedom to choose their location, several factors must be considered to ensure the success of a fruit-growing venture. The climate is paramount; different fruits require specific climatic conditions to thrive. For instance, citrus fruits demand warm temperatures and ample sunlight, while apples and pears flourish in cooler climates. Additionally, the soil type can greatly influence the health and productivity of the fruit trees. Well-drained, fertile soils are ideal as they provide the necessary nutrients and moisture retention without the risk of root diseases caused by excess water. Another critical factor is the proximity to markets. Being close to urban centers or areas with easy access to transportation can reduce costs and time involved in getting the produce to consumers, which is crucial for perishable items like fruit. Furthermore, the local infrastructure should support agricultural activities; this includes not only roads and transport but also access to water, potential for irrigation systems, and availability of agricultural services and supplies. For those new to the industry, it might also be wise to consider areas with established fruit-growing communities. Such regions often have better access to shared knowledge	1914	2005.9711
Souls communicate, but always imperfectly. They are always more or less at cross purposes and cross meanings. It is well to remember this when we feel inclined to deify society, the collective intelligence, the public conscience, the spirit of the age, and the like. Objectively reviewed, no doubt, society dwarfs the individual, such is the impressiveness of its sheer mass and momentum. Subjectively considered, however, society compares badly with the best individuals. The social mind is not merely hazy but even distraught, whether we look at it in its lowest manifestation, the mob, or in its highest, namely the state. At its best it is the mind of a public meeting, at its worst it is the mind of Babel.	Thus, the lofty ideals and aspirations that stir within the hearts of the finest men and women often find no echo in the collective consciousness. The moral and intellectual giants among us walk a solitary path, their thoughts and visions too grand or too subtle to be fully grasped by the aggregate. This disconnect not only highlights the inherent limitations within societal structures but also uncovers the profound isolation that can accompany true insight and moral courage. It is in this context that the individual's role within society becomes paradoxically significant yet marginalized. Those who push the boundaries of thought, who challenge the status quo, and who advocate for radical shifts in perspective or policy frequently find themselves at odds with the prevailing social currents. Their journey is one of constant struggle against the inertia of collective norms and values, which, though powerful, are often resistant to quick or profound change. This is why true progress, whether in the arts, sciences, or social reforms, often depends on the tenacity and vision of individuals who dare to think differently and who have the courage to stand alone. Society, for all its might and resources, tends to	1908	1996.3909
She was thinking of Coryston; and Coryston was giving her a good deal to think about. Of course she had expected annoyance, but scarcely such annoyance as Coryston, it seemed, was now bent on causing her. At bottom she had always reckoned on her position as mother and woman. Coryston might threaten, but that he should actually carry out such iniquities as he was now engaged on had been — she owned — beyond her calculations. For she had come down to find the whole neighbourhood in a ferment, and many pleasant illusions, in the shelter of which she had walked for years, both before and since her husband's death, questioned at least, and cracking, if not shattered.	The gossip was everywhere, and with it a kind of sullen hostility that she could almost touch, so thick was it in the air. People whom she had known for decades, upon whose loyalty and discretion she had unthinkingly counted, now looked at her askance, their greetings tinged with a reserve that was new, uncomfortable. She had always thought of Coryston as wild and impulsive, yes, but somehow within manageable bounds—her bounds. Yet here he was, rallying forces she hadn't imagined he could command, stirring up questions she had thought safely buried under the weight of tradition and the general acceptance of the status quo. The issue at heart was the land—their land. Coryston had begun to speak publicly about the rights of the tenant farmers, about the distribution of wealth and property, about reforms that cut to the very core of their familial legacy and threatened to redistribute not just land but power. He had thrown his support behind movements and ideas that were radical, unsettling for everyone who had vested interests in maintaining the current order. And he had done so with a	1913	1970.1061

Never was a fine and beautiful nature less conscious of itself, never a life more given to others. Probably it was not the sacrifice it seems to the world outside, for she was one of those who do not find self devotion a sacrifice.	Her existence was so interwoven with the lives and joys of those around her that their happiness became her own. Her letters, filled with wit and affection, reveal a spirit always ready to delight in the mundane and elevate the trivial.

Her keen eye for the nuances of social interaction and her sharp commentary on the pretensions and follies of her characters were drawn from the everyday interactions she witnessed from her corner of the world. Though her physical world might have been confined to a few English villages and towns, her mental landscape was vast and varied. She traversed the complexities of human emotions and societal norms with the agility of a seasoned traveler.

Air settles slowly and then tries to escape along the earth's surface. A balance of forces brings all parcels into a circulation pattern as illustrated in the lower sketch. The circular arrows are isobars and directions of the gradient wind in a high pressure, anticyclonic wind system. The inset at the left illustrates the direction of the surface wind, which is at 20° to the isobars and 70° to a line passing through the centre of the clockwise eddy. Isobars are separated by 10 millibars of pressure, with highest pressure at 1040, near the centre. Isobaric spacing and its relation to wind for given distances from the centre of the system are given in Table 8, page 128. PERMANENT ANTI cyclones. — anti cyclonic eddys or wind systems are either migratory or stationary.	Stationary anticyclones, often found over continents during winter months, can persist for several weeks, influencing weather patterns significantly by blocking or diverting the paths of storms and cyclones. These systems are characterized by clear skies, low humidity, and minimal precipitation, resulting in cold, frosty weather for extended periods. Migratory anticyclones, on the other hand, are more transient, typically moving across oceanic or continental regions and influencing weather conditions for a few days to a week. These systems move with the prevailing upper atmospheric winds and can lead to sudden changes in weather, including heat waves or cold spells, depending on the season and the origin of the anticyclone. Both types of anticyclonic systems play critical roles in the global circulation of air masses and the distribution of weather patterns. Their impact can be felt not just locally but also across vast distances as they interact with other atmospheric phenomena such as jet streams, ocean currents, and mountain ranges. Understanding these systems is crucial for accurate weather forecasting and for studying climate variability and change.	1913	2002.4078
21. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a cold storage plant? 22. How may inexpensive cooling rooms be fitted up? 23. Why are cooling rooms aboveground more satisfactory and economical than those in cellars? CHAPTER X. Our cultivated fruits, with a few unimportant exceptions, do not come true from seed, and hence, must be increased by division. The various ways in which seed enters into the subject of the propagation of fruits are as follows:  Propagation by Seed.	Seeds are primarily used in the breeding of new varieties and rootstocks. While this method is often slow and unpredictable, it is essential for the development of plants with desirable traits that are not present in existing varieties. Seed propagation also allows for the genetic diversity necessary for the health and adaptability of plant populations. Grafting and Budding. These techniques involve joining the tissue of one plant to the vascular system of another. Grafting is commonly used to propagate fruit trees because it allows growers to combine the best characteristics of two different plants, such as fruit quality from one and root hardiness from another. Layering. This method involves bending a branch to the ground and covering part of it with soil to encourage it to root. Once the new roots are established, the branch can be cut from the parent plant and transplanted. Layering is particularly useful for plants that do not root easily from cuttings. Cuttings. Taking cuttings is a straightforward method where a piece of the stem, leaf, or root is placed in a suitable medium to encourage root development. This method is	1914	2004.1735
It is at bottom a question of bringing to the study of fundamental questions the same qualities of detachment and intellectual self restraint that are universally demanded in the historian or the laboratory worker. The positive method is sometimes confounded with one which may be called the materialistic or mechanical. This method avoids the mystical and even obscurantist tendency of some forms of metaphysics by seeking to keep very close to experience and by insisting on very clear cut and well defined conceptions. But in so doing it is liable to certain special errors, and in particular does not, as I shall show, escape one of the most serious fallacies of 1. In the sciences the dialectical method lingers longest in connexion with the use of hypothesis.	The hypothesis, while a necessary tool for advancing knowledge, must be carefully managed to avoid becoming a mere projection of the researcher's preconceptions. In the dialectical method, hypotheses are not merely tested against observations but are also constantly refined and redefined through a process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. This iterative process ensures that each hypothesis is rigorously examined from multiple perspectives, reducing the risk of clinging to ideas that fit the data but do not truly explain it. However, the positive method, as championed by thinkers like Auguste Comte, emphasizes observation and empirical data as the primary sources of knowledge, eschewing the speculative for the concrete. This approach demands a strict adherence to data derived from controlled experiments and observable phenomena, thereby aiming to construct a reliable foundation of factual knowledge upon which further theories can be built. This method, while powerful, must be vigilant against the limitations of its own scope—namely, the risk of overlooking deeper, non-empirical dimensions of reality that cannot be directly observed or measured but are nonetheless significant. Thus, while the positive method seeks	1908	2006.8451
"In St. Gall only Weder and Baumgartner voted with the Democratic  412 and rural voters for a cantonal bank. The following passage in the St. Galler Zeitung, from the year 1863, gives a picture of the sentiments at this time: ""A cantonal bank — magic word! To some an evangel, to others a vexation, to some an unavoidable postulate of our social conditions, to others an unpractical project, a chimaera — a dark figure still, indistinct in its outlines, as to the man ashore the distant ship appearing at the horizon. It approaches — is it a corsair or a peaceful merchantman?"" More definite was the question in the same paper: ""The Loan Trust (Credit anstalt) has recently increased its rate of interest to eight percent and a cantonal bank is still deemed unnecessary ?"" Neuchatel showed an intention to proceed to a more independent railway policy."	Larger aspirations for autonomy in transportation were evident across the region, yet the controversy over the proposed cantonal bank in St. Gall highlighted the broader economic debates of the time. As the discussions and arguments grew more fervent, the local population began to divide sharply. Those in favor saw the bank as a necessary institution that would facilitate economic growth and stability, providing a much-needed counterbalance to the high interest rates that stifled local entrepreneurship and land development. Critics, however, feared it would introduce unnecessary risks and could potentially burden the canton with debt, especially if managed poorly. Amid these economic debates, Neuchatel's move towards an independent railway policy was seen as a strategic effort to enhance local control over transportation and reduce dependency on national and foreign railway interests. This initiative was regarded by many as a stepping stone towards greater economic sovereignty, potentially boosting trade and mobility within the canton and with neighboring regions. As the year progressed, the debates intensified, with public forums, newspaper editorials, and private meetings echoing the competing visions for the future of the region. The concept of a cantonal	1911	2000.5089
Arrhenius explained the apparent discrepancy in the case of electrolytes by means of the theory of electrolytic dissociation, which says that acids, bases and salts in aqueous solution are broken down into charged parts or ions. The question arises why is it so important to have shown that the laws of gas pressure apply to the osmotic pressure of solutions? We know more about matter in the gaseous state than in any other state of aggregation. We can deal with gases from the standpoint of the  only exact branch of science — mathematical physics — and Want Hoff showed that we can deal with solutions in the same manner. This raises the further question why is it so important to have a satisfactory theory as to the nature of solutions? A moment's thought will furnish the answer. The whole science of chemistry is a branch of the science of solutions.	Nearly every chemical reaction takes place within a solution, and the behavior of substances in this state is fundamental to understanding their properties and interactions. Furthermore, the principles governing solutions are critical not only in chemistry but also in biology, where the processes of life occur largely in aqueous environments, and in industry, where solutions are essential in everything from manufacturing processes to pharmaceuticals. The theory of electrolytic dissociation, by explaining how substances dissociate into ions in solution, has profound implications. It helps us understand phenomena such as conductivity, the mechanism of acid-base reactions, and the principles behind batteries and electroplating. Moreover, by applying the laws of gases to solutions through osmotic pressure, we gain quantitative tools to predict and manipulate the behavior of solutions in a way that was not possible before. This integration of knowledge allows for the precise control of chemical processes, enhancing efficiency and enabling new technologies. Thus, the significance of having a robust theoretical framework for solutions cannot be overstated. It is the bedrock upon which much of modern science and technology stands, enabling advances across a myriad of fields.	1911	1985.7336
"It is so awful for father with no women to look after him. But what should I find when I got here but that Aunt Harriet had left her favourite pension in Florence and arrived here the day before, with the sole reason that she felt father needed her. It's so perfectly silly. I was here. She only irritates father."" "" You weren't here when she got here."" ""No, but I was coming."" Barbara's anger was rising. "" Well, if you both arrived with the intention of preventing father from being lonely, why does he stay upstairs?"" ""I don't know; I think Aunt Harriet gets on his nerves. He has his collection of beetles all along the corridors, and she says the beetles moulder away into dust — some of them are getting ragged at the edges — and that we are all breathing beetles, and that vexes father."""	"""He's quite fond of his beetles,"" Barbara continued, with a touch of defensiveness in her voice. ""He says they remind him of his expeditions, and each one has a story. But Aunt Harriet, she just doesn't understand that. She thinks it's all just old dust and wants to throw them out. Can you imagine?"" Barbara's companion nodded sympathetically. ""It sounds like she doesn't quite grasp how important they are to him. Collections can be very personal, almost like parts of one's history."" ""Exactly!"" Barbara exclaimed, relieved to find understanding. ""And it's not just the beetles. She meddles in everything. She rearranged the library last week, and now father can’t find any of his books on entomology. It’s like she’s trying to erase the parts of him she doesn’t approve of."" The companion sighed. ""It must be tough dealing with that. Maybe it’s worth having a talk with your aunt, explaining how her actions affect your father. She might not realize the impact she’s having"	1913	1974.9762
"However much this inadequacy may have impressed my teacher, candour compels me to say that it did not bear too poignantly upon me. and I was willing to leave these as well as many other troublesome things to such all embracing causes as ""special physiological action"" or any other convenient bogie, as being entirely too mysterious for a beginner. Osmosis has indeed brought us far, and the briefest review will demonstrate the tremendous strides that have been made by its application. Our conceptions of turgidity and of processes which depend directly upon cell pressures are so well established as to be subject to but slight possible modification."	Moreover, the understanding of osmotic principles has fundamentally altered our approach to plant nutrition and the movement of fluids within the phloem and xylem. The elucidation of how water and nutrients are transported through these vascular systems has proven invaluable, revealing not only the pathways but also the mechanisms that drive such movements. This includes the role of osmotic gradients in directing the flow of substances from regions of higher concentration to those of lower concentration, thereby sustaining the life processes of plants. The practical applications of osmosis extend beyond botanical science. In the medical field, for instance, osmotic principles are crucial in the administration of intravenous fluids, the design of dialysis machines, and the development of drug delivery systems. Each of these utilizes osmotic pressure to achieve desired therapeutic effects, ensuring that substances move in and out of cells or across membranes in controlled ways. In industry, osmosis finds applications in the purification of water, the production of concentrated solutions, and even in the food sector for the dehydration and preservation of products. The ability to manipulate osmotic pressures enables	1911	2001.0748
With that surrender came the defection of such of the stronger nobility as had still supported his cause. And, what was worse, the chief of the western strongholds in turn abandoned the cause of John without a blow. The castle of Marlborough was handed over  1 Dr. Stubbs calls it Stonor, a small error but very irritating when it comes to indexing, particularly as nearly every other authority calls it Sandwich. to the rebellion and to the French prince, and Worcester did what Marlborough had done. London was against the Plantagenet with nearly all the chief nobles and all the invaders.	The situation was dire for John, as his remaining support crumbled beneath the weight of the overwhelming opposition. With London's gates closed firmly against him, and the loyalty of his once steadfast barons now turned to treachery, the king found himself increasingly isolated. The defections were not merely political but also strategic, as each castle that turned represented a loss of territorial control and a weakening of John's military position. The once mighty Plantagenet ruler seemed to shrink smaller with each passing day as the map of his kingdom was redrawn by his adversaries' victories. The French prince, bolstered by the support of the English nobles and the strategic strongholds now under his control, pressed his advantage. He moved with a confidence that seemed to proclaim him more king than the king himself. Each new allegiance to the prince was a nail in the coffin of John's reign, a stark symbol of his fading power and influence. Amidst this turmoil, the common folk of England watched and waited, their loyalties torn between a distant king who had failed to protect their interests, and a	1912	1907.6603
These meetings serve also as a good medium to spread reliable information in reference to young men of promise and to secure for them more prompt recognition than would otherwise be possible. One of the most hopeful signs as regards American mathematics is the fact that our students are in close contact with several of the mathematical centres of Europe. It is no longer true that nearly all Americans who go abroad for the purpose of studying mathematics locate in the same institution or in the same country. In recent years, Italy has grown rapidly in favour, while the leading universities of Germany and France continue to attract a considerable number of our best students.	This diversification of educational pursuits not only broadens the individual outlook of each student but also enriches the collective knowledge and methods back home as these students return. The exposure to various mathematical schools of thought, each with its unique strengths and areas of focus, fosters a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. Furthermore, the interaction between American students and their international peers and professors creates a dynamic exchange of ideas that propels forward both theoretical and applied mathematics. Moreover, the experiences gained from studying in different countries help cultivate a generation of mathematicians who are culturally aware and can approach problem-solving with a more global perspective. This is vital in a field where collaboration across borders is increasingly common and necessary for major advancements. As these young mathematicians return to the United States, they bring with them not only advanced knowledge and new techniques but also potential collaborative links with overseas institutions, further strengthening the international mathematical community.	1911	2003.6133
Consequently some latitude in the measurements of illumination must be allowed, higher results being naturally obtained in the case of a new installation. The figures for the consumption were necessarily to be regarded as approximate. They were calculated in terms of the area of platform lighted. It might, however, be argued that the lamps were also needed to light the rails, and in this case a breadth of about 18 ft., instead of 10 (the usual breadth of the platform), must be allowed, and the watts per square foot reduced accordingly. The central positions usually assigned to lamps in the tubes naturally meant that a very considerable amount of light fell on the rail bed.	This was an advantage in terms of providing safety and visibility for operational purposes, but it also meant that the efficiency of lighting directed solely at the platforms was somewhat diminished. The dispersion of light needed to be carefully calibrated to ensure that illumination was both adequate and economical. To optimize this, the placement and the intensity of the lamps had to be strategically managed. Further complicating the calculations was the fact that the reflectivity of the surfaces within the station played a significant role in how light was distributed. Darker colors absorbed more light, necessitating higher levels of illumination to achieve the same visual effect as would be needed in a lighter-colored environment. Consequently, the material finishes of the platform surfaces, rails, and even the trains themselves could impact the overall lighting requirements. To address these challenges, it was proposed to conduct a series of tests. These would measure actual light levels across different areas of the platform and tracks under various conditions. The results would help in refining the models used to predict lighting needs, allowing for more precise adjustments to lamp placement and output. This approach promised not only to enhance safety and visibility but	1912	1994.0845
The author gives a series of diagrams showing the distribution curves of reflectors suitable for narrow and deep windows respectively. Several photometric articles deserve mention. J. S. Dow (Elec. World, Oct. 26) deals with the possibilities of Physical Photometers, pointing out that although of possible use for comparative measurements, they are not readily applicable to absolute testing of light. H. KRUSS describes a somewhat complicated form of mirror arrangement for obtaining the polar curves of very large sources (J.J.O.. Nov. 23). Hyde and Cady describe a form of precision bench for photometry (Elec. Rev., NY., Nov. 16). ELECTRIC LIGHTING.	The development of electric lighting continues to be a subject of great interest and importance. The advances in this field are marked by the introduction of more efficient light sources, such as LED bulbs, which not only consume less energy but also have a longer lifespan compared to traditional incandescent and fluorescent bulbs. This shift is significant in reducing the overall energy consumption and environmental impact of lighting systems. In addition to efficiency improvements, there has been a considerable focus on the aesthetic and functional aspects of lighting. The ability to control the intensity and color of light through dimmable LEDs and smart lighting systems has transformed the way spaces are illuminated. These technologies allow for customization of lighting to suit different times of the day, activities, or moods, enhancing both the utility and ambiance of lit environments. Furthermore, the integration of lighting with other building systems through smart grids and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies is paving the way for more responsive and adaptive lighting solutions. These systems can adjust lighting based on occupancy or natural light availability, leading to further efficiencies and improvements in comfort. The ongoing research and development in photometry and light	1912	2005.5062
The greater portion of the volume is concerned with this struggle between the call of ambition and his sense of love and duty. The atmosphere of the book is very fine and no one can read it without being made better for its perusal. The Path of Glory. By Paul Leland Haworth. Illustrated. Cloth. Pp. 3.48.	"Price $1.50. New York: Harper & Brothers. The narrative sweeps across the life of Thomas Eldridge, a man torn between the relentless pursuit of a political career and the quiet beckoning of familial affection and contentment in a small town. Haworth skillfully depicts Thomas's internal conflicts and the repercussions they have on those he holds dear. The vivid descriptions of the rural landscapes juxtapose the tumultuous world of political intrigue, providing a rich backdrop that enhances the thematic depth of the novel. Throughout the book, readers are invited to reflect on the true cost of ambition and the value of simplicity and integrity. The illustrations accompanying the text further draw the reader into the era and setting, making the dilemmas and emotions of the characters even more palpable. ""The Path of Glory"" is not merely a story about choices; it is a poignant exploration of life's fleeting nature and the enduring impact of the paths we choose."	1911	2004.3901
The popular fury over Civil War issues having subsided, public opinion was no longer deeply interested in leaders of the Civil War period, not even in its greatest military hero. For that reason alone Grant's defeat was inevitable, even though enough of the old sentiment survived to bring a minor figure of the Civil War to the front. The true explanation of this reaching out for new leadership was the popular unrest which vaguely demanded new issues and which in the ensuing campaign settled upon the tariff question. Of course there was at that time no intelligent apprehension among the politicians in either party of an impending change. Though politicians often sense political changes, much as rheumatic victims sense changes in the weather, they are usually deficient in the gift of rational political prophecy.	This deficiency was particularly marked in the period following the Civil War, where the rapid pace of industrialization and the complexities of integrating a post-war economy left many traditional political figures out of step with the needs and sentiments of the populace. The emerging issues were not merely of economic policy but also of social structure, labor rights, and the role of government in regulating the burgeoning industries that were transforming the American landscape. As the tariff became a central theme, it was clear that the public was grappling with broader questions about fairness, protectionism, and the distribution of wealth. The debates and decisions of this period would set the stage for the progressive era, as calls for reform grew louder and the limitations of old political paradigms became increasingly apparent. The shift toward new leadership was not just a rejection of Civil War heroes but a natural progression towards addressing the needs of a changing nation, demonstrating once again the dynamic and responsive nature of American democracy.	1911	1995.3546
1). The essential parts are : — A. The container for the gas. This is made from a wide mouthed and fairly thick walled round bottle (sample bottle) : the bottom is cut off and the sides ground first on a carborundum wheel, and then with powder on a flat glass plate, so as to produce a ring on a plane at right angles to the length of the bottle. This flat ring is the surface to which the fabric to be tested is stuck with a warm 10 percent, solution of gelatine and glycerine in water; the setting of the jelly pulls the fabric taut across the circular opening. The mouth of the bottle is closed by a rubber bung, which is covered to a thickness of about J inch with a strong jelly (50 grins, gelatine in from drying up). Inside the bottle is placed: B.	The gas source, which is typically a small, controlled flame or a chemically reactive substance that generates a specific type of gas. This source must be stable and consistent to ensure accurate testing conditions. The type of gas used can vary depending on the specific requirements of the experiment or the properties of the fabric being tested. C. A pressure gauge or sensor connected to the rubber bung. This instrument measures the pressure inside the container to monitor the integrity of the fabric under test. Any change in pressure can indicate a leak or failure in the fabric's structure, making this component critical for assessing the material's durability and resistance to gas permeation. D. A mechanism for introducing and regulating the flow of gas into the container. This could be a simple valve system connected to a gas cylinder or a more sophisticated setup involving pumps and automated controls. The ability to precisely control the gas flow is essential for maintaining consistent test conditions and ensuring the reliability of the results. E. Safety features are also integral to the design of the apparatus. These may include pressure relief valves to prevent over-pressurization, flame arrest	1912	1999.328
Itccl Face. Galley Bench. Ft. candles | Ft. candles Ft. candles 2-75 3'9 , 6-0 to the compositor; the bench length per man averaged from 5 ft. 6 in. 'to 6 ft. 1J in., arid, when glow lamps were used, one lamp per man was usually the allowance, although in some few cases two lamps per man wore provided, and in one case the lamps were spaced at regular 3 ft. intervals. The following are typical results. The daylight measurements were made  at 10 A.M.. on a February morning when no sunlight was available. In the composing room many other operations besides typesetting are conducted, such as the assembly of advertisements and miscellaneous matter. This is done on horizontal tables called random benches.	The random benches, usually positioned centrally in the composing room, receive more uniform lighting, beneficial for the meticulous work of organizing layout and proofing. The light measurements on these benches showed an average of 5.5 ft. candles, slightly less than at the galley benches but sufficient for the tasks performed there. Furthermore, distribution of light is crucial in the composing room to avoid shadows and glare, which could hinder the accuracy of typesetting and layout assembly. Therefore, the placement of glow lamps is carefully considered to ensure an even spread of light, avoiding areas of excessive brightness or darkness which can lead to eye strain and errors in work. To enhance visual clarity, some composing rooms also employ task lighting at individual workstations, particularly where fine details are handled. These additional light sources are adjustable, allowing workers to tailor the lighting to specific tasks and personal comfort, thereby optimizing productivity and reducing fatigue. Overall, the lighting strategy in a composing room is designed to support a range of visual tasks by providing adequate, evenly distributed illumination, while also considering the comfort and efficiency of the compositor and other staff involved	1912	1974.5697
The young are born in a very immature state, and are transferred by the mother, who uses her lips for the purpose. to the pouch, where she attaches the little embryo to the nipple. So closely does the tiny creature adhere to the teat that bushmen for generations have been persuaded that it originates there. It remains in the pouch for months, and even when able to leave the pouch anil browze on the grass, will, if alarmed, at once take refuge in the familiar shelter. The females are in general much smaller than the males, and are less aggressive. The Kangaroos and Wallabies are growing scarcer rapidly. Besides the hunters who pursue them for their skins, the squatter and the farmer have been allies in warfare against these nomad rangers. Both have considered that their interest demand the extermination of these aboriginal possessors of the land.	The encroachment of agricultural development has further reduced their natural habitats, leading to a significant decline in their populations. This is compounded by the fact that kangaroos and wallabies are often seen as competitors for grazing land needed for livestock. Additionally, the introduction of non-native predators and competitors, such as foxes and rabbits, has exacerbated the struggle for survival among these native species. Efforts to protect and conserve kangaroos and wallabies have been implemented, but the challenges are substantial. Protected areas and wildlife reserves have been established, providing sanctuaries where these animals can live with reduced human interference. However, the vast areas over which they roam make it difficult to effectively manage their protection. Conservation programs also focus on public education to change perceptions and reduce the demand for products derived from these animals. As the balance between agricultural interests and wildlife conservation continues to be a contentious issue, the future of kangaroos and wallabies hangs in a delicate balance. There is a pressing need for more comprehensive strategies that can accommodate the needs of both the farming communities and the wildlife that are intrinsic to the Australian	1909	2006.9215
It was 9 p.m.. before the Lion and Selkirk had closed on the remnant of the German squadron which had raided the South Wales ports sufficiently to engage it. The five German ships had passed through the dangerous passage between the Smalls and the mainland without misadventure, and were slightly to the northwest of St. David's Head. Right ahead of them were the British destroyers, ready to cooperate in the attack as soon as the big cruisers came up; abreast of the German line were the two large British armoured cruisers ; well astern of them was the Terrific, heading to cut off their retreat. The German ships were formed up with the Cormoran at the head, and astern of her in line the Sperber, Schwalbe, Meteor, and Falke. None of these poor old vessels mounted anything larger than a 4 inch gun, and none of them could steam more than twelve knots. The only course remaining for them was to make some show of fight for the honour of the German flag, and to their credit be it said that they did this.	As the British forces closed in, the sea was rough and the wind whipped fiercely, making navigation difficult but not deterring the resolve of either side. The Lion, leading the British cruisers, opened fire at a range of about 10,000 yards. The German vessels, outgunned and slower, returned fire sporadically, their shells falling short in the churning sea. The Selkirk flanked the Lion, laying down a heavy barrage that splintered the deck of the Cormoran, causing visible damage and chaos among its crew. The destroyers, nimble and fast, darted forward, launching torpedoes. The Germans, aware of their disadvantage, maneuvered desperately to avoid the deadly projectiles. The Sperber took a hit on her starboard side, resulting in an explosion that slowed her considerably. Her crew fought to maintain control and keep her afloat, but she lagged behind. Meanwhile, the Terrific, steaming at full speed from the rear, aimed to intercept the Meteor and Falke, preventing any possibility of escape. The British cruis	1906	1953.8676
"The legal value might be five dollars and the intrinsic value one cent, for the legal value need not correspond at all with the intrinsic value, for intrinsic value is not acknowledged by the Constitution or Courts as an element of money."" 347 The United States statutes in regard to the greenbacks provide that ""these notes shall be legal tender and lawful money."" So by that decision we have two kinds of money in this country — United States notes and coin. When we think of the number of people whom the bankers have hypnotised into the belief that money should have some element of intrinsic value, it is enough to make one despair for the future of our country. The bankers want intrinsic value and redemption money."	But what they fail to remember, or choose to ignore, is that money is fundamentally a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value as defined by law, not by the material from which it is made. The true utility of money in an economy is not derived from the metal or paper it is printed on, but from its ability to facilitate transactions and economic activities. The insistence on intrinsic value is a relic of past economic theories that do not necessarily apply to modern financial systems. Intrinsic value is not necessary for money to function effectively; what is necessary is trust and stability in the currency issued by a government. This trust is established through the legal backing of the currency as legitimate and acceptable for all debts, public and private. Furthermore, the concept of intrinsic value in money can lead to unnecessary complications and economic inefficiencies. For instance, if the value of the metal in coins were to exceed their face value, it could lead to hoarding or melting down of coins, thus disrupting the monetary system. The separation of legal tender from intrinsic value allows for more flexibility and adapt	1911	1984.8617
Intellectually, it is commonly accepted that, in a thousand ways, the family home cannot compete with the civic hospital or school; but in feeling, this position is not always accepted quite frankly. There is a remnant of conviction that civic assistance is a last resort and a proof of family failure. Yet even this is passing away and we find in some cities that every class of the community, rich and poor, not merely admit the usefulness of their public institutions, but imperiously demand their use. In Glasgow, for example, it is now not uncommon for the Medical Officer of Health to remove to hospital from 90 to 100 percent, of persons suffering from certain infectious diseases. This is done without compulsion. It is merely the municipal organisation acting in response to the wish of individual citizens. Infectious disease has always been a great educator and has taught civilisation many intimate truths.	It has forced upon society the recognition of the necessity for collective action in matters of public health, the establishment of stringent sanitation laws, and the need for medical research and education. This shift in perception has been gradual but profound, as the health of the community has come to be seen not just as a private matter but a public responsibility. This understanding has led to a significant increase in trust and reliance on public health systems.  Moreover, the acceptance of civic institutions extends beyond the realm of health. Educational systems, too, have seen a transformation in their role within society. Schools are no longer viewed merely as places for academic learning but as vital community centers that offer a range of services and support to families. They provide not only education but also nutrition, psychological counseling, and sometimes even legal assistance, recognizing the complex needs of modern families. This broadened role of public institutions reflects a deeper societal change. As communities become more complex and interconnected, the traditional roles of family and individual solutions are often inadequate to address broader social challenges. The reliance on civic institutions is not just a matter of practicality but a	1908	1983.1771

There is a dogged insistence about subways such as are being driven today beneath New York. A surface line is pliant, amenable, and full of easy sinuosities. But a subway is more inflexible. It goes through and not around; and since New York underground railways are near the surface, they bisect a thousand buried and often forgotten things. They drive straight on with steel shod indifference. What man has built man can rebuild. That is an axiom to the engineer. He pierces substructures, hotel kitchens, and the press rooms of great printing offices in order to hurl his burdened trains, his humanly charged projectiles, through the dismembered and repatched bowels of a metropolis.	The excavation for these subterranean passages reveals layers of the city's past—old sewer lines, the foundations of razed buildings, and occasionally even more ancient and unexpected relics. Each layer tells a story, a narrative of generations and the ever-changing face of urban life. It is a testament to the city's relentless evolution, its perpetual motion forward, regardless of the remnants of its history that lie buried beneath. Yet, despite the disruption and the chaos that often accompany such monumental undertakings, there is a certain order and precision in the way these tunnels are carved through the earth. The engineers and workers follow meticulously planned routes, guided by maps and blueprints that consider not only the physical but also the historical and cultural obstacles. The subway, with its unyielding path, imposes a new order on the chaotic underbelly of the city, transforming what was once hidden and unused into arteries of vibrant, bustling activity. As trains thunder through these newly forged underground corridors, they connect disparate parts of the city in ways that surface transport cannot. They shrink the vast distances of the metropolis,	1913	2007.089
The Foire St. Laurent followed, from June 27th till the end of September. It was held between the Faubourg St. Denis and the Faubourg St. Martin, at about where is now the southern end of the Grands Boulevards. See Maurice Albert, Les Thl&tre* de la foire (Paris, 1904). inferior brethren at the Fair. Their prayer was heard: Monnet's privilege was taken from him, and the opera Comique closed its doors. Monnet did not long remain unoccupied.	He soon found another venue for his talents, this time focusing on the production of lighter, more popular forms of entertainment which were not subject to the same stringent regulations as the opera comique. He ventured into the world of vaudeville and the pantomime, genres that were immensely popular among the common folk of Paris. These performances often took place in makeshift theaters at the fairs themselves, drawing large crowds eager for amusement and escape from the drudgery of daily life. Monnet's adaptability and keen sense of audience taste made him a significant figure in the evolution of popular entertainment during this period. His productions, though less prestigious than the grand operas, were vital in shaping the cultural landscape of Paris. They provided a platform for new talents to emerge and for innovative storytelling techniques to be tested, contributing to the vibrant and dynamic nature of Parisian culture. As the Foire St. Laurent continued to thrive, it became a crucible for artistic experimentation, blending traditional forms with emerging trends. This fair, along with others like it, played a crucial role in democratizing entertainment,	1912	1938.6974
With its greater resources it can organise and maintain a single well equipped laboratory and secure the services of the very best men, and at a much smaller figure than would be needed to maintain a number of separate institutions. An instance is afforded by the laboratory of the General Electric Co. at Schenectady, where valuable researches on electric lamps are being constantly carried out under the supervision of Dr. Whitney. The United Gas Improvement Co. of Philadelphia have recently appointed Dr. H. E. Ives to undertake the supervision of their research laboratory. There can be no question of the soundness of the policy of encouraging such researches. But the degree of usefulness of such laboratories depends on there being a clear and definite idea as to the aims and objects to be pursued, and a recognition of what can be done with the means available.	Moreover, the successful operation of these corporate research laboratories hinges on the integration of their objectives with the broader strategic goals of the company. It is not enough to simply conduct research for its own sake; the work must align with and potentially enhance the company's products, processes, or services. This requires not only skilled scientists and engineers but also effective communication and collaboration between the research teams and other departments within the company, such as product development, marketing, and executive management. In addition to aligning with corporate objectives, these laboratories must also foster an environment that encourages creativity and innovation. This involves providing researchers with the resources and freedom to explore new ideas, while also establishing a framework that helps guide these explorations towards practical and actionable outcomes. The balance between open-ended exploration and goal-directed research is delicate and requires careful management to maintain. Furthermore, the impact of such research facilities extends beyond the immediate commercial benefits. They can serve as centers of excellence that contribute to the advancement of science and technology more broadly. Through publications, conferences, and collaborations with academic institutions, the work done in these corporate labs can influence and	1912	2003.1914

In this compelling biography, Frank Hamel delves into the life and works of Jean de la Fontaine, one of France's most revered poets. Known for his fables, which have been cherished by readers of all ages, de la Fontaine's wit and insight into human nature are brilliantly captured in these short, moralistic stories. However, Hamel's biography goes beyond the fables to explore the complexities of de la Fontaine's personal life, his relationships, and the political turmoil of his times. Through meticulous research, Hamel portrays a man who was deeply entwined with the literary and social circles of the Sun King's court yet who was also a figure of paradoxes—a royalist who flirted with subversion, a playful mind with a penchant for melancholy. The biography is enriched with excerpts from de la Fontaine's diverse body of work, including his lesser-known but equally poignant poems and plays, providing a comprehensive picture of a man whose legacy has become synonymous with French literature itself.

The ex mayor of New York appears to place himself among those who view taxes as necessarily drafts upon the private property of citizens. If taxes are high per capita, or per thousand dollars of property assessed, therefore municipalities are extravagant and their citizens are in danger of impoverishment. This is the all too familiiar burden of lamentation.	Yet, this perspective fails to account for the complexities of municipal finance and the varied benefits derived from public expenditures. Taxes, when judiciously levied and efficiently utilized, are not merely deductions from private wealth but investments in the collective welfare. They fund the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, support public education, ensure safety through police and fire services, and provide for the health and well-being of the community through sanitation and public health programs. It is essential to recognize that the quality of these services directly influences the quality of life and the economic vitality of a city. A well-educated populace, reliable infrastructure, and effective public safety measures are foundational to attracting businesses and residents whose activities contribute to the city's economic growth. Thus, rather than viewing taxes as a financial burden, they should be seen as essential contributions to sustaining and enhancing the communal assets that underpin prosperity. Moreover, the argument that high taxes inevitably lead to economic decline omits consideration of the role of fiscal governance. It is not the rate of taxation alone that determines the economic health of a city, but how those funds are managed. Transparency,	1911	1972.4185

For example, in the case given in Art. 80, of a non central load W on a simply supported beam, using the notation of Art. 80 and Fig. 116, taking each end as origin in turn, and integrating over the whole span, using (7) — Jo Jo WW hence — yc = — r — r i\i t rt + b)Kl which agrees with (8), Art.	80, where yc represents the maximum deflection at the center of the beam. This method of calculating deflections via resilience offers a distinct advantage in terms of understanding the energy transformations involved in beam bending and can be particularly useful in complex loading scenarios. Additionally, for beams with different boundary conditions or geometries, similar approaches can be adopted. For instance, a cantilever beam carrying a uniform distributed load w can have its resilience calculated from the bending moment equation \( M(x) = \frac{w}{2} (L^2 - x^2) \), where L is the length of the beam and x is a variable along the length from the fixed end. Integrating this bending moment to find the strain energy and subsequently the resilience provides a pathway to calculating the maximum deflection at the free end of the beam. Thus, by employing the resilience method, engineers can assess the flexibility and energy absorption characteristics of beams under various loads, which is crucial for designing structures that are both efficient and safe. This approach effectively links the concepts of mechanical energy with structural behavior, enhancing the analytical capabilities in	1908	1999.5592
"That this much heralded (and advertised) product is not gaining ground is clear to all who read current medical journals. The recent effort of the health board officials to force its use on the profession brought out a letter from Dr. Willard Watson of Philadelphia, that was published in the March number of Medical Notes and Queries — both journal and writer are 'regular.' Here is a quotation from it: "" 'We all admit that anti toxin in the laboratory is practically a sure cure for diphtheria."	"However, in the practical application to the cases we encounter in daily practice, there are numerous variables that significantly affect its efficacy. The stage of the disease at which the treatment is administered, the patient's overall health, and other concurrent infections or conditions play a crucial role. It is erroneous to assume that what works in controlled, clinical settings will invariably produce the same results in the more complex and unpredictable environment of general medical practice.' Dr. Watson's candid critique continues to stir discussion, especially among those who have observed discrepancies between clinical trial results and real-world outcomes. He further argues that the push for widespread adoption of antitoxin treatment overlooks these nuances, potentially leading to overreliance on a therapy that may not be as universally effective as advertised. His concerns resonate with a growing faction within the medical community who advocate for a more measured and patient-specific approach to the use of antitoxin in treating diphtheria."""	1911	2003.8951
Positive angles of yaw and positive forces are related to the wind direction as shown in Fig. 23. Fig. 23. The results are plotted in the curves of Fig. 24 (opposite). These show no striking peculiarities. The lack of symmetry is, of course, due to the lack of symmetry in the model, and the negative value of the longitudinal force at certain angles is now a fairly well understood phenomenon, as will be realised from the study of the results given elsewhere in this volume and in that for the year 1911-12. The drift in the ordinary position which the wheels would assume in normal horizontal flight is equivalent to about 2-4 lbs. per wheel upon a full sized wheel moving at 70 miles per hour.	This drift, while seemingly minor, has significant implications for the stability and control of the aircraft during flight. It is particularly noticeable during maneuvers that involve sharp turns or sudden changes in altitude, where the asymmetric forces can cause unexpected shifts in trajectory. To counteract these effects, engineers have developed various methods of adjusting the alignment and configuration of the wheels and control surfaces to better distribute the forces and maintain balance. Further analysis of the data reveals that the distribution of yaw forces varies with the speed of the aircraft, as well as the angle of attack. At higher speeds, the forces become more pronounced, necessitating more precise adjustments to the aircraft's control systems. This is consistent with theoretical predictions and aligns with observed flight behavior in similar models. The study of these aerodynamic phenomena is crucial for the advancement of aircraft design, especially as we push the boundaries of speed and maneuverability. The insights gained from these experiments not only improve safety but also enhance the efficiency and performance of future aircraft models. As we continue to refine our understanding of these dynamics, we can expect to see even more sophisticated designs emerging in the	1912	1997.1539
28 (c). This appendage was rounded off on the foot and fined down. This gave rather better results than (A), but still had the same disadvantages. 28 (d). In the place of the appendage a brass fin of much the same contour as that of (b) but deeper, was fitted along the centre line at the bow, the angles between the fin and the bottom of the float being filled in and rounded off. This was less successful than (c). 28 (e). A piece of thin tin 3 | inches wic'e was screwed to the nose of the float so as to project forwards 1 : J inches in the direction of the under surface of the float at the nose. This was quite successful in beating down the bow wave and preventing it breaking on the float, but threw the water rather far ahead.	28 (f). A modification of the previous design was tried by reducing the length of the tin projection to just under an inch, while slightly increasing its width. This adjustment maintained the wave suppression benefits while minimizing the excessive splash forward, resulting in a more controlled and efficient water displacement. 28 (g). Next, an approach using a flexible material was tested. A strip of rubber was attached in a similar manner to the tin in design (e), but allowed for a degree of give that adapted to varying speeds and pressures. This proved to be effective at medium speeds, although at higher velocities, the flexibility of the rubber caused it to flutter, somewhat reducing its efficacy. 28 (h). To counteract the fluttering seen in the previous experiment, a stiffer polymer was substituted for the rubber. This material provided the necessary rigidity to withstand higher speeds without significant vibration, maintaining consistent performance across a broader range of conditions.	1912	1982.3035
"Kig. 237. — Portland cement. {From Goodman's ""Mechanics applied to Engineering."") A single lever testing machine, made by Mr. Adie, with a regulated travelling poise D is shown in Fig. 238. The briquette is placed in the clips B.C., and the hand wheel R serves to tighten the screw attached to the lower clip C, so as to raise the lever F into a position of balance between the stops on the standard E. The poise D may be moved along the lever F by means of the handle at the end of the beam. For loading at a uniform rate the traverse of the poise is accomplished by the pull of a suspended weight W, regulated by a dashpot cylinder below the pulley 5; the rate of traverse is regulated by adjusting a cock in the piston of the dashpot. Fig."	239 illustrates a similar testing apparatus but includes a dial gauge G which provides a direct reading of the displacement or strain in the material being tested. This gauge is mounted on the frame A, directly opposite the lever arm F, and connects to the upper clip B via a small, flexible cable. As the material within the clips B and C stretches or compresses under the applied load, the movement is transmitted through the cable to the dial gauge G, allowing for precise measurement of the deformation. The operation of this machine begins with the placement of the briquette or other test specimen within the grips B and C. The operator then uses the hand wheel R to adjust the initial tension, ensuring that the lever F is balanced and ready for testing. Once the specimen is properly secured and the system is balanced, the weight W is released gradually, causing the poise D to traverse along the lever F at a controlled rate due to the resistance provided by the dashpot. As the load increases, the specimen material undergoes stress, and any resulting strain is immediately recorded by the dial gauge G. This setup not only	1908	1944.5709
From time to time there is great talk of abolishing the custom in the newspapers; the editors write against it, and their readers write to them and thank them; but hitherto nothing has been done except in that one hotel, which we are so resolutely keeping secret. There is no reason, however, no scruple that need oblige us to secrecy concerning the means by which this inspired hostelry has freed its guests and servants from their common curse. The management has imagined paying the employees a sufficient wage, and the device has worked perfectly. Where the other hotels pay a man thirty dollars a month, this hotel pays him sixty dollars a month. It may seem incredible, but this has ended tipping there.	The employees, being fairly compensated, no longer look to the whims of generous patrons to supplement an inadequate income. This model, revolutionary as it may appear, has not only increased the satisfaction of the staff but also enhanced the overall guest experience. Patrons now enjoy a more genuine service, free from the underlying expectation of a tip for every interaction, which often marred the simplicity of their stay. The success of this system has sparked discussions among other hoteliers, yet many are hesitant to adopt such a practice, fearing the initial financial outlay. However, the enlightened proprietor of our undisclosed hotel maintains that this increased expenditure is offset by the rise in repeat customers and the positive reviews that spread more swiftly than the seasonal winds. Indeed, the establishment has noted a marked improvement in employee retention rates, reducing the costs associated with training new staff and the inefficiencies of a continually rotating workforce.	1913	1971.9486
The Ware rules prescribe — if there is no majority of first choices — the dropping out of the candidate lowest on the poll and the distribution of Ms ballots only according to the second or the next highest available preference marked on them, then the dropping of the next lowest candidate in the same way, and so on until one candidate has a majority of the votes behind him. The Bucklin rules, on the other hand, prescribe — if there is no majority of first choices — the adding together of the first choice and the second choice votes for each candidate to see whether any candidate has a majority, counting both; next, if no candidate has such a majority, it prescribes the adding together of the first choice, second choice, and third choice votes for each candidate to see whether any candidate has a majority, counting the three grades of votes together; and so on until some candidate has behind him a majority, counting all the grades of votes thus far taken into account, when that candidate is declared elected. THE NANSON SYSTEM.	The Nanson system, developed by the Australian mathematician Edward J. Nanson, takes a different approach from both the Ware and Bucklin rules. Under this system, after each round of counting, instead of merely eliminating the candidate with the fewest votes, the average score of all the remaining candidates is calculated. Any candidate whose score falls below this average is eliminated. This process continues, recalculating the average and eliminating candidates who fall below it, until a single candidate remains or a candidate achieves a majority of the votes. Nanson's method is designed to ensure that the winner has broad support among the electorate, rather than just a simple plurality. It also helps mitigate the impact of tactical voting, where voters might otherwise be encouraged to rank less-preferred candidates higher to avoid wasting their vote on a likely loser. The system attempts to find a candidate who is a compromise choice acceptable to the widest portion of the community. Like the Bucklin system, Nanson's method can require multiple rounds of counting as votes are redistributed from eliminated candidates. However, the requirement for a candidate to exceed the average	1914	1977.7509
"It is a characteristic merit of the ""scientific method"" and the ""spiral plan, "" and is generally recognised as the natural order of mental growth. Thus most of the knowledge acquired in school is but transient in its value — a scaffolding for the erection of a more perfect structure It is not the agricultural work considered as knowledge so much as the right kind of training in science which its inclusion alone insures that makes it the best means of preparation in science for any collegiate course or for any general educational purpose. But the fundamental sciences can not be depended upon to give a complete treatment of the subject of agriculture as it should be treated in the high school Where manual skills in technical processes are ■ "" In order to develop a subject well, ... it is necessary to establish and maintain a favourable atmosphere for that particular field of mental activity, and this atmosphere is at its best only in the presence of students interested mainly in that subject; that is to say, there is no more favourable place in which the farmer may study chemistry than in company with others, not merely of his own kind, but of those who believe that chemistry is the greatest thing on earth.'' — Davenport, ""Education for Efficiency, "" p. 103. ""Learning a business really implies learning the science involved in it."	Therefore, it is essential that educational institutions not only teach the technical skills required for a particular profession but also deepen the understanding of the underlying scientific principles. This dual focus will equip students not only to perform specific tasks but also to innovate and adapt to changes within their field. For the farmer, this means understanding the science of soil, plant biology, meteorology, and more, which are crucial for making informed decisions that impact crop yields and farm sustainability. Moreover, integrating science into vocational training helps bridge the gap between theory and practice. It allows students to see the practical applications of scientific concepts, making their learning experience more relevant and engaging. This approach fosters a deeper appreciation of science as not just an academic subject but as a vital tool that drives the industry forward. Educators must therefore strive to create a curriculum that balances both practical skills training and scientific education, ensuring that students are not only competent technicians but also thoughtful practitioners who can contribute to their fields in meaningful ways. This holistic approach to education is what will truly prepare students for the complexities of modern professions, allowing them to thrive in an ever-ev	1911	2006.7281
"in a solid circular section of radius R, d = 2R, k = ~, and c = 16a. "" Rational"" derivations of Rankine's and Gordon's formulae have often been given, but they depend on the inexact assumptions that since the deflection of a beam under purely transverse loads is directly proportional to the square of the length within the elastic limit, the same is true of deflections resulting from end loads and beyond the elastic limit.

(4) The Liver. Drechsel described a substance containing nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur which he obtained from the liver of the horse and porpoise, and called jecorine. He obtained it by extracting the minced organ with alcohol, evaporating the alcohol at 40° to 50° C., treating the residue with absolute alcohol and what would not dissolve in this with aether. The ethereal solution was precipitated many times with absolute alcohol, and the precipitate dried to a light, porous, yellow powder that was intensely hygroscopic. The dry substance was insoluble in dry aether but dissolved in aether when wet; it dissolved in water slowly, at first swelling up to a slimy mass but finally giving a clear solution.	Drechsel's analysis of jecorine revealed it to contain 51.5% carbon, 7.0% hydrogen, 15.5% nitrogen, 1.2% phosphorus, and 1.3% sulphur. The ratios of these elements, particularly the presence of both phosphorus and sulphur, suggested that jecorine might play a significant role in the metabolic processes of the liver, though its exact function was not yet understood. Further research into its biochemical pathways was necessary to elucidate its role. Continuing his experiments, Drechsel attempted to understand the physiological implications of jecorine. He hypothesized that it might be involved in detoxification processes or perhaps in the synthesis of other vital compounds within the liver. Subsequent experiments involved observing the effects of administering jecorine to laboratory animals and monitoring changes in their liver function and overall health. Other researchers of the time were prompted by Drechsel's findings to explore similar compounds in different organs, broadening the scope of biochemical study and contributing to the early understanding of organ-specific biochemistry	1913	2006.0765
"The paper was a Radical paper, and it had blossomed into its biggest head lines for the Chancellor: ""Chancellor goes for the Landlords"" — ""Crushing attack"" — ""Tories writhe under it"" — ""Frantic applause!"" She put it down, half contemptuous, half pleased. She had grown accustomed to the mouldings of party politics, and could not do without them. But her brain was not taken in by them. "" Father was not so good as usual last night, "" she said to herself. ""But nobody else would have been half so good!"" she added, with a fierce protectiveness. And in that spirit she rose to meet the stately lady in black whom the Ather stones' maidservant was showing across the garden. ""Miss Glenwilliam, I believe?"" Lady Coryston paused and put up her eyeglass. Enid Glenwilliam advanced, holding out her hand. ""How do you do, Lady Coryston?"" The tone was gay, even amused."	"Lady Coryston took the proffered hand with a certain reserve, her sharp gaze assessing the younger woman before her. Enid's reputation as a formidable political thinker and activist preceded her, and Lady Coryston was not one to be easily swayed or impressed. ""Miss Glenwilliam, welcome,"" she said, her voice carrying a mix of politeness and caution. ""I understand you've been quite involved with the new reform movements."" ""Yes, indeed,"" Enid replied, her eyes sparkling with an irrepressible enthusiasm. ""There's so much to be done, so much potential for change. It's an exciting time, don't you think?"" Lady Coryston's lips tightened slightly. ""Exciting—yes, perhaps for some. Disruptive for others,"" she remarked dryly. She led Enid through the hall into a sunlit drawing room, gesturing for her to take a seat. ""Tea will be served shortly. You must tell me more about your work with the tenants' rights campaign.

The effect was small: the parallel position was apparently the best. IThe planes were next staggered, the line joining corresponding points making an angle of + 33° 45' with the vertical ; and in each position the upper plane was rotated through ± 23. The lift maximum was greatest (0'55 nearly) when the upper plane was forward of the lower, and its angle of attack 2° less than that of the lower. The maximum lift/drift in this case was, however, very little, if at all, greater than for the two parallel planes unstaggered. With the lower plane forward of thejipper the maximum lift/drift occurred when the upper plane was inclined at the greater angle, this maximum having again practically the same value as before. The maximum lift coefficient was, however, only 0-46. A comparison of the three best cases: (1) the two surfaces parallel and vertically above one another; (2) the upper surface forward and at a smaller angle of attack ; and (3) the lower surface forward and at a smaller angle of attack shows that for the same drift they give, within the limits of accuracy of the experiments, the same lift over the ordinary working range, but the maximum lift is given by (2), and the least by (3). (2) thus gives an advantage in getting off the ground, or in flattening out after a descent.	The experiments further revealed that the aerodynamic efficiency during maneuvers such as climbing or turning could be optimized by adjusting the angles slightly more dynamically than in steady horizontal flight. This suggests that pilots could potentially enhance performance by adjusting their control surfaces in response to the specific phase of flight they are in. Moreover, the insights gained from the lift/drift ratios and the impact of stagger and plane orientation underline the importance of precise alignment and configuration in aircraft design. Designers could use this data to optimize wing configurations not only for maximum lift but also for better control and stability in various flight conditions. Further investigations could explore the effects of varying airspeeds and atmospheric conditions on these configurations to build a more comprehensive understanding of optimal aircraft performance across a wider range of scenarios. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations could refine these findings, offering a more detailed visualization of airflow patterns and forces, thereby enhancing the predictive capability of aircraft design models.	1912	2001.1976
"The light of the glowworm and the firefly have also been attributed to supernatural origin, and in the most remote antiquity there were "" sacred fires"" consisting of ignited natural gas and inflammable vapours issuing from the earth. It is very uncertain when man first learned the art of producing fire. The fable attributes to Prometheus the stealing of the art from heaven. Virgil and Pliny, both of the first century, mention the production of fire by striking stones together and by friction with pieces of wood. At a much later date both these methods were shown to be in common use among many savage races. Capt. Cook in 1770 witnessed and described the use of fire sticks by the natives * Illwn. tiny., Lond., May, 1912, p. 228. * Ilium. Eng., Lond., vol."	CXLVII, 1914, p. 342. of Australia. He observed how they rapidly rotated a pointed stick in a groove of a softer wood, generating enough heat through friction to ignite dry grass. This method, known as the fire-drill, is indeed one of the most ancient and widespread techniques for fire-making.  Similarly, the method of striking stones to produce sparks, which could then be caught on tinder, was not only mentioned by classical authors but has been documented as a technique used by various indigenous peoples across the globe, from the Americas to Siberia. This method typically involved flint or another hard stone and a piece of steel or pyrite. These ancient practices highlight the ingenuity of early humans in harnessing natural processes to meet essential needs. The ability to create fire was a pivotal development in human history, providing warmth, protection, and a means to cook food, which in turn had profound effects on nutrition and social organization. The mastery of fire is considered one of the key factors that allowed humans to thrive across various environments and eventually develop complex societies.	1912	1980.3236

Annual Dinner. The Annual Dinner of the Society will be held in the month of February. Full particulars of time and place will be circulated amongst members shortly. Unveiling of Statue to Sir George Livesey. ON Friday, December 8th, Earl Grey unveiled the statue of Sir George Livesey by Mr. Pomeroy, to which we have previously made reference In doing so he alluded to the great work of Sir George Livesey in connexion with copartnership and tlio great services rendered by him to the gas industry. * Ilium. Eng., vol. Hi., 1910, p. 432.	Earl Grey, in his speech, emphasized Sir George Livesey's vision and dedication, stating that his efforts were not only pivotal in transforming the gas sector but also in promoting the ideals of copartnership, which significantly improved worker satisfaction and productivity. He remarked on the enduring impact of such leadership that goes beyond mere business success to foster a sense of community and shared purpose among workers.  The statue, crafted with meticulous detail by Mr. Pomeroy, stands as a testament to Sir George's contributions. It captures the essence of his character: a stern yet fair countenance, the slight tilt of his head suggesting his forward-thinking nature. Located in a prominent public space, it serves as a constant reminder of the values he espoused. Following the unveiling, attendees, including distinguished guests from various sectors, shared their reflections on Sir George Livesey’s legacy. Many recounted personal anecdotes demonstrating his principles in practice, his integrity in business dealings, and his genuine concern for employee welfare. The event concluded with a call to current and future leaders to aspire to the standards Sir George set, encouraging a	1912	1977.9977
It is difficult to deny the bare possibility of this being true, though the advantage to be gained seems less obvious than in the former case. The benefit which a race derives from the death of its individual members is correlated with the inability of the individual not merely to adapt himself to new surroundings, but even tocontinueadapting himself to the conditionsof life to which he has been accustomed; and it does not seem to have been made out that the race fails in the latter respect, although it may be unequal to the former adaptation. Thus the interests of mankind are not so clearly implicated in the disappearance of races as the interests of a race are in the death of individuals. History tells us of many dead or decadent races.	Yet, it is the survival of their collective wisdom, traditions, and innovations that has often been absorbed and repurposed by thriving civilizations. In this way, the death of a race does not signify an absolute loss but rather a transformation and integration into broader human progress. The decadence or decline of a race may lead to a dispersal of its people and culture, seeding new ideas and practices in different parts of the world. This phenomenon, while complex and fraught with the tragedy of loss, contributes to the dynamic and ever-evolving tapestry of human society. The natural selection of races, much like that of individuals, involves a brutal calculus where adaptation to changing environments dictates survival. However, the notion of adaptation is not solely confined to biological or physical realms. Cultural, intellectual, and technological adaptations play equally critical roles. As such, the disappearance of a race, while a loss, is simultaneously an opportunity for their unique contributions to be disseminated and to enhance the collective human experience. Thus, while the direct benefits of race extinction are not apparent, the indirect influences on human development through the diffusion	1908	2000.2089
"I have been on the inside of the machinery of  473 ten legislatures in three states and have known personally every member of the ten bodies. In no other states does the government so nearly express the will of the people as in Oregon."" The state constitutions of Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Nevada, Arizona and Utah contain provisions for the initiative and referendum. Woodrow Wilson says: ""We are simply trying to square the facts of our government with the theory with which we have been deceiving ourselves. We do not mean to live any longer in a fool's paradise. We mean to have the kind of government we supposed we did have. If we cannot get the kind of legislation we want [need?] we will have the initiative and referendum, and where they have been tried, it is found that the people have just as discriminating a knowledge of what is necessary as any recent legislature, at any rate, has exhibited. My conviction is that when once this direct access of the people to the execution of their own purposes is accomplished, the initiative and referendum will not be the ordinary means of legislation."	Rather, it will act as a check upon the representatives, who will know that they cannot afford to ignore the clearly expressed preferences of their constituents. It will serve as a corrective mechanism, compelling legislators to adhere more closely to the public will, or face the prospect of having their decisions overturned by the direct action of the people. This system, in places where it has been implemented, has not only increased public participation in the legislative process but has also fostered a greater sense of responsibility among the electorate. The people begin to understand more deeply the implications of the laws and policies they are asked to consider, which in turn cultivates a more informed and engaged citizenry. Moreover, the initiative and referendum process can act as a powerful tool for reform, allowing citizens to circumvent a legislature that may be gridlocked or unduly influenced by special interests. It allows for the introduction of legislation that may not otherwise see the light of day, providing a pathway for necessary changes that have broad public support but lack legislative backing. In conclusion, while the initiative and referendum should not become the predominant method of lawmaking,	1911	1974.3344
Notice the force is one of pressure and not of tension. At first sight the impulse due to the impact would seem to be proportional to the effective area whereas according to Newton's law it ought to be proportional to the mass; but when we compare the diameter of a molecule with the distance between molecules, we see that only a small portion of the particles are arrested and that the number arrested is proportional to the number of molecules in the body (the mass). The objections to Le Sage's theory are almost too numerous to mention. First and foremost, the enormous speed at which these corpuscles must travel not to resist planetary motion involves an enormous supply of energy from a source outside our universe. On this theory the source of gravitation is ultramundane.	Moreover, the continuous bombardment of these high-velocity particles would generate an immense amount of heat, which is not observed. Additionally, Le Sage's model fails to explain why gravity is always attractive and never repulsive, as the theory suggests that the corpuscles push masses together rather than pulling them, which could theoretically result in repulsive forces under certain conditions. Another significant challenge is the shadowing effect; while Le Sage's theory posits that bodies are pushed together by the shadowing of these corpuscles, it does not account for the observed uniformity of gravitational force irrespective of the body's orientation or the nature of the surrounding bodies. This is inconsistent with the observed isotropic nature of gravity, where the force is dependent solely on mass and distance, not directional factors. Furthermore, the theory does not integrate well with the principles of modern physics, particularly the theory of relativity, which provides a more comprehensive and widely accepted explanation of gravitational phenomena through the curvature of spacetime rather than particle interactions. In conclusion, while Le Sage's theory of gravitation was an innovative attempt to explain gravity through mechanical	1911	1994.7028
In Mountgrove and Riversdale Roads, Highbury Vale, a number of people were killed, while a frightful disaster occurred in the church at the corner of Park Lane and Milton Road, Stoke Newington. Here a number of people had entered, attending a special service for the success of the British arms, when a shell exploded on the roof, bringing it down upon them and killing over fifty of the congregation, mostly women. The air, poisoned by the fumes of the deadly explosives and full of smoke from the burning buildings, was ever and anon rent by explosions as projectiles frequently burst in mid-air. The distant roar was incessant, like the noise of thunder, while on every hand could be heard the shrieks of defenceless women and children, or the muttered curses of some man who saw his home and all he possessed swept away with a flash and a cloud of dust.	The streets were littered with debris, and the pavements splashed with patches of blood and strewn with fragments of glass and stone. Every few yards lay the bodies of those struck down by shrapnel, their possessions scattered around them as silent testimony to lives abruptly ended. The emergency services were overwhelmed, with ambulances and fire engines navigating through the chaos, their sirens adding to the cacophony of sounds that filled the air. Volunteers and local residents, their faces grim and determined, banded together to provide what aid they could. makeshift shelters were hastily erected in safer quarters, where the wounded could receive rudimentary treatment and the displaced could gather. The community's spirit, though severely tested, showed resilience in the face of such horror. As night fell, the flickering flames from the numerous fires cast eerie shadows on the walls that still stood, painting a surreal picture of the devastation. Amidst the destruction, the church's spire, now a jagged stump, stood defiantly against the dark sky, a poignant reminder of the tragedy that had occurred within its now	1906	1998.7646

In work for the Federal Government this clause is often inserted : No member of or delegate to Congress, nor any person belonging to or employed in the . . . . . .	service of the United States, nor any member of the immediate family of the aforementioned, shall be admitted to any share or part of this contract or to any benefit that may arise therefrom. This is to ensure that the process remains free from undue influence or potential conflicts of interest that could compromise the integrity of the procurement process. 7. Confidentiality of Proposals. All proposals submitted shall be treated as confidential during the evaluation process. No details of the proposals, including the identity of the bidders, will be released to any unauthorized person until the award of the contract has been publicly announced. 8. Right to Reject Any and All Proposals. The Company reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received, and to waive any informality or irregularity in the proposals received. This right is retained to ensure that the Company can make the most appropriate decision without being bound to accept a proposal that does not meet its requirements or expectations. 9. Modifications to Proposals. Once submitted, no changes, modifications, or additions to the proposals will be allowed unless specifically requested by the Company. Bidders are	1913	1948.803
(4) The Chief Judge. The Chief Judge could be appointed by the Caliph or the Wazir. According to Abu Hanifa in some cases, and according to Abu JarirTabary, a non muslim can be appointed to administer the law of his co religionists. The Chief Judge, as representative of the law of Islam, can depose the Caliph — he can kill his own creator. His death means the dismissal of his staff; but the death of the sovereign is not followed by the dismissal of the judges appointed by him. During an interregnum a judge can be elected by the people of a town, but not during the sovereign's lifetime. (5) President of the Highest Court of Appeal and general control.	The President of the Highest Court of Appeal holds a significant position within the judicial hierarchy, acting as the ultimate arbiter in legal disputes. This role encompasses oversight of all appellate matters and the power to review decisions made by lower courts. The individual appointed to this position must exhibit not only a deep understanding of the law but also an unwavering commitment to justice and fairness. This office also entails general control over the judiciary, ensuring that all courts operate smoothly and efficiently. The President is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the judicial system and upholding the principles laid out in Islamic law. They must also ensure that the rights of all citizens are protected and that legal proceedings are conducted without bias or favoritism. (6) Appointment and Supervision of Judges. The appointment of judges is a prerogative of the Chief Judge, under the guidance of the Caliph or Wazir. Judges must be well-versed in Islamic law and possess both the moral integrity and intellectual capacity to interpret and apply the law impartially. Once appointed, judges are subject to the supervision of the Chief Judge, who monitors	1908	1983.5426
"shouted the old man. "" I won't be argued with when I'M talking. "" The way he hates you isn't anything compared to the way my great  93 niece Hessie Smuts hates Cornelius. She says he comes skulking round their farmhouse like a Kaffir's dog looking for a bone, and that his looks remind her of a hyena, and that — Nephew! There's that donkeyhead outside the door again!"" "" Cornelius!"" shouted his father, "" go into the stable, or I'Ll sjambok you with my hippopotamus hide whip."" Oom Piet had evidently come back to stay. As for his matrimonial projects, whether they had proved realisable or not, they had obviously been postponed, for the old gentleman showed no signs of any inclination to depart. Day by day his tyranny increased. Lolling back in the comfortable chair, his pipe in his mouth and the red woollen nightcap stuck grotesquely over his ears, he ruled the household with a rod of steel."	"His orders were law, and woe betide anyone who dared question his authority. The servants walked on tiptoes, and the family spoke in hushed whispers, lest they provoke his wrath. Even the dogs seemed to sense the change in atmosphere, skulking around with their tails between their legs. Every morning, Oom Piet would issue his decrees from the head of the breakfast table, his voice booming through the room like thunder. ""Cornelius, you lazy scoundrel, I want those fields plowed by noon!"" or ""Martha, make sure those linens are washed and dried before the sun sets!"" His demands were relentless, and everyone scurried to fulfill his every whim. The evenings were no better. After supper, he would regale the family with tales of his youth, each story more exaggerated than the last. His laughter was loud and grating, and it filled the room with a sense of unease. The family would nod and smile, but their eyes were tired, their spirits worn down by the constant barrage of his presence. As"	1913	1899.3046

The principles set forth in these cases form a cornerstone in the jurisprudence concerning the interpretation of contractual obligations and the resolution of disputes arising therefrom. In Stewlahrt v. Whea, the court emphasized the importance of the intent of the parties at the time of contract formation, noting that any ambiguities in the contract should be construed against the drafter, a doctrine known as contra proferentem. This principle was further explored in Miller v. R‘‘P, where the court held that clear and explicit terms must guide the enforcement of contract provisions, thereby reinforcing the sanctity of the written agreement. Similarly, in Weir Plough Co. v. Alinsle, the focus was on the performance standards expected under the contract, with the court determining that performance must not only meet the specific terms but also align with industry standards and practices to be deemed satisfactory. Lastly, Ball v. Newton addressed the issue of consequential damages, ruling that such damages should be clearly stipulated in the contract if they are to be recoverable, thus underscoring the need for explicitness	1913	1909.538
The ester of phosphoric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, CH2OH .CHOH.CH.OPO3H2, which is found in traces in the urine and blood, is contained in lecithine and other phospholipines, widely distributed through the animal and vegetable kingdoms. It is obtained by the saponification of these compounds with baryta as a soluble barium salt; and it can be synthesised by the action of phosphorus pentoxide or of metaphosphoric acid upon glycerol. Its calcium salt is more soluble in cold than in hot water, and can be obtained in glistening scales by heating a strong solution. The free acid is unstable. 2. The Glycerides of Fatty Acids.	These are esters formed between glycerol and fatty acids, and they constitute the primary components of natural fats and oils. Glycerides can be either simple, containing only one type of fatty acid, or mixed, containing two or three different fatty acids. The most common glycerides found in nature are triglycerides, where three fatty acid molecules are esterified with each glycerol molecule. During the hydrolysis of fats, either by enzymatic action or by chemical means such as saponification, glycerol and free fatty acids are produced. This process is crucial in the digestion and metabolism of dietary fats. Triglycerides are particularly important as they are the main form of stored energy in animals and also provide thermal insulation and protection to vital organs. In industries, glycerides are modified to produce a variety of products such as soaps, detergents, and emulsifiers. The process of hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids in triglycerides leads to the production of margarine and shortening, which are used extensively in food preparation. The physical	1913	1996.8457
Again, on the Cross at Kirby Stephen is a rude carving of a male figure bound like a malefactor. The curious part of this is that it has conspicuous horns. Calverley and Stephens call it' Loki bound, ' in reference to a myth which we shall meet later. This may be its true explanation, but it is also possible to refer it to Satan, who was to be bound ' a thousand years' and cast into the ' bottomless pit.' * I 1 Calverley, p. S * Crux benedict a and Pange lingua. •Rev.	J. Stephens, in his extensive treatises on religious iconography, argues that the depiction of horned figures in Christian art often symbolizes the eternal struggle between good and evil, with horns representing the diabolical or the pagan. The intertwining of Christian and pagan motifs in medieval art is not uncommon, reflecting the complex process of religious transformation and synthesis that occurred during the period.  Furthermore, the image of Loki, a trickster god from Norse mythology who is bound as punishment, shares thematic similarities with the Christian narrative of Satan's binding. Both figures are associated with chaos and deception, and their confinement represents a temporary restoration of order. This dual reference in the carving at Kirby Stephen could be seen as an artistic expression of these overlapping theological themes, serving both as a moral lesson and as a symbolic representation of the triumph of order over chaos.  In this light, the figure with horns might simultaneously evoke Loki and the Christian Devil, each bound and subdued, symbolizing a broader, transcultural acknowledgment of the forces of chaos being restrained by the divine order. Such interpretations highlight the rich tapestry	1904	2004.3258
It is fortunate in its physical environment; still more so in the spirit of the place. More biological research is accomplished there during its season than in any other institution in the world. Both in its formal organisation and in its real life it is more democratic than any other American institution devoted to education and research. The result has been, on the one hand, a share of dissensions and poverty; on the other hand, a rare exhibition of cooperation and loyalty. It is false to assume that a democracy should not have leaders. In an autocracy masters hold the reins of authority; in a democracy a leader is followed because he is recognised as such.	The true leader in a democracy arises from among the people, embodying their aspirations, understanding their needs, and sharing their struggles. He does not impose authority but earns respect through his wisdom, integrity, and dedication to the common good. This form of leadership fosters a deep sense of commitment and collaboration among the members of the community.  At this institution, leadership is not about wielding power but about empowering others. The leaders are facilitators who encourage innovation, nurture talent, and promote an environment where free thought and scholarly inquiry can flourish. They are the catalysts for the cooperative spirit that pervades the place, inspiring all to contribute their best efforts. This democratic ethos, coupled with a commitment to excellence in research and education, creates a vibrant community that is both intellectually stimulating and supportive. Thus, while the institution may face challenges like any other, the resilience and dedication of its community continue to drive its success, making it a unique and influential force in the world of scientific research and education.	1911	1992.2477
"And we find lastly that the theory of co heirship of all men to the soil is consistent with the highest civilization; and that however difficult it may be to embody that theory in fact, equity sternly commands it to be done."" — Herbert Spencer. THE BATTLE FOR MEDICAL FREEDOM The Record of Ten Months AT the present writing Congress has adjourned, and the desperate effort of organised medicine has failed to successfully carry any of the numerous bills fostered by the American Medical Association and the Marine Hospital Bureau, despite the pernicious activity of President Taft, the administration forces and the perfectly organised political machine of the great trust promoting American Medical Association and its allies. One year ago the defeat of all the trust measures would have seemed impossible, for the carefully laid plains that were to secure for the American Medical Association the legislation it has been seeking for twenty years, seemed ready for fruition."	Yet, against all odds, the tide of public opinion and the vigilant actions of those who championed medical freedom turned the scales. This battle, though fierce and fraught with the potential to reshape the medical landscape of America, has showcased the resilience and determination of those unwilling to see the medical profession become monopolized by a single entity. The conflict was not merely about different medical philosophies; it was a struggle for the soul of American healthcare. Throughout the ten months of intense lobbying, debates, and public discourse, several key issues emerged. The proposed legislation would have granted unprecedented control over medical licensure and practice standards to the American Medical Association, effectively marginalizing other practitioners and methods of healing. This raised serious concerns about the future diversity and accessibility of healthcare services, potentially stifling innovative approaches to medicine that do not align with the mainstream. Moreover, the involvement of the Marine Hospital Bureau highlighted the intertwining of medical governance with federal authority, a prospect that alarmed many who feared the erosion of patient choice and the autonomy of medical professionals. Critics argued that such consolidation of power would lead to a homogenization	1911	1999.2965
"Prince Henry signalled back : ' Dispatch train to Burnham ' ; and then also signalled to OC. 23 Division at Burnham : ' Expect train of eight coaches at once. Entrain as many infantry as it will hold, and send them to Maldon with the utmost dispatch.' "" While these signals were passing, I was employed in taking a careful survey with my glasses. This is what I saw, looking from right to left. The green and white lance pennons of a detachment of the hussars belonging to the 32nd Division came fluttering round the shoulder of the hill topped by the grey tower of St. Lawrence."	Behind them, a line of artillery was positioning their guns, a grim array of cannon that seemed to stretch endlessly. The air was filled with the sharp tang of metal and horse sweat, punctuated by the occasional command shouted over the din of preparation. Nearer to my position, a group of engineers was hastily constructing a makeshift bridge across a small creek, their movements precise and hurried. To the left, the infantry of the 23rd Division was forming up, a sea of khaki that moved with a disciplined chaos. Their faces were set, determined, each man a cog in the great war machine, ready to be transported to Maldon. The ground vibrated under the feet of the marching men, a low rumble that spoke of urgency and the imminence of conflict. Overhead, the sky was a patchwork of clouds and blue, the sun occasionally peeking through to glint off bayonets and helmets. A squadron of reconnaissance planes buzzed in the distance, tiny specks against the vastness, their engines a distant hum. As I lowered my glasses,	1906	1982.8434
GAHBICK reached Paris some time in October, and during the next six months he was a centre of attraction for the whole capital. The three great salons in which the philosophers congregated threw open both doors to receive him.	He was welcomed with the eager curiosity and respect accorded to a man whose reputation had preceded him like a herald's trumpet. The evenings spent in those opulent drawing rooms, filled with the cream of intellectual Paris, were charged with the sort of electric excitement that comes from the meeting of great minds. Gabrick, with his keen insights and nimble wit, proved more than equal to the challenge. He debated with philosophers, exchanged ideas with scientists, and sparred playfully with literati. Everywhere he went, his opinions were sought after, his approval coveted. The discussions he participated in ranged widely—from the nature of liberty to the principles of aesthetics, from the latest theories in natural sciences to the timeless dilemmas of moral philosophy. His ability to weave philosophy with the daily concerns of society fascinated everyone, making his companions consider not only the abstract but also the practical implications of their ideas. As winter deepened and the chill set into the bones of the city, the warmth of spirited debate and rich camaraderie in those salons seemed to hold the cold at bay. Gabrick found himself	1912	1897.4335
"Desdemona, her lovely gaze upon him, might seem to consider for a moment, and then shake her lovely head. Yet, not wishing to appear as though slighting his suggestion: "" I think ' dose ' might do very nicely if it were a doctor writing it, or if it were humorous poetry; but you see, dearest"" — the tone liquidly sweet, as were all Desdemona's tones — "" in these love sonnets — "" Bursting"" into such an atmosphere might — probably would — come Dennis Kilpatrick, somewhat stocky of build, to stumble over the rug and bump his nose on the piano leg, or Susannah Briggs, efficiently driving the cat and puppy harnessed to the toy automobile. "" Why doesn't Maggie keep them out ?"" Philip was constantly moved to inquire, but Maggie, whose life did not even remotely suggest a poet's dream, had everything else to do also, and of this Desdemona was vaguely aware. "" I think, "" she one day confided to Philip, "" that they could learn to stay out without bothering Maggie all the time. I think they're old enough to be taught to — mind."" The idea had the force of entire novelty to Philip, and it appealed to him as any idea of Desdemona's did. """	"Why, yes, of course,"" he agreed, his voice carrying the gentle enthusiasm that Desdemona's suggestions always sparked within him. ""It's quite a sensible notion, indeed. We must set about teaching them some small measure of discipline."" Philip was not a man naturally inclined to the rigors of training animals—or children, for that matter. Yet, inspired by Desdemona's delicate wisdom, he felt a surge of resolve. ""Perhaps a little training session each day,"" he proposed, warming to his theme, ""a few minutes of gentle instruction. We could make it quite enjoyable."" Desdemona clapped her hands lightly, the sound like the softest rainfall. ""Oh, Philip, that would be delightful! A little school for our furry and little ones. We could teach them not to enter the drawing room or disturb my writing hours."" Her eyes sparkled with the vision of a peaceful household, her sonnets flowing uninterrupted, the pets dutifully observing the boundaries set for them. ""And perhaps,"" Philip added, daring to expand upon the thought, ""we might teach"	1913	1950.6896
by weight of the cement), which gives the highest possible tensile strength. Cement increases considerably in resistance both to tension and crushing, with age from the time of setting consequently the age and treatment of briquettes after mixing must be specified; the increase of resistance to crushing is fortunately greater than the increase of tensile strength. The tensile breaking load of a briquette is considerably affected by the rate at which the load is applied increasing with increase of speed Fig. 235. Fig. 236. 1 See papers by Mr. J. Grant, Proc. Inst. Civ. Eng., vols. xxv.	and xxvi., where detailed experiments and observations on the behavior of cement under various conditions are discussed. In these studies, Mr. Grant emphasizes the significance of curing conditions and their impact on the ultimate strength of cement. He notes that a controlled environment with consistent moisture and temperature levels can significantly enhance the curing process, leading to a more uniform and stronger cement mixture. Furthermore, the composition of the cement itself plays a crucial role. The proportions of silica, alumina, and lime, among other components, determine the chemical reactions during the hydration process and ultimately affect the physical properties of the cement. The fineness of grinding of the cement particles also influences the rate of hydration and thus the development of strength over time. It is also essential to consider the water-cement ratio. An optimal ratio is critical because too much water can lead to higher porosity and lower strength, while too little water can impede the hydration process, preventing the cement from achieving its full strength potential.  Continued research and experimentation are imperative for understanding the complex chemistry and mechanics of cement and for developing formulations that meet specific engineering requirements	1908	1996.316
This sudden change, managed without exaggeration or jerkiness, has an astonishing effect and produces a complete illusion. None of the characters are neglected; all make their effect. His face, which passes rapidly to the expression required, is always correct. To the perfection of his reading he adds all the little accessories of costume in the pieces he reads. Two recitals have been sufficient to establish his reputation, and soon nobody else was talked about. Our princes desired to hear him; everybody wanted to have him at supper ; it was a perfect madness; but it must be confessed that nothing is more extraordinary or more agreeable. . .	His voice, capable of the most varied inflections, seemed to embody the very souls of the characters he portrayed, giving life to the words with an art that was almost magical. The audiences were spellbound, hanging on every syllable, transported into the world he conjured with mere tones and gestures. Each evening he performed, the halls were packed, the crowds spilling out into the streets, all eager for a chance to witness his genius. The subtlety of his performances lay not just in the grand gestures or the dramatic pauses, but in the fleeting expressions that crossed his face, the slight tremors of his voice that hinted at unspoken tragedies or unbridled joy. These nuances made each performance a unique experience, a masterclass in the art of storytelling. Critics praised him, not merely for his technical prowess, but for the depth of emotion he brought to his roles. He was not merely acting; he was living through each moment, each emotion, making it real not just for himself but for everyone who watched. As his fame grew, so did the tales of his	1912	1958.433
In this case the two rules would give the same result, but in many cases they would not. The second of these two rules for the filling of seats not filled by the first assignment explains itself. The first of them may seem merely  arbitrary. In fact, however, the first rule, though not, in my personal opinion, so fair as the second one, is based on a principle. The principle is that each seat remaining unassigned after the first assignment on full quotas shall be assigned to the list which, if it is assigned the additional seat in question, will have behind each of its members the largest part of a full quota.	This method ensures that the representation is as proportionate as possible within the constraints of available seats and the distribution of votes. It attempts to minimize the number of votes that do not contribute to the election of a representative, thus adhering to the principle of fairness in electoral representation. The operation of this rule might be illustrated by considering a simple example. Suppose there are three parties, A, B, and C, competing for five seats in an assembly. Party A receives 4800 votes, Party B 3600, and Party C 1600. If the quota (the number of votes required to secure one seat) is 2000, Party A initially secures two seats and Party B one seat, using up 6000 of the total 10000 votes. The remaining 4000 votes are then considered for the distribution of the two remaining seats. Under the first rule, the next seat would go to Party A, which would then have three seats with each seat representing approximately 1600 votes (4800/3). This leaves Party B with one seat and Party C with	1914	1963.9602
— Figure 80 illustrates the manner in which parcels increase their velocity as they pass over the top of a hill or a crest of terrain. To the left of the diagram is a scale of altitude. All parcels at the left of the diagram must also pass over the top of the hill. If the parcels at the extreme top are not pushed upward but flow horizontally, then all the parcels below this level must pass through a constricted space  defined by this level and the top of the hill. Assuming little or no accumulation of air on the windward side of the hill, the only way by which all the parcels can get beyond the crest is by increased velocity over the hilltop. Practically every uphill wind is one of increasing velocities until the top of the terrain is reached, at which place the velocity is a maximum.	— As the parcels descend the leeward side of the hill, the velocity usually decreases. This deceleration is due to the expansion of the air as it moves downward and the reduction in pressure exerted on it. Additionally, the gravitational pull helps in accelerating the air downwards initially, but as the slope levels off, the force of gravity diminishes, leading to a gradual reduction in speed. This phenomenon is analogous to water flowing over a dam; the water speeds up over the crest and slows down as it falls, spreading out over a wider area. — The diagram also shows several arrows indicating the direction of airflow. These arrows get longer as they approach the hilltop, symbolizing the increasing speed. Conversely, as the air moves down the leeward side, the arrows shorten, indicating the slowing momentum of the air parcels. This visual representation helps in understanding the dynamic changes in air movement caused by the topographical features. — It is important to note that the behavior of air parcels over hills or mountains can significantly affect local weather conditions. For instance, as air speeds up and rises over a hill	1913	1983.6727
"Why, the outspread wings of the largest must have measured ten or twelve inches across, and many of the smaller varieties were more than six inches across. I wonder what our naturalists would say if they could see some specimens of these large and splendidly coloured insects! "" ""Well, Professor, "" he answered, ""I never saw such large butterflies anywhere else, not even when I was in the tropics on our own world. It had never occurred to me that gravitation, or even the density of the air, had anything to do with their size. Even now I do not understand how it is the small insects are able to fly, for they are heavy for their size, and do not possess very large wings, yet they can move very swiftly."""	"""Indeed,"" the Professor mused, adjusting his spectacles as he peered more closely at a particularly vibrant specimen perched delicately on a nearby fern. ""It appears that the very laws of nature, as we understand them, are different here. Perhaps the air is denser, or the force of gravity less stringent, allowing these creatures to grow to such magnificent proportions and still navigate the air with such agility."" He paused, lost in thought, then continued, ""Consider the implications, my dear fellow. If we can study and understand the mechanics of flight in this environment, it could revolutionize our understanding of aerodynamics back on Earth. The potential applications are boundless – from engineering lighter, more efficient aircraft to perhaps even rethinking our approach to space travel."" The young man nodded, clearly intrigued by the Professor's musings. ""And what about the colors? I've never seen such iridescence on Earth. Each wing seems to shimmer with a life of its own."" ""Ah, yes, the colors,"" the Professor chuckled softly. ""That is another mystery altogether."	1911	1953.2249
In justice to the Socialists, it should be observed that the party on the whole made astonishing gains in the spring elections. Ten cities now have Socialist mayors, including Milwuakee, with over 373,000 inhabitants; Berkeley, California, with over 40,000; Butte, Montana, with over 39,000; and Flint, Michigan, with over 38,000. In Milwaukee there was a combination of the Roman Catholics, who marshalled their solid voting strength, including their women who took a most active part'under the direction of the church leaders, and the Republicans and Democrats. The immediate result of this triple alliance was not favourable to the Socialists, the ticket of the combined opposition for school committee, judges and aldermen being successful.	Nonetheless, the Socialist party maintained a strong presence in the city council, holding a significant number of seats which allowed them to influence policy and public discourse. This was indicative of a broader national trend where Socialism was gradually gaining ground, not just in urban centers but also in smaller towns that were traditionally conservative.  The success in these diverse locales suggested a shifting political landscape, where the working class and disenfranchised groups were finding a voice through Socialist platforms. These platforms typically advocated for workers' rights, social welfare programs, and municipal ownership of utilities, which resonated with citizens who felt neglected by the traditional two-party system. Moreover, the involvement of women in the political process, as seen in Milwaukee, highlighted another dimension of the Socialist expansion. As more women became politically active, they brought with them concerns about child labor, public health, and education—issues that were often addressed by Socialist policies. The growth of the Socialist party also prompted reactions from both the Republican and Democratic parties, which began to adopt more progressive policies in an attempt to recapture lost votes. This, in turn,	1911	2005.4639
It may be , hoped that our association will in 1915 , meet on the Pacific coast and at Hawaii. It might be possible to arrange that those members who were able should proceed to Australasia to attend the meetings there, while British and Australian men of science might join our association at Hawaii and in California, with an opportunity to visit 'the' San Francisco Exposition, which should aim to surpass the St. Louis Exposition in its scientific congresses. 520 A HANDBOOK OF UNIVERSITIES Minerva, which for twenty years has been an invaluable annual for university men, has issued as a supplement a volume containing details of the organisation of universities and colleges throughout the world. It is to be followed by a second volume with similar material in regard to libraries, museums, observatories, etc. A vast amount of information is packed into 623 pages, printed in type almost too small to be legible. Like the annual issue of Minerva, it is edited with unusual accuracy, but, as is likely to be the case, the material appears to be the more satisfactory, the less the firsthand knowledge of the reader.	The editors have evidently made a commendable effort to compile and condense data from a wide range of sources, and their work will undoubtedly serve as a critical resource for those involved in the academic and scientific communities. However, the sheer breadth of information covered can sometimes lead to a slight dilution of detail, particularly for those well-versed in specific fields who might be seeking in-depth knowledge. Continuing with our discussion on global academic networks, it is increasingly clear that these connections and the sharing of knowledge they facilitate are crucial not only for the advancement of individual fields but also for fostering international cooperation and understanding. As the world grows more interconnected, the role of comprehensive guides like Minerva's becomes even more pivotal. They not only help in navigating the complex landscapes of global academia but also in building bridges between diverse intellectual communities. This collaborative spirit is particularly important as we approach events like the proposed meetings in Hawaii and California, which promise to bring together a multitude of perspectives and expertise. The potential for these gatherings to contribute to global scientific dialogue is immense, particularly if they can integrate the insights and discoveries presented at	1911	1994.8033
"So that by comparing the height required in the "" atmosphere"" of gamboge with that required for hydrogen or for air, their relative densities are determined; and as it is known that equal numbers of molecules, at the same temperature, exert the same pressure, and as the number of particles of gamboge in a known volume had been counted, it follows that the number of particles — that is, of molecules — in the same volume of air or of hydrogen can be reckoned, for it is identical. An ordinary thimble holds about three cubic centimetres; the number of molecules of air which fills it is expressed by one followed by twenty naughts, pr a hundred million million million. And knowing the relative weights of the same volume of hydrogen and of gamboge particles, exerting the same pressure, and at the same temperature, the weight of a molecule of hydrogen can be calculated; there are four followed by twenty-six naughts in a grain weight."	"This calculation of molecular weights, based on such precise measurements and comparisons, has revolutionized our understanding of the atomic world. The implications are far-reaching, not only in the field of chemistry but also in physics and even biology. By understanding the molecular structure and its weight, scientists can predict the behavior of substances under different conditions, synthesize new materials, and explore the interactions between different molecules. Furthermore, this understanding aids in the development of various technologies, including the creation of more efficient fuels, the improvement of drug delivery systems, and the design of better catalysts for industrial processes. The precise knowledge of molecular weights and densities also plays a crucial role in environmental monitoring and protection, allowing for more accurate predictions of pollutant behavior and the design of more effective filters and scrubbers. Thus, the seemingly esoteric calculation of molecular weights from the heights of different gases in an ""atmosphere"" of gamboge not only deepens our fundamental understanding of the natural world but also propels forward numerous practical applications that impact our daily lives and the health of our planet."	1913	2001.8792
(iii) A recording apparatus was devised for registering the velocity at any one point. A thin vertical wire was stretched between two points, and a light horizontal straw arm attached to the middle of the wire. At one end of the straw was fastened a paper disc, on a straw backing, to serve as a pressure face; the other end of the straw scribed the record on smoked paper on a revolving drum. The velocity recorded showed marked variations: the mean vilu obtained at a certain point, after applying some corrections, was O049. This agreed with the result obtained at the same point by method (ii). It is shown that the measurements made lead to a formula for the Recknagell disc The formula given by Recknagell was p=l 37«£ It is further explained that the velocities in the Koutchino air channel as previously measured were shown by the above investigation to be 3 percent, too high. All the velocities given in Vols. I iii of the Koutchino Bulletin thus require to be reduced by this amount. 194.	(iv) Further analyses were conducted to understand the discrepancies observed between the recorded velocities and those previously documented. The investigation extended to reassessing the calibration of the recording devices and the environmental conditions during the previous measurements. It was hypothesized that shifts in air density and temperature variations might have impacted the initial readings.  Subsequent experiments were designed to test these variables systematically. A new set of measurements was taken under controlled temperature and humidity conditions to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on the velocity readings. Additionally, the alignment and tension of the wire and the condition of the smoked paper on the revolving drum were meticulously checked and adjusted to ensure consistency and accuracy in the recordings. These measures resulted in a refined understanding of the factors influencing the velocity measurements in the air channel. The revised data suggested a more accurate representation of the air flow dynamics, leading to an updated set of corrections that were applied to the existing data. The results were compiled and cross-referenced with theoretical models to validate the accuracy of the Recknagell formula under specified conditions. This comprehensive approach helped in solidifying the understanding of the aer	1912	1994.809
"Chastity, on the other hand, is so despised that many a really pure lad attempts to appear a blase roue. It is even true that those who are modest are ashamed of the feeling; but there is another, the modern form of shame — not the eroticist's shame, but the shame of the woman who has no lover, who has not received appraisement from the opposite sex. Hence it comes that men make it their business to tell each other what a right and proper pleasure they take in "" doing their duty"" by the opposite sex."	This perverse inversion of values leads to a curious social dynamic where the truly virtuous may feel compelled to disguise their virtues, lest they be thought peculiar or naive. Meanwhile, those less scrupulous revel in exaggerated tales of conquest, believing that such stories affirm their desirability and prowess. The result is a milieu in which superficiality reigns, and deeper, more meaningful connections are often sacrificed on the altar of social perception. In such an environment, the individual who yearns for genuine intimacy finds themselves navigating a labyrinth of pretense and misrepresentation. The challenge becomes not only finding another who shares a desire for authenticity but also discerning truth amidst the widespread posturing. This modern shame—this societal pressure to be seen as romantically or sexually active—is a poignant reflection of broader cultural anxieties about loneliness, worth, and belonging. It is a sad irony that in an age which proclaims liberation and the breaking of taboos, many are trapped in a new kind of cage, constrained not by old-fashioned prudery but by a relentless demand for outward show of experience and sophistication.	1911	1972.3412
But that does not prove that cooperationis not better than competition. It simply means that if those engaged in public callings will not voluntarily do what they should do, then the public should make them do so. Competition has failed, and the public has had to undertake the protection of its own rights. The same weapons which have been used by the public to protect its rights while the law of competition has been in progress would avail if the law of cooperation were in progress, only more effectively. The ideal thing would be to have public callings do what they should without compulsion, but if they will not, the next best thing is to compel them to do what they should. Yet this compulsion should be in the spirit of cooperation.	It should involve not merely the enforcement of rules and regulations but the fostering of a culture where entities recognize the mutual benefits of working together for the common good. This shift from competition to cooperation can be facilitated by creating frameworks that encourage collaboration while still holding parties accountable.  For instance, in industries where monopolistic practices or the undercutting of prices to eliminate competition have been prevalent, regulatory bodies can introduce incentives for companies that actively engage in fair trade practices, share resources for innovation, or contribute to community and environmental sustainability. Such measures would not only ensure that businesses operate within ethical boundaries but also promote a cooperative environment where the collective success is valued over individual gain. Moreover, educational initiatives could play a crucial role in this transformation. By integrating principles of cooperation into the education system—from elementary levels up through higher education—future generations can be equipped with the mindset and skills necessary for collaborative problem-solving and leadership. This educational approach would help to naturally decrease the reliance on strict regulatory measures over time, as more individuals and organizations naturally adopt a cooperative stance. Ultimately, cooperation should not be seen as merely a regulatory strategy but	1911	2006.4071
"How can you — how can you refuse — to help anybody as wretched as I am!"" The small, chubby face and slight figure had assumed a certain tragic force. The impression indeed was of some one absolutely at bay, at the bitter end of their resources and therefore reckless as to what might be thought of them. And yet there was still the slight theatrical touch; as though the speaker observed herself, even in violence. Marcia — troubled, intimidated — watched her in silence a few moments and then said: ""How can I possibly help you, Mrs. Bets? You shouldn't have come to me — you shouldn't indeed. I don't know your story, and if I did I shouldn't understand it. Why didn't you ask to see my mother?"" 894 "" Lady Coryston would never look at the likes of me !"""	"Mrs. Bets exclaimed with a half-despairing, half-mocking laugh. ""She sits so high in her tower, madam, that us common folk don't even dare to knock at her gate. But you—Miss Marcia—you've a kinder face, and I thought maybe you'd lend an ear to a poor soul in trouble."" Marcia's expression softened, her initial hesitation giving way to a compassionate curiosity. ""Tell me what it is you seek, Mrs. Bets. If it is within my power, I might be able to do something for you."" Mrs. Bets glanced around furtively, as if afraid of being overheard, then leaned forward, lowering her voice to a desperate whisper. ""It's my husband, see? He’s got himself mixed up in some bad business—something dreadful. I don't know all the particulars. He won’t tell me everything, but it’s enough to ruin us, to tear our little family apart. I’ve nowhere else to turn."" Marcia listened, her heart clenching at the woman"	1913	1916.7745
"In many cases, , the pension paid to the aged will be treated as a discharge from responsibility by children, who ought to support their parents, employers, who ought to pension their old servants, friends, who ought to prove their friendship, charitable people, who desire to relieve distress and to show kindness — who now exercise their several functions to the good of giver and receiver alike, and for whom the State will substitute a pension officer and his staff. Much of the discussion of the question has turned upon the distinction between contributory and non contributory schemes. These terms do not quite accurately define the point at issue. AH pension funds must be raised by contribution. The ""contributory"" scheme is one in which that contribution is made by or on behalf of the person who requires the pension."	"The ""non-contributory"" scheme, on the other hand, is one where the funds are derived from general taxation or other public sources, and the recipients are not required to have made direct contributions to qualify for the pension. The argument in favor of the contributory scheme is that it fosters a sense of responsibility and self-reliance among the beneficiaries. It is thought to encourage prudent financial planning and saving during one's working years. Critics, however, point out that such schemes can be regressive, placing a disproportionate financial burden on lower-income workers who may struggle to contribute enough to secure a meaningful pension. Non-contributory pensions, while potentially more inclusive and capable of addressing immediate poverty among the elderly, raise concerns about sustainability and dependency. They rely heavily on the fiscal capacity of the state and the political will to allocate sufficient resources. Moreover, there is the moral argument that non-contributory schemes might weaken familial and communal bonds, as the responsibility for the welfare of the elderly shifts from the family and community to the state. In either case, the implementation of pension schemes must be carefully considered,"	1908	1981.5159
"could reach them. Under this cross hurricane of projectiles the British fire was quite beaten down, and the Germans followed up their skirmishers by almost solid masses, which advanced with all but impunity save for  the fire of the few British long range guns at Pleshy Mount. There they were firing almost at random, as the gunners could not be certain of the exact whereabouts of their objectives. There was a searchlight on the knoll, but at the first sweep of its ray it was absolutely demolished by a blizzard of shrapnel. Every German gun was turned upon it. The Hanoverian battalions now swarmed to the assault, disregarding the gaps made in their ranks by the magazine fire of the defenders as soon as their close advance masked the fire of their own cannon. """	They pressed on with an almost mechanical steadiness, each man stepping into the place of a fallen comrade without hesitation. The air was filled with the deafening roar of artillery, the harsh rattle of rifle fire, and the screams of the wounded. Despite their losses, the German forces maintained their momentum, driven by the relentless commands of their officers who walked behind the lines, urging their men forward. The British soldiers, though outnumbered and outgunned, fought with a desperate tenacity. From the trenches and improvised barricades, they unleashed a steady stream of fire, trying to stem the tide of gray uniforms that surged towards them. The ground between the two armies was littered with bodies, and the air was thick with smoke and the acrid stench of gunpowder. As the battle wore on, the situation grew increasingly grim for the British defenders. Ammunition began to run low, and the relentless German advance forced them back towards their secondary defenses. The commanders on the ground sent urgent requests for reinforcements and supplies, but whether these could arrive in time to make a difference was	1906	1962.7349
"It is as well that your paper should ventilate all views, but it is astonishing to find your correspondent Jane Craig venturing to class a normal function like sexual intercourse with "" stealing, drinking, lying, gambling."" Such an expression of opinion merely presupposes a mental or physical abnormality, which is not suitably expressed in terms of superior morality. As to Mrs. P. Sherwen's notion that ""the sex relationship should be held absolutely sacred to the production of children, "" it is as rational as it would be to say that a man should never walk except to his office. All natural functions require exercise, even when not employed on purely utilitarian purposes. The sex instinct flows over into aesthetic expression, which is by no means connected with the production of children, but aesthetic expression is not generally condemned. It is lamentable to think that women should ever have been educated in such false notions, which spring only from the natural anxiety of parents and guardians to preserve their daughters from the cruelty of society at large to women. A."	B. Smith's letter, therefore, serves as a necessary counterpoint to the views expressed by Jane Craig and Mrs. P. Sherwen. It reminds us of the broader, more nuanced understanding of human behaviors and relationships that modern society strives to acknowledge and respect. The reduction of any natural human experience to mere utility—or worse, equating it with moral failings—is a disservice not only to the complexity of human nature but also to the progress we have made in understanding psychological and emotional health. It is crucial that we continue to challenge such restrictive views and foster a dialogue that recognizes the multifaceted nature of human existence. The discussion of sexuality, in particular, should not be shrouded in misinformation or moral panic but should be approached with openness and informed by scientific understanding and respect for personal autonomy. In this light, it is essential for publications like yours to present a balanced spectrum of opinions, allowing readers to navigate these complex issues with a more informed perspective. Only through such comprehensive discourse can we hope to cultivate a society that values both the sanctity of personal choices and the scientific insights that	1911	2002.4117
Simply supported Beam with non central Load. — Let W be a load concentrated at a distance a from one support A (Fig. n6), and b  from the other support, B, the span being a + b = I. The reaction RA at A is evidently — — T e.w and RB = — -- .W a + b a + b Suppose that a is greater than b.	The reaction at A will thus be larger than the reaction at B because the load W is closer to A than to B. Using the principle of moments about point B, we can calculate the reaction at A as follows: \[ R_A = \frac{b}{l}W \] Similarly, by taking moments about point A, the reaction at B can be determined: \[ R_B = \frac{a}{l}W \] Now, considering the bending moment at any point x from support A (where x < a), the bending moment equation M(x) is given by: \[ M(x) = R_A x - W(x - a) \] For the region where x > a, the load W has already been passed, so the bending moment equation simplifies to: \[ M(x) = R_A x \] The maximum bending moment occurs where x = a (directly under the load W), and it can be calculated by substituting x = a into the bending moment equation for x < a: \[ M_{max} = R_A a - W(a	1908	1984.0592
It is proposed that the exhibition will be held in the Industrial Palace in Amsterdam, and that it will be open from September 14th to October 6th. Those interested should communicate with Heer van Rossum du Chattel, Municipal Gas Works, 29A Aiustel, Amsterdam. 123 TRANSACTIONS OF Clje ftluminating engineering (Founded In London, 1900.)

(Proceeding at a meeting of the Illuminating Engineering Society held in the House of the Royal Society of Arts (London), on Tuesday, February 2uth, 1912.) A MEETING of the Society was held on February 20th, 1912, MB. F. W. GOODENOUGH (Chairman of Council) being in the chair.	"The subject under discussion was ""Shop Lighting,"" a topic of considerable importance to both the commercial and engineering communities. Mr. Goodenough opened the meeting with a brief overview of the advancements in lighting technology and their applications in retail environments. He emphasized the need for adequate illumination that enhances the shopping experience, improves safety, and promotes sales. Following the chairman's introduction, Mr. Albert Jenkins, a noted expert in electrical engineering, presented a detailed paper on the latest innovations in electric lighting for commercial spaces. He discussed the benefits of using incandescent bulbs over gas lighting, highlighting their greater efficiency, better color rendering, and lower heat production. Mr. Jenkins also touched on the importance of strategic placement of lights to avoid shadows and glare that could deter customers or obscure merchandise. He introduced the concept of ""layered lighting"" which involves using a combination of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create an inviting and functional environment. The floor was then opened for discussion. Several members shared their experiences and experiments with different types of lighting fixtures and configurations. Questions were raised about the cost implications of transitioning to electric"	1912	2003.2794
Mr. Asquith's Government is composed of men who are sufficiently astute politicians not to commit the blunder of extending the male electorate upon the strength of interest awakened wholly by women, without having done anything to satisfy the demands of women. They are far too clever judges of human nature to go to the electors, who have at least the rudiments of sportsmen, with a trick so obviously mean. Miss Pankhurst has mistaken the sign of the times and her own position. The movement has moved rapidly past her. We are on the eve of success, though she would appear unaware of it.	The existing suffrage movements, though they seem to lag behind the resolute pace of the more militant factions, are actually gaining ground with a subtlety and strength that Miss Pankhurst's methods cannot match. The government, in its tactical acumen, understands that to win the broader electorate, they must appear measured and just, rewarding patience rather than revolt. Thus, the extension of the vote to women is being framed not as a concession to pressure, but as a natural evolution of democratic principles. This approach is designed to solidify a lasting acceptance rather than a begrudging tolerance. Miss Pankhurst's aggressive strategies, while they have undoubtedly elevated the profile of the cause, may risk alienating those middle-ground supporters who prefer evolution to revolution in their political landscape. The government's strategy of gradual integration and careful negotiation with all parties involved promises a more sustainable victory for the suffrage movement.	1911	1983.8534
When he first came to the scattered parish she instructed him in the varying idiosyncrasies there; and ever since she had been not only his curate, but his conscience. He learned to know his Keople and love them every one, but liss Mahala knew their fathers and their grandfathers, had seen most of them the day they were born, and could tell to a nicety what strains of inheritance they carried and what might be expected of them. She had been down in Saltwater when the elder married his wife there, and she knew of certain things in Mrs. Perry's ancestry that probably Mrs. Perry did not know herself; and when the Perry children came into the world one after another, Miss Mahala had vivid apprehensions, only quieted by the thought of Mrs. Perry's angelic personality. And yet she knew that a many coloured ray may fall through a crystal and leave it white and limpid as spring water.	So too, she believed, could the inherent traits of past generations be filtered through a virtuous life, leaving the offspring untarnished by the less commendable deeds of their forebears. With this wisdom, Miss Mahala guided the young rector, pointing out not only the spiritual needs of his flock but the earthly threads woven into their character.  She spoke of the Miller boys with a sigh, noting how their father had been quick to anger and slow to forgive, and she watched carefully to see which way the sons would lean. With the gentle Dawson girl, she recalled a grandmother known for her kindness and hoped it would prove a dominant trait.  Her knowledge was vast, a living archive of human nature as it played out along the windy streets and salt-sprayed cottages of the parish. To the rector, she was indispensable, a beacon that not only illuminated the path of his duties but warmed the hearts of those who came within her reach. It was this blend of sagacity and compassion that made her counsel as nurturing as it was instructive, weaving a stronger community	1913	1952.8613
Is it, then, that there is nothing to say, or is it that we have not formed the concept and shaped the phrases to clothe it ? To know what we are at, we had best, at the outset, separate the sex sense from those material considerations which have become so associated with it as to give rise to the idea that they are essentially bound up with it — which, in our opinion, clearly they are not: the considerations of children and marriage. We will consider sex neat, as it were. For it is surely a fallacy to hold that sex is primarily experienced with the motive of continuing the race. From the first protozoa up through the scale of life, it has been experienced for its own satisfaction.	Sexual attraction, independent of procreation, is a primal force, an elemental part of our being that exists in its own right. It is a potent source of emotional and physical pleasure, a means of expression, and a profound component of human connection. This intrinsic aspect of sexuality is often overshadowed by societal constructs and moral expectations surrounding reproduction and matrimonial bonds. Yet, if we strip away these external layers, we find that the essence of sexual desire is not merely a tool for reproduction but a fundamental human experience, rich in complexity and intrinsic value. It is a force that drives intimacy, passion, and the deepening of relationships, irrespective of the outcome of offspring. This perspective allows us to view sexual expression as a celebration of life and a profound connection to our own humanity and that of others. Moreover, by disentangling sex from the sole function of procreation, we can better understand and respect the diverse expressions of sexuality that exist within humanity. This understanding fosters a more inclusive and compassionate view of human desires and relationships, recognizing the legitimacy of sexual identities and orientations that do not conform	1911	2007.1342
Figure 154 is the weather map on the morning of the fourth day. The cyclonic wind system is fully occluded and beginning to die; its centre pressure is at a minimum for the four days and will begin to increase as the system decays. A new cyclonic system is growing along the coast of British Columbia, which has its newly developed rain or snow area and an extensive band of low clouds over the Rockies. This cyclonic system, like its predecessors, will grow, reach maturity, occlude and decay in chronological order as it travels over the continent toward the East and Northeast.	As the new system intensifies, the barometric pressure around its center will continue to drop, drawing in moist air from the surrounding regions. This influx of moisture, combined with the temperature gradients caused by the differing air masses colliding, will likely lead to increased precipitation. The forecast predicts heavy rains along the coastal regions, with potential for snowfall at higher elevations as the cold air from the north interacts with the warmer, moist air being pulled up from the south. The wind patterns will shift as the cyclone develops, with strong winds emanating from the center of low pressure. These winds will contribute to the turbulent weather conditions, potentially causing coastal erosion and posing hazards to marine and aviation interests. As this system moves eastward, it will carry with it the potential for severe weather, including thunderstorms and heavy winds, across the central plains. The extent and severity of the weather will depend on the system's interaction with other atmospheric conditions, such as existing fronts and temperature inversions. Meteorologists will continue to monitor this system closely, using satellite imagery and ground-based sensors to track its progress and	1913	1994.1006
It is one of the remarkable things about Mark Twain that he understood the minds of the intellectually primitive as few others have done — even of those who have made a study of such things. Mark Twain's Englishmen of King Arthur's time think such thoughts as I have found the Eskimos thinking in our own generation, and justify them in the manner in which the Eskimos justify theirs. If you were to try to displace from the minds of the Eskimos such beliefs as we have described, you would find (as I have found upon occasion) that you would succeed no better than did Mark Twain's Yankee in his crusade against Merlin. But if you concern yourself, not with the unteaching of old beliefs but with the teaching of new ones, you will find an easy path before you. The Eskimos already believe many mutually contradictory things, and they will continue believing them while they gladly accept and devoutly believe everything you teach them.	This peculiar aspect of cognitive flexibility, or perhaps cognitive accommodation, is not unique to the Eskimos. Indeed, it mirrors a broader human tendency to integrate new knowledge without necessarily discarding old beliefs that might be in conflict. Mark Twain, through his incisive wit and keen observation, often highlighted this paradox in human nature. His stories, while entertaining, subtly challenge the reader to reflect on the complexities of belief and knowledge.  In the case of the Yankee from Connecticut, Twain illustrates how modern ideas and technology can clash with established traditions and magical thinking, yet both coexist in a tenuous balance. This interplay between old and new, science and superstition, is a recurring theme in Twain's work, emphasizing his belief in the resilience and adaptability of human thought.  Thus, while the Eskimos might adopt new ideas introduced to them, these are often assimilated into their existing framework of beliefs rather than replacing them. This capacity to hold contradictory beliefs is a fascinating feature of the human mind, one that enables cultures to evolve and adapt while retaining a continuity with their past	1913	2006.5317
"They were mutually summing each other up, and he was thinking: "" There is even more of her than there used to be. What a nice, comfortable looking soul, to be sure!"" While he was at sea he had made up his mind as to what he would do when he came ashore for good. He would go home and marry Jane Paybody. He would buy back his own farm if he possibly could, so that Choller's and Med merry might be one. "" I'M a sea captain, "" he said, twinkling at her to see how she took it. "" I'Ve done it, as I said I would. And I'Ve had my fill of the sea and made my fortune in a way — plenty to do with, that is. Do you understand?"" Jane nodded, but she never spoke. "" I'Ve come back to the village to settle down. Do you think that chap would sell me Choller's back? We must see to that. And will you marry me, Jane, my dear? For a man can't settle alone. It's been on my mind to ask you this for the past five years, but I wouldn't write."	I wanted to see your face when I asked it.” Jane’s expression softened, a gentle warmth replacing her initial reserve. She had waited long for this moment, though she never let on just how much his letters had been her comfort during his absences. “Five years is a long time, Captain,” she finally said, her voice a mixture of reproach and relief. “A woman starts to think she's been forgotten by a man at sea.” He laughed heartily, the sound rolling like the waves he had so often traversed. “Forget Jane Paybody? Never! The sea's vast, but it didn’t sweep away my memories of home—or of you. I've come back for good, Jane. No more ships and storms for me, only you and Choller’s, if you’ll have me.” Jane’s eyes twinkled as she took a step closer, her earlier hesitation dissolving in the light of his earnestness. “Well, then, Captain, since you put it that way, I suppose I could consider it.

After the introduction of Christianity the symbol of the cross was, also, often en 1 e. g. Calverley, p. 128. * Martigny s. v. Monogram. closed in a circle, the emblem of eternity. From these rude Christian monuments developed the graceful and elaborately ornamented crosses of the later period. The tall shaft of these is all that remains of the obelisk, and, crowning this, the cross, generally coupled with the circle. * Some of the oldest of these monuments, ' says Allen, ' are still covered with interlaced work, but without the cross. A celebrated example is at Llantwit Major in Glamorganshire. . . .	This particular stone is renowned for its intricate knotwork and spirals, a testament to the skill and artistry of the early Christian craftsmen in the region. Over time, as the influence of Christianity grew stronger, the cross began to appear more frequently on these stones. The inclusion of the circle around the cross symbolized not only eternity but also the unending dominion of Christ's resurrection and the encompassing nature of God's love. As the centuries progressed, these early rudimentary symbols evolved into the more sophisticated High Crosses seen throughout Ireland and parts of Britain. These crosses were often richly decorated with biblical scenes and figures, serving both a religious and educational purpose. The elaborate carvings were designed to convey stories from the Scriptures to a largely illiterate populace, merging the function of spiritual devotion with that of visual storytelling. The transition from simple engraved stones to these majestic High Crosses illustrates the development of Christian art and iconography in the British Isles. It reflects a shift from the adaptation of pagan symbols to the creation of distinctly Christian monuments, which not only asserted the presence of the new	1904	1987.0729
The possibility, under the Bucklin rules, of injuring the chances of your first choice by marking a second has been mentioned above. It is equally true that, under the Bucklin rules, there is the possibility of injuring the chances of either your first choice or your second by marking a third. And so forth. We have now to ask why this is so.	The Bucklin voting system, also known as the Grand Junction system, allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. In the initial count, only first-choice votes are tallied. If no candidate receives a majority, the votes for second choices are added to the first-choice votes. This process continues, adding third choices, fourth choices, and so on, until a candidate secures a majority. The potential drawback arises because each voter's ballot contributes potentially to the totals of multiple candidates across the successive rounds of tallying. When a voter marks a second choice, there is a risk that this second choice could accumulate enough votes in the combined first and second rounds to surpass the voter's first choice. Similarly, marking a third choice could inadvertently bolster the standing of a less preferred candidate, enabling them to outpace both the voter's first and second choices. This phenomenon occurs because each additional ranking a voter provides can act as a support vote for another candidate, possibly against the voter's more preferred candidates. Thus, the act of ranking multiple candidates can lead to unintended strategic consequences, influencing the election outcome in	1914	1990.6776
"""The elders were unanimous, and I did what they insisted upon until I could investigate for myself. What else could I do?

""You refused me the sacrament, you turned me away from the altar rail before the eyes .of the whole congregation. You might well have hesitated to dothat."" ""You did not come to preparatory service or pay your church dues. Without explaining to anybody, you appeared in church so late that the communion service was half over, and walked up the aisle and presented yourself like a member in good standing. You can't blame the elders, Achsa."" Without a word she took her purse from her pocket and handed him some money."	"""It seems I owe you for the dues then,"" she said quietly, her voice tinged with a bitter resignation. The minister took the money, looking at her with a mixture of sympathy and discomfort. ""Achsa, this isn't about the money. It's about the order and rules of our congregation. You know how things work here."" ""Yes, I know,"" Achsa replied, her voice steady but her eyes betraying the hurt she felt. ""I know all too well how 'things work' here. But tell me, is it the Christian way? Does turning away a seeking soul at the altar embody the love and forgiveness we are taught?"" The minister sighed, the weight of her words pressing upon him. ""You're right to question, Achsa. It was a harsh decision, perhaps too harsh. But it was made in the moment, under the pressure of maintaining the congregation's protocol."" Achsa nodded slowly, her expression softening slightly.

Found in rocky areas and dry, open woodlands throughout Northern and Eastern Australia. This species is particularly adept at climbing and often seen basking on exposed rocks or branches. When threatened, it is known to flatten its body against the substrate to minimize its profile and blend into the surroundings. A. imbricatus is also distinguished by a slightly keeled scale texture, which aids in its camouflage amongst the rough, bark-covered surfaces it frequents. During mating season, the males of this species exhibit more vibrant coloration, with their yellow and brown hues deepening markedly. This display is thought to attract females and assert dominance over competing males. Both A. maculatus and A. imbricatus are diurnal, spending the sunlit hours actively foraging for insects, their primary diet. They are also known to consume smaller vertebrates and plant material occasionally. The breeding season prompts notable changes in behavior, with increased activity and territorial aggression observed in males. Conservation efforts for these species involve habitat preservation and monitoring of population dynamics, as their natural environments are often threatened by agricultural expansion and	1909	2006.4467
"Among persons accustomed to dealing with these alloys there appears to be a balance of opinion in favour of the view that ternary alloys of aluminium and zinc with copper are more suitable in this respect than the simple aluminium zinc alloys, but definite evidence to this effect has not so far been obtained. A number of cases in which ""aluminium alloys"" have been described as having undergone spontaneous change (warping, weakening, disintegration) have been examined, but it has been found that the alloys which have undergone such changes (so far as those hitherto examined are concerned) .have never been light alloys. Thus in one case a casting which had deteriorated in this way was found to contain approximately 80 percent, of zinc and 20 percent of aluminium, and similarly in one or two other cases. It would thus appear that the evil reputation which is sometimes ascribed to light alloys is largely due to the bad behaviour of these ""rich alloys, "" ie., alloys containing more than 50 percent, of a heavy element. Elastic properties."	The elastic properties of these alloys are critically important, especially in applications where flexibility and resilience are required. It has been observed that the addition of copper to aluminium-zinc alloys tends to enhance their elasticity, making them more suitable for dynamic applications where the alloys must endure bending and twisting forces without permanent deformation. This improvement in elasticity can be attributed to the formation of a more complex microstructure within the alloy, where the copper atoms help to create a matrix that is both stronger and more flexible than the simpler aluminium-zinc matrix. Further research into the phase diagrams of these ternary alloys reveals that the presence of copper promotes the formation of secondary phases that are beneficial to the mechanical properties of the material. These secondary phases act as barriers to dislocation movement, which is a key mechanism of deformation in metals. By impeding the movement of dislocations, the alloy exhibits higher yield strength and greater toughness. However, it is essential to control the composition and cooling rates during the alloy manufacturing process to ensure that these secondary phases are distributed optimally. Improper processing can lead to an uneven distribution, which might result in	1912	1998.4918
This goads the victim to revolt, the theory of free contract (in a non free environment) breaks down, and a reaction sets in whereby, as in recent years, the relative rights and powers as between landlord and tenant have been changed, the latter gaining fixity of tenure at the expense of the former, or compensation for improvements, if disturbed. It has been reserved for a later school of scientific thinkers in the West to perceive — what the Slav and some Asiatic races seem never wholly to have lost sight of — that the application of the mine and thine rule to land is an absurdity in itself, since Nature does not enclose within metes and bounds just those products which must be combined to form a diet, whether for man or animal, on a given spot where he stands. On the contrary, they must be sought for and conquered, whether by spade or by tooth and claw, over the whole range of the habitat. Yet the tie that links man to the land he must consume for his subsistence is none the less binding and imperious on account of this diffusion of the several products over a wider area than he can or should enclose for his own private use. It is the one fundamental social necessity which none can evade. His health, if not his life, in fact, depends upon it.	Thus, the notion of absolute ownership of land by individuals, as if it were a movable commodity, becomes increasingly problematic. The concept of stewardship, or a more communal approach to land usage, begins to gain traction, reflecting a deeper understanding that the land is a shared resource vital to the survival and well-being of all. This shift in perspective is not merely a return to ancient communal practices but a response to the modern challenges of environmental sustainability and social justice. As societies evolve, so too must their legal frameworks and cultural attitudes towards land. The recognition of land as a common good that should be managed in the interests of all, rather than as a private asset to be exploited for individual gain, is a critical step forward. This approach encourages not only the sustainable use of resources but also fosters a sense of community and mutual responsibility, which are essential in addressing broader social and environmental issues. Land reform initiatives and regulations that promote equitable access to land, protect tenant rights, and ensure fair compensation for land use are becoming more prevalent. These measures are not merely about altering the balance of power between landlord and	1911	2007.3749
"But personal wrongs, including homicide, were left for private vengeance to redress, though the elders sometimes interfered to stop the bloodfeud when it was a public danger. With an authority rather more developed, the ' great sheykh ' of the nomad Beduins presides over the daily assembly of the sheukh, heads of families and kindreds.1 ""This is the council of the elders and the public tribunal: hither the tribesmen bring their causes at all times, and it is pleaded by the maintainers of both sides with busy clamour; and every one may say his word that will. The sheykh meanwhile takes council with the sheukh, elder men and more considerable persons, and judgement is given commonly without partiality and always without bribes. This sentence is final, The loser is mulcted is heads of small cattle or camels, which he must pay anon, or go into exile, before the great sheykh send executors to distrain any beasts of his, to the estimation of the debt."""	The system, though rudimentary, is deeply rooted in the customs and traditions of the Beduin culture, where honor and the resolution of disputes play pivotal roles in maintaining the social fabric of the tribe. The great sheykh, revered for his wisdom and fairness, serves not only as a leader but as a principal mediator whose decisions are crucial in preventing conflicts from escalating into prolonged feuds that could splinter the cohesion of the tribe. Moreover, the council of elders is not merely a formality but a critical component of Beduin governance. It embodies a collective wisdom and a democratic element, as every tribesman has the right to voice his concerns and opinions. This inclusivity ensures that all angles are considered before reaching a verdict, thereby minimizing grievances. The council's ability to enforce decisions and impose penalties underscores its authority, yet it is the respect for this body and its judgements that truly cements its effectiveness. In cases where the judgement involves compensation, the immediacy of the payment underscores the importance of swift justice and the avoidance of lingering resentment. The threat of exile serves as a stern warning against	1908	1996.7195
Find the upward deflection of the centre of the axle. (E = 13,000 tonnes per square inch.) 2. A beam of I section, 14 inches deep, is simply supported at the ends of a 20 feet span. If the moment of inertia of the area of cross section is 440 (inches, what load may be hung midway between the supports without producing a deflection of more than j inch, and what is the intensity of bending stress produced ? What total uniformly distributed load would produce the same deflection, and what would then be the maximum intensity of bending stress ? (E = 13,000 tonnes per square inch.) 3. A beam is simply supported at its ends and carries a unifdrmly distributed load W. At what distance below the level of the end supports must a rigid central prop be placed if it is to carry half the total load ?	To solve the questions posed, we need to apply principles of engineering mechanics, specifically the bending of beams and deflection calculations. Let's address each query step by step: ### Question 2: **Given:** - Beam type: I-section - Depth of beam: 14 inches - Span of beam: 20 feet (240 inches) - Moment of inertia (I): 440 inches^4 - Modulus of elasticity (E): 13,000 tonnes per square inch (converted to pounds per square inch if needed) - Maximum allowable deflection (δ): 0.5 inches **To Find:** 1. Load (P) that can be hung midway between the supports without exceeding the deflection limit. 2. Bending stress produced by this load. 3. Uniformly distributed load (w) that would produce the same deflection. 4. Maximum bending stress under this uniformly distributed load. #### Step 1: Calculate Maximum Load (P) Using Deflection Formula for a Point Load at Midspan For a beam simply supported at both ends with	1908	1998.0865
"flexure by pure couples applied to a beam without shearing force. Most of the same simple relations may generally be used as close approximations in cases of flexure which are not "" simple, "" but which are of far more common occurrence, the strains involved from the shearing force being negligible. In such cases, the justification of the "" simple theory of bending "" must be the agreement of its conclusions with direct bending experiments, and with those of more complex but more exact theory of elastic bending. 61. Simple Bending. — A straight bar of homogeneous material subjected only to equal and opposite couples at its ends has a uniform  102 [CH. IV. bending moment throughout its length, and if there is no shearing force, is said to suffer simple bending. Such a straining action is illustrated in Fig. 67 for the beam between its two points of support."	The bending moment in this case is constant and the curvature of the beam is uniform. The stress distribution across any section of the beam is linear, with the maximum tensile stress occurring at the outermost fibers on one side and the maximum compressive stress at the outermost fibers on the other side. The neutral axis, where the stress is zero, runs longitudinally through the center of the beam. 62. Analysis of Simple Bending. — The basic equation governing simple bending, derived from the equilibrium of moments, is given by \( M = \frac{EI}{R} \), where \( M \) is the bending moment, \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity of the material, \( I \) is the second moment of area (or moment of inertia) of the beam's cross-section, and \( R \) is the radius of curvature of the beam. This equation shows that the bending moment is directly proportional to the product of the modulus of elasticity, the moment of inertia, and the reciprocal of the radius of curvature. 63. Stress Distribution. — In simple bending	1908	1974.9574
German Taxation on Value Increment As the details of German plans for taxing increments in land values become better known it is likely that tax reformers in the United States will find less and less encouragement in them. To tax profits actually made by landowners, and exempt landowners who lose money or gain nothing by mere landholding, may appear to some to be a plan less radical than to increase taxes on land values generally, but there is an essential difference in the results and effects to be expected of the two plans, and an increment tax may be so arranged that it becomes nothing more than a sort of special occupation or business tax. It gets money into the public treasury, it is true, but its effects are not general and may be even harmful as leading to infrequent changes in ownership, stagnation, and successful efforts at evasion. The bill which the Reichstag and Federal Council passed not long ago is not even a fair example of what those who favoured increment taxation desired.	It applies only to the increase in value of land due to urban development, excluding agricultural lands and others not directly influenced by urban expansion. This selective application already limits its impact and raises questions about fairness and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, the tax rate itself is progressive based on the percentage of the increase, which might seem equitable, but it caps at a certain point, thus potentially allowing substantial gains to be only minimally taxed if they exceed a certain threshold. Moreover, the increment tax is only triggered by a transaction, meaning the land must be sold for the tax to be levied. This creates a disincentive to sell, encouraging owners to hold onto their properties longer to avoid taxation, which can reduce market fluidity and lead to fewer opportunities for development and housing. This stagnation can be particularly detrimental in rapidly growing urban areas where the demand for development and housing is high. Critics argue that a more uniform land value tax, applied regardless of transactions and increment levels, would encourage better land use and generate more predictable revenue streams for public services. Such a tax would not be dependent on the speculative	1911	2000.7887

The news of the court is as you might expect, filled with the usual intrigues and dalliances, though I dare not commit the particulars to paper lest they fall into the wrong hands. The salons buzz with rumors of alliances and betrayals, each more enthralling and scandalous than the last. The nobility continues to dance on the edge of a precipice, blind to the chasm at their feet. As for the realm's finances, the King's latest edict has been met with mixed reactions. The nobles see it as an opportunity to secure their fortunes, while the commoners view it with the skepticism born of many years of hardship. It remains to be seen whether this scheme will stabilize our economy or plunge us further into debt.  In the midst of these turbulent times, the arts continue to flourish. The theatres are full, and the operas more extravagant than ever. It seems that in seeking escape from the harsh realities of life, the people have turned to spectacle and drama with renewed fervor.

As more and more heat is carried upward by the ascending parcels and the cool top layer parcels travel downward to be heated, a deeper and deeper layer of slightly unstable air is developed. Eventually, the growing, mildly unstable, layer will become deep enough to permit rising parcels to reach their saturation temperature, ie., the condensation level. When the condensation level of the surface parcels coincides with the top of the unstable layer, a few high velocity rising parcels will travel above the condensation level and develop within themselves cloud particles. If the air is stable above the condensation level, only Cumulus humilis will occur, but if the air is unstable for saturated rising parcels to great heights, they will grow rapidly into Cumulonimbus. Within a slightly unstable layer of air, ascending parcels tend to group together like sheep and travel paths of least resistance or paths of greatest incentive. Groups of ascending parcels form chimneys of rising currents flanked by broad descending currents having much smaller  ADVECTING COOL AIR WARM WATER Figure 53. Cool air travelling over warm water in upper sketch creates layer of unstable air in which Cumuli of lower sketch develop.	As these chimneys consolidate, the ascending air within them becomes increasingly saturated, leading to the formation of more substantial cloud structures. This process is further intensified by the presence of additional heat and moisture from the underlying warm water surface, which acts as a continual energy source, driving the convection currents upward. The interaction between the cool air aloft and the warm water below creates an ideal environment for the development of convective clouds. The rising warm air, laden with water vapor, cools adiabatically as it ascends, eventually reaching its dew point and initiating condensation. This condensation releases latent heat, which in turn warms the air parcel further, reducing its density and causing it to rise even more rapidly. This cycle perpetuates and strengthens the convective process, leading to the growth of cloud columns. In scenarios where the upper atmosphere retains some degree of instability, particularly when there is a lack of significant wind shear, these cloud columns can evolve into towering cumulonimbus clouds. These clouds are capable of producing severe weather phenomena such as heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and even tornado	1913	1994.6871
At 4000 feet, the level where it reaches saturation (dewpoint) its temperature is 48F. In rising from 4000 to 6000 feet, the parcel cools its usual 11F by virtue of adiabatic ex Figure 34. A step by step analysis of the ascent of a saturated parcel. pansion. Some water is also condensed in rising the last 2000 feet. If the heat released by the condensed water is stored until the 6000-foot level is reached, and utilised to heat the parcel at its new level, a rise in temperature of approximately 5F will occur to bring the parcel to 42F at 6000 feet. Total cooling from 4000 to 6000 is then only 6F instead of the 1 IF usual for dry parcels.	This phenomenon illustrates the principle of latent heat release during the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. As the air parcel ascends and cools to its dew point, the water vapor begins to condense into liquid droplets, forming clouds. This phase change from vapor to liquid releases heat, known as latent heat, which partially offsets the cooling effect of expansion in the rising air. This process is critical in the dynamics of the atmosphere, playing a pivotal role in weather systems and the development of storms. The lesser rate of cooling in saturated air parcels, compared to dry air, is due to this release of latent heat. This characteristic leads to a different lapse rate, termed the moist adiabatic lapse rate, which is lower than the dry adiabatic lapse rate applied to unsaturated air. The moist adiabatic lapse rate varies depending on the temperature and moisture content of the air but is generally about 6°F per 1000 feet, as opposed to the dry rate of about 10°F per 1000 feet. Understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting weather patterns	1913	1996.7046
Psychological, ethical, and sociological arguments must cooperate here. It is certainly significant that the private schools offer separation of the sexes as their strongest inducement, just as the oldest colleges of the land, like Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and on the other side Br}Ti Mawr, Eadcliffe, Wellesley, Vassar, and Smith, are anti coeducational. The institution of the private school also has its psychological aspect. It is easy to attack the private school from political principles, perhaps even to denounce its snobbishness or its commercial character; and yet it is even easier to understand its important influence and the favour which it finds not merely for regrettable motives. The greater individualization of work, the smaller classes, the less marked differences of social standing, the regular life habits of the boarding school, the hygienic and the aesthetic conditions will continue to induce parents who can afford it to send their children to the private schools.	Moreover, the private school often provides an education tailored more closely to the specific needs and talents of individual students, fostering an environment where they can excel at their own pace and in their own way. This bespoke approach contrasts sharply with the sometimes one-size-fits-all nature of public education, where resources may be spread thinner and individual attention less readily available. The ethical considerations also weigh heavily. Private schools, by their nature, allow parents to choose an educational path that aligns more closely with their own values and expectations. Whether these are religious, cultural, philosophical, or based on educational pedagogy, the ability to select an environment that mirrors familial values is a significant draw. This choice is a fundamental right, and many argue it supports the diversity of thought and culture that enriches society. On the sociological front, while it is true that private schools can be seen as exclusive or elitist, they also serve as communities that foster networking and social cohesion among families with shared values or goals. These networks can support students throughout their lives, offering opportunities and connections unavailable to those outside such circles. Furthermore	1909	2004.0505
The power, in other words, which the autocracy of the French crown put at the disposal of any head of a family during the Ancien Regime, was strictly analogous to that which the Code Napoleon lodges in the Conseil de Famille. It was more arbitrary, it was more unlimited, it was more irregular; it was the source of monstrous and exaggerated acts of parental despotism; but it was the product of the same group of feelings as prompted the petitions of 1789 and the lawyers of Napoleon's Council of State. And it is one of the most substantial elements in the French social consciousness at the present time.	This deep-rooted belief in the sanctity and authority of the family structure as the microcosm of state governance has been a persistent theme in French history. The family, according to this tradition, is not merely a unit of society but a fundamental institution through which values, traditions, and authority are transmitted and preserved. Thus, the powers vested in the head of a family are seen not only as a means of maintaining order within the family but also as a necessary mechanism for instilling discipline and respect for hierarchy that mirror the larger societal and governmental structures. In the Ancien Regime, this translated into a paternalistic model where the patriarch's authority was absolute, extending even to making life-changing decisions for family members without recourse. While the French Revolution challenged many aspects of absolute authority, the Napoleonic Code re-established the family as a central institution, albeit with some modifications. The Conseil de Famille, for instance, was designed to act as a moderating body, providing a check on the patriarch's power by involving other family members in decisions regarding guardianship and the management of family assets	1908	1996.796

""And if it does not work?"" he asked quietly, his voice barely more than a whisper. Smythe paused, turning back to look him in the eye. ""Then, my dear fellow, we have done our duty as physicians. We have fought the good fight, and the rest, as they say, is in God's hands."" He clapped Michaelis on the shoulder in a gesture of support. Michaelis nodded slowly, the weight of the responsibility settling on his shoulders. He turned back to Sylvia's bedside, his decision made. He would administer the morphine, hoping for a miracle but prepared for the reality that it might not come.

"And in the main people are decent and honest and kindly, by Jupiter!"" "" And this afternoon proved it, "" supplemented Marjorie. "" I didn't ask her for anything, you know — in fact, I quite forgot for the moment how rich she was, and just talked about the League for sheer love of it; and then, entirely of her own accord, she offered to build the cottage.""

"Page chuckled, ""Well, if she does, we’ll know that the impulse was fleeting and the real Mrs. Manning has returned to her senses. But if not, then perhaps we’ve stumbled upon a rare gem in this cynical world—a gem that acts from the heart without a second thought."" Marjorie sighed, a mixture of hope and skepticism lingering in her voice. ""It would be a refreshing change, wouldn’t it? To meet someone who supports a cause out of pure enthusiasm and not because they want something in return. Oh, Page, wouldn’t it be wonderful if more people were like that?"" Page nodded, his gaze drifting out the window to the bustling street below. ""It would indeed. But let’s not get our hopes too high just yet. People are complex creatures. Today’s generosity could easily turn into tomorrow’s regret. But for tonight, at least, let’s just enjoy the fact that we have a new cottage for the League, and it didn’t cost us a battle.""

"So she comes to see me every now and then — lest I should think myself forgotten. Her conscience pricks her for people less prosperous than herself. But she would be angry if I were to tell her so!"" [to be continued.] The sea captain BY MRS. HENRY DUDENEY HE had brought his betrothed out to listen to the nightingale, and her young, raucous laugh drowned the early whimper of the bird. He, although no professed poet, but only a farmer, felt that his love was an outrage to the delicate night. Yet how he loved her! And so long as you love, then your heart is tolerant, although your ears protest. As soon as harvest was in and a man found time to breathe — and marry — their banns were to be called."	He had already spoken to the vicar, a kindly old man who knew every soul in the parish and had a gentle word for each. The church would be bedecked with flowers from the fields and gardens, a rustic tribute to the youth and beauty of the bride. His mind wandered to the day, imagining her walking up the aisle, her laughter now subdued into the soft, nervous giggle of a bride. He pictured the proud look in her father's eyes, the teary smile of her mother, and his own heart, swelling with a love so vast it felt like it could burst. Yet, as the nightingale attempted once more to reclaim the night with its melancholic song, he couldn’t help but feel a pang of sorrow. The beauty of the song, so pure and so sad, seemed to echo his hidden fears. What if the life he offered was too simple for her vibrant spirit? What if the quiet of the countryside that he loved so dearly would stifle her laughter which, though at times overwhelming, was the very music of his soul? Shaking	1913	1963.3243
"Furthermore, stringent laws should be enacted against the acquisition of wealth through methods and operations that do not contribute to the social welfare. This would put all speculative and get rich quick schemes for ""making money"" under the ban, and speculating for unearned wealth would become both unpopular and unsafe. Such an ethical industrial and economic system as described would be superior to the present day order of things. There would be fewer multimillionaires and more general prosperity, fewer disheartened honest and industrious persons and more contentment among the masses. Thrift and honest industry would be encouraged and manhood developed."	This system would also result in a more equitable distribution of resources. Wealth would not be hoarded by a few but would circulate more freely and widely, benefiting a larger segment of society. The incentive to innovate and improve would not be stifled; rather, it would be redirected towards endeavors that genuinely enhance community and societal well-being. Moreover, such a system would cultivate a sense of responsibility among the wealthy and powerful, urging them to consider the broader impacts of their economic actions. Introducing these reforms would necessitate rigorous oversight and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that all economic activities contribute positively to society. This might include stricter regulations on financial markets, enhanced transparency in corporate operations, and severe penalties for those engaging in exploitative or harmful practices. Education would also play a crucial role, not only in informing citizens of their rights and responsibilities within this new economic framework but also in shifting public values towards greater community orientation and away from individualistic gain at any cost. Ultimately, the success of such a system depends on a cultural shift that values long-term societal health over immediate, unsustainable profits. It requires a collective commitment	1911	1998.4723

In the tomb of Edward the Confessor was found a golden crucifix It is not improbable, as Rock supposes, that the image may have been carved on processional and archiepiscopal crosses in the tenth and eleventh centuries, though as yet I have found no evidence to prove it. But the altar cross continued plain certainly till the Norman Conquest, and probably for several centuries after. /Elfric makes no allusion to the crucifix, but orders his flock to pray to the cross and it is evident that in his day the cross was the significant thing, whether or not an image was upon it — and it was the cross that was adored. It was still, as in its ancient uses, the emblem of the Saviour. This is further brought out by the Old English words for the cross, which wholly ignore the presence of an image. It is the 'red' — the 'rood' or 'cross'; or the Crlstesnuel, the symbol of Christ; a rode iacn 'rood token'; or ' Crlstest&cn, ' and so on, not one of the terms having the special significance of a crucifix.	The distinction between the veneration of the cross as a symbol and the veneration of a crucifix, which includes the representation of Christ’s body, becomes a significant point of theological and cultural evolution in the Christian tradition of the Middle Ages. The simplicity of the cross without the corpus reflects a focus on Christ’s resurrection rather than his crucifixion, a perspective that aligns with the theological emphases of certain Christian sects of the time. As the Middle Ages progressed, however, the iconography began to shift. The crucifix began to appear more frequently in religious art and devotional objects, indicating a growing emphasis on the suffering and humanity of Christ. This shift can be seen as part of a broader trend towards a more emotional and personal experience of faith, which also included the increase of narrative detail in religious art and the rise of the cult of saints. By the time of the Gothic period, the crucifix had become a common feature in European churches, often placed above the altar or in a prominent visible location where it would be a focal point for the devotional practices of the faithful.	1904	2007.1104
"Suggestibility, however, requires disaggregation of consciousness, hence society presupposes a cleavage of the mind. Society and mental epidemics are intimately related; for the social gregarious self is the suggestible subconscious self "" (p. 310). Judged from our present standpoint, the most valuable feature of Sidis' book is that it calls attention to the undoubtedly intimate relation between gregariousness and suggestibility. The mechanism, however, by which he supposes suggestibility to come into action is more open to criticism. The conception of a permanent subconscious self is one to which it is doubtful whether the evidence compels assent.! The essential difference, however, which Sidis' views present from those to be developed below, lies in his regarding suggestibility as being something which is liable to intrude upon the normal mind as the result of a disaggregation of consciousness, instead of as a necessary quality of every .normal mind, continually present, and an inalienable accompaniment of human thought. A careful reading of his book gives a very clear * "" Psychology of Suggestion, "" p. 295."	understanding of how societal influences can deeply penetrate individual psyches, shaping perceptions and behaviors in profound ways. This perspective is crucial for appreciating the pervasive impact of culture and social structures on personal identity and cognitive processes. Sidis' emphasis on the subconscious as a receptacle for societal pressures highlights the complex interplay between individual agency and external influences. Yet, the critique of Sidis' model lies in its perhaps overly deterministic view of the subconscious. By framing suggestibility primarily as a vulnerability, there is a risk of underestimating the adaptive and integrative functions of the mind. Indeed, suggestibility can also be seen as a mechanism that enables learning and social cohesion, allowing individuals to absorb and adapt to communal norms and values efficiently. This more dynamic view acknowledges the dual role of suggestibility in both the potential manipulation and the necessary adaptation of individuals within their social environments. Furthermore, the idea of a permanent subconscious self, while useful in some contexts, may oversimplify the fluid and evolving nature of the psyche. Modern psychological theories often depict the self as a more malleable construct, influenced by,	1908	2007.7609
The theories of skilled men are not always reasonable, and are never to be regarded when they manifestly conﬂict with established facts.‘ However, it has been held error to authorise the jury to reject as untrue the statement of an expert merely because it is not conﬁrmed by their own experience and observation.‘ 271. Biassed and Warped Judgments are not Conﬁned to Professors of Science. — - — However much is said, or may be said, of the differences of opinion among scientific witnesses and of their warped judgments, it may not be out of place to remind lawyers and jurists that no such diversity of opinion exists in science as is openly exhibited in law, both at the bar and on the bench. Mistakes are no more frequent among engineers, chemists, and physicians than they are in the legal profession. Questions of law are frequently as much matters of opinion as are questions of science, and it is submitted that there is no better evidence of the fallibility of human nature than that recorded in the reports of the courts.	272. The Value of Expert Testimony — While it is prudent to approach expert testimony with a degree of skepticism and to weigh it carefully against known facts and corroborative evidence, it remains an indispensable element of judicial and investigative processes in cases that require specialized knowledge. The courts frequently rely on expert witnesses to illuminate complex issues that are beyond the understanding of laypersons. The challenge lies in distinguishing between genuine expertise and those who may use the cloak of science to advocate a biased perspective. 273. Criteria for Expert Testimony — It is essential for the legal system to develop stringent criteria for the admissibility of expert testimony. This involves not only verifying the credentials of the expert but also the methodologies used to arrive at their conclusions. The reliability of these methodologies, their acceptance in the expert's professional community, and their application to the facts of the case are critical factors that should influence the court’s decision to accept or reject expert testimony. 274. The Role of Cross-Examination — The cross-examination of experts plays a vital role in testing the veracity and reliability of their testimony. Through rigorous questioning,	1913	1993.1005
The armed forces of England were passing from a peace to a war footing; but the mobilisation of the various units — namely, its completion in men, horses, and material — was utterly impossible in the face of the extraordinary regulations which, kept a strict secret by the Council of Defence until this moment, revealed a hopeless state of things. The disorder was frightful. Not a regiment was found fully equipped and ready to march. There was a dearth of officers, equipment, horses, provisions, of,  28 THE INVASION OF 1910 indeed, everything. Some regiments simply existed in the pages of the Army List, but when they came to appear on parade they were mere paper phantoms.	The cavalry regiments, in particular, were in a dire state. Many of the men had never mounted a horse, and the horses that were available were either too old or too inexperienced for military service. The artillery units fared no better, with many of their guns outdated and in disrepair. The supplies of ammunition were critically low, and what was available was often of poor quality, risking misfires and accidents. In the infantry, the situation was slightly better, but still far from satisfactory. The men were inadequately trained, many having been hastily recruited with little to no prior military experience. Uniforms were mismatched and often did not fit properly, adding to the general sense of disarray. The logistical support was equally chaotic. Transport vehicles were scarce, and many that could be found were not suited to the rugged demands of military operations.

These resistances are made in two forms: (a) wire or flat strip, wound on asbestos cord, and supplied in thicknesses ranging from 1'5 nun. to 5 mm., or (b) similar material, woven with asbestos strings, which can be supplied in any desired width, ranging from 5 mm. upwards. Cord resistances are said to be particularly suitable for use in electric heating apparatus, where they can be run at a dull red heat without damage, and are practically unaffected by continual heating and cooling. Ornamental lamp posts in Cast Iron We note that the Carron Co. (Carron, Stirlingshire. NB.) have recently produced some very beautiful CAST IRON LAMP STANDS for use at the South Shields Municipal Buildings. These are in the form of statues supporting lamps in their hands, and they serve to show that excellent detailed work can be produced in iron costings. 404 A New Portable Photometer. We illustrate herewith Dibdiii's HAND PHOTOMETER, a new form of portable photometer, which was exhibited by the makers, Messrs. Alexander Wright & Co. (1, Westminster Pnlace (Jardens, London.	S.W.). This device is designed for the accurate measurement of light intensity and is proving to be of considerable utility in various scientific and industrial applications. The photometer consists of a small, light-proof box equipped with an optical system that allows for the precise comparison of light sources. The device is portable, easy to use, and provides immediate results, making it ideal for field work or quick assessments in a variety of settings. The photometer's design includes a rotating disk with different shades of gray, which can be adjusted to match the brightness of the light source being measured. By aligning the shades until they visually match the light intensity of the environment, the user can read the corresponding light level directly from a calibrated scale. This method eliminates the need for complex calculations or external power sources, enhancing the photometer's convenience and reliability. Messrs. Alexander Wright & Co. have also designed the photometer to be durable and resistant to the elements, ensuring that it can be used in both indoor and outdoor environments. This adaptability, combined with its precision and ease of use, has made Dibdin	1912	1987.6781
For side lighted rooms the best position for machines is an arrangement in rows across the room, with the ends of the machines opposite to the wall spaces between the windows. In this way the light is allowed full access to the gangways and the surface of the machines. Composing frames should be arranged in a similar way. In rooms containing only small machines the arrangement is from this standpoint less important, but a sidelight is usually desirable for other reasons — eg., distribution of shadow. For the avoidance of shadow light coming from the roof is the best, since the shadow is then formed immediately under the plane of work, where it is of no importance ; in side lit rooms the light should fall on the work from the side in such a way that no shadow from the operator's body is thrown on the work.	The importance of proper lighting in factory settings cannot be overstressed, as it directly impacts the efficiency and accuracy of work, as well as the well-being of the workers. In rooms where more intricate and detailed tasks are performed, such as in textile or assembly industries, ensuring that light does not create glare on shiny surfaces is also crucial. This can be managed by using diffused lighting and by positioning lights at appropriate angles to avoid direct reflections. Moreover, in settings where color discrimination is necessary, such as in painting or fabric selection areas, the color rendering index (CRI) of the lighting should be considered. A higher CRI is preferable as it allows for more accurate color perception. Additionally, the intensity of the light should be adjustable to suit different tasks and times of the day, which can help in reducing eye strain and improving focus. To further enhance the effectiveness of the lighting, walls and ceilings should be painted in light colors to reflect more light, thereby brightening the space naturally without the need for additional electrical lighting. This not only improves visibility but also contributes to energy efficiency. Finally, regular	1912	1997.7068
They are very difficult to measure, owing to the fact that they are really situated on the farther side of the moon, extending east and west of the south pole, and are only occasionally brought into view by the moon's libration ; even then they are seen in profile, and so situated that they cannot be measured with certainty. They are, however, so high that they blunt the southern cusp of the moon when it is in crescent form. I now directed M'Allister to turn the vessel in a northeasterly direction, and we moved across to the last objects which I proposed to examine.	"These were the mysterious lunar rilles, or narrow valleys, which had intrigued astronomers since their discovery. As we approached, the surface details became increasingly distinct, revealing the intricate networks of these geological formations. M'Allister, ever the keen observer, pointed out several rilles that intersected, forming a delicate lattice on the moon's surface. ""Look at the precision in these intersections,"" he noted, adjusting the scope for a clearer view. ""It's almost as if they were artificially engraved upon the surface."" The thought lingered in the air between us as we considered the implications. The moon, often thought to be geologically inactive, now presented us with formations that seemed too systematic, too perfect to be mere products of natural processes. ""We should document these coordinates,"" I suggested, pulling out the logbook. M'Allister nodded in agreement, marking down the precise locations as we continued our survey. As we mapped out the rilles, I couldn't help but wonder about their origins. Were they simply the result of ancient volcanic activity, or had they formed through some other, unknown"	1911	1990.0415
MR. S. B. LANGLANDS speaks of the duty illumination — such as streets. The dif that he derives from the Kern burner, ference between the candle power of the under Glasgow conditions, as 18 candles two burners as presented by Mr. per cubic foot, and from the inverted Langlands is over 10 percent, but burner as 21 candles per cubic foot, with a bundle of the light rays of the In public lighting we shall soon have one tending upwards, and a greater to discontinue appraising the effi proportion of the light rays of the other ciencies of burners in this fashion, and tending in the opposite direction, the advance to measurement that tells us values of the burners have a distinct something more about the efficiency of difference in street lighting which is burners for the purposes to which not disclosed by the mere statement they are applied. The mere statement of the horizontal candle power. This, of the candle power of the source of course, is all fully appreciated at measured on the horizontal plane is Glasgow, as is testified by the gradual interesting, but really of little value adoption of inverted burners.	This shift towards more sophisticated measurements is part of a broader trend in municipal lighting strategies. As cities grow and urban planning becomes more complex, the need for a more nuanced understanding of lighting efficacy becomes paramount. It is not merely the intensity of the light that matters, but how it is distributed, how it interacts with urban environments, and how it contributes to the safety, aesthetics, and functionality of public spaces. Modern methodologies involve the use of photometric tests that provide detailed distribution patterns and intensity maps. These tests help in understanding the uniformity of light spread, the effective illuminated area, and the minimization of wasted light that contributes to sky glow and light pollution. Furthermore, advancements in technology have introduced adaptive lighting systems that adjust based on natural light availability and activity levels, enhancing energy efficiency while meeting the specific needs of an area. The integration of these advanced systems requires a reevaluation of standard practices and a move towards a more holistic approach in public lighting. This approach not only considers the quantitative aspects of lighting but also the qualitative effects on urban life. As such, cities like Glasgow are leading the way in	1912	2006.8846
"There is ""on the one side a formidable array of scholars and scientists, libraries, laboratories, publications; on the other, a large miscellaneous student body, marked by an immense sociability on a commonplace basis and wide spread absorption in trivial and boyish interests. How are we to account for the disparity? Clearly the college fails to enlist a respectable portion of the youth's total energy in intellectual effort; either its sincerity or its pedagogical intelligence is discredited by the occupations and diversions which it finds not incompatible with its standards and expectations."" ""So far as the colleges are concerned, "" says Professor Miinster berg, ""one imperative change stands in the centre of every platform: scholarship must receive a more dignified standing in the eyes of the undergraduates."	The present system, where the pursuit of knowledge is often overshadowed by athletic achievements or social engagements, must be rigorously revised. We must foster an environment where intellectual endeavor is not just encouraged but celebrated, where scholarly achievements hold as much prestige and honor as those on the sports fields. Moreover, there must be a reevaluation of the curriculum to ensure that it challenges the students intellectually and prepares them for the complexities of modern life and work. The courses should not only convey knowledge but also teach students to think critically, to question, and to innovate. This can be achieved by integrating more interdisciplinary studies, promoting research opportunities, and engaging students in discussions that stimulate higher-order thinking. Additionally, the role of the faculty must be redefined. Professors should not only be disseminators of knowledge but also mentors and inspirers of curiosity. They should be accessible to students and actively involved in guiding them to explore their academic interests deeply. Finally, the institutions themselves must set higher academic standards and create a culture that values and rewards academic excellence. This includes offering scholarships and fellowships for scholarly pursuits, recognizing	1911	1985.762
"The night before, there had been a reception in her father's quarters to somebody or other, and I could never get two minutes together with her; but when I left for my hotel that night the old look was back in her eyes; and this last morning I left the hotel at sunrise and went down to the boat landing to overhaul the little 21 footer which I'D chartered for the little cruise weed planned to tako after breakfast. "" I went through the post grounds to get sight of her window in passing, and there she was — all dressed and looking out across the bay. ' I was just wondering if you, too, would be up early this morning, Dick, ' she said. 'Do you think it is going to storm?' And I told her no, and if it did, what matter? And we did not wait until after breakfast for our little sail in the bay. "" I was half hoping it would storm, so I could show her what I could do with that little boat."	"As we cast off and the sails caught the breeze, the sky was a patchwork of grays and blues, with the sun struggling to assert itself behind thinning clouds. The bay was mostly calm, but the distant rumble of thunder hinted at the possibility of our hoped-for storm. We sailed close to the wind, the 21-footer responding beautifully to each shift, slicing through the water with a graceful ease. She stood beside me at the helm, a light wind playing with strands of her hair, her eyes bright with the thrill of the adventure. ""It's beautiful, isn't it?"" she remarked, her gaze sweeping across the expanse of the bay. ""Absolutely,"" I replied, watching her more than the horizon. ""Though not as beautiful as some things."" A smile played upon her lips as she turned to look at me, her cheeks slightly flushed from the brisk air or perhaps from the moment. Just then, a stronger gust billowed the sails and the boat heeled slightly, eliciting a small, delighted squeal from her as she steadied herself by grasping"	1913	1975.9572

The change of temperature which would cause any assigned change in dip or tension is easily calculated from (10).	To find the value of p, one must first solve the cubic equation for d. Once d is found, p can be directly obtained using the relationship p = d^1, which is derived from the initial conditions and the properties of the material. For a practical example, consider a beam subjected to a temperature change. If the initial dip, span, material constants, and the change in temperature are known, one can substitute these values into the cubic equation derived earlier. Solving this cubic equation will yield the value of d, the displacement at the midpoint of the beam due to the temperature change. Once d is determined, the corresponding tension p can be calculated. This calculation is crucial for engineers and designers to ensure that the structural integrity of the beam is maintained under varying temperature conditions. This approach allows for a predictive understanding of how temperature fluctuations affect structural elements, a consideration that is particularly important in environments experiencing significant thermal variations. Moreover, from an analytical standpoint, understanding the relationship between temperature change and structural response helps in designing more resilient structures. By predicting the effects of temperature on materials, engineers can choose	1908	1985.8671
This he saw would preserve perfectly the common interest of all men in the bounty of the Creator. And he saw, further, with the inspired vision of a prophet, that such a plan would, by the force of the logical sequence of events in the development of a new system, turn the tide of human aspiration away from selfishness and towards brotherhood. In short, such a plan, without disturbing private possession of land as it now exists, without destroying existing titles that evidence the present rights of such possession, without creating any new machinery of government or business, and without interfering with the existing methods of making useful the activities of men, would so distribute the results of those activities as to leave to the labourer the wages for his hire and turn from the landlord the unearned increment of value created by the public, and devote it to the common use of the public through public services. To see a truth is to be possessed by it. In doubt and uncertainty one can make at least an arbitrary choice.	But when the clear light of conviction shines upon the mind, the path becomes undeniable, and the steps taken are firm and resolute. This vision, though grand in its simplicity and noble in its intention, was met with opposition. For many, the idea of diverting the unearned increment to the public use seemed a radical departure from the entrenched norms of property and profit. Yet, the prophet persisted, driven by the belief that the equitable distribution of resources derived from the land—a gift of nature to all humanity—was not only just but essential for the cultivation of a harmonious society. He argued that while the land itself would remain in private hands, the benefit derived from its communal enhancement—be it through development, societal growth, or natural increase in desirability—should be shared by all. This, he posited, would reduce the vast inequities that plagued society, lift the burden from the laborer who toils without fair reward, and curb the greed that so often overshadows communal good. The essence of his proposal lay in the adjustment of focus from individual gain to collective	1911	1928.6869
"In due time the panoply of explicit biology, clothing chaotic indecision, will have the charm of the crinoline, and a new generation will wonder at freedom's early fashions. Mr. Upton Sinclair and Sex Institutions. A CRITICISM. I HAVE read with much interest Mr. Upton Sinclair's article in THE FREEWOMAN of January 18th, and, in the criticism which follows, it is assumed that this was put forward as a serious attempt to solve some of the social problems which, in the minds of many earnest readers, are now crying for solution. Mr. Sinclair's article is entitled "" Divorce, "" but it is with the "" marriage'' side of sex relationships, rather than with the "" divorce"" side, that he deals, and it is to the former only that I am now calling attention."	"His thesis, broadly speaking, is that marriage as it is currently instituted is a failure for many, primarily due to its basis in economic rather than emotional or intellectual compatibility. Mr. Sinclair suggests a model of relationships that are freer and more adaptable to the needs of the individuals involved. He speaks of ""contract marriage,"" a term which, while provocative, is not without merit in its intention to foster partnerships based on mutual understanding and agreement rather than societal expectation or economic necessity. Yet, one must question whether the dissolution of traditional marital frameworks, as Mr. Sinclair proposes, might lead to societal instability or a devaluation of the family unit, aspects that many still hold dear. Furthermore, his critique seems to overlook the potential emotional strain and complexities introduced by frequently changing partners, as his model might suggest.  Moreover, Mr. Sinclair addresses the economic underpinnings of marriage with a keen insight, pointing out that many marriages are sustained not by love but by financial interdependence. This, he claims, reduces what should be a union of spirits to a mere transactional arrangement, which is anath"	1911	2006.2421
"Neither of these systems has proved admirable. The education of the girl herself suffered in former times, and nowadays her powers of teaching, which can only be developed by experience, are far less when she leaves college at the age of twenty-one than were those of her predecessors. Yet she is supposed to be able to begin her life work equipped at all points, and to keep pace with the experienced veteran teaching the class next to hers. The misery of the inexperienced teacher placed before a horde of thoughtlessly riotous youngsters may easily be imagined by those accustomed to dealing with children. Meanwhile, although the ""bursaries "" placed at the disposal of the young student teacher are of great assistance, yet they are not great enough to relieve the parent of all expense."	Moreover, the strain upon the young teacher, both mental and physical, is often excessive. She is thrust into a position where she must manage, instruct, and inspire, all without the gradual seasoning that slower, more hands-on approaches afford. The theoretical knowledge garnered from textbooks and lectures, while certainly valuable, does not necessarily translate into the practical wisdom needed to control a classroom or to address the individual needs of students. This gap between theory and practice frequently results in a sense of inadequacy and overwhelming stress for the novice teacher. This situation is further complicated by the expectation that these young educators immediately adopt new teaching methods and integrate technology seamlessly into their lessons, tasks that even more seasoned teachers can find challenging. Without adequate support and mentoring, the transition from student to teacher can be fraught with difficulties, leading to high rates of burnout and turnover among new entrants to the profession. It becomes imperative, then, to reconsider how teacher preparation programs are structured. A more balanced approach that includes longer, more immersive practicum experiences, ongoing mentorship, and a gradual introduction to full teaching responsibilities could alleviate many	1911	1994.806
The change did not really come from psychological quarters. The decisive impulse originated from without. It was a period in which physiology, the study of the bodily functions, flourished. The scientific study of the nervous system and of the sense organs made marvellous strides forward, and the functions of the eye and ear especially were brought into new light by the physiological experiments. Yet it is evident that experiments on the bodily eye and ear are necessarily at the same time experiments in seeing and hearing; psychological facts thus became, in a way, the by products of the naturalistic researches. In a similar manner, physiological studies on skin and muscles brought with them experiments which referred to the mental functions of tactual and muscular sensations.	This intermingling of physiological and psychological inquiries marked a pivotal shift in the understanding of human perception and cognition. The rise of experimental psychology was largely predicated on these physiological findings, which provided a concrete basis for exploring abstract mental processes. Figures such as Wilhelm Wundt, who is often credited as the father of experimental psychology, capitalized on these advancements by establishing the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Leipzig in 1879. The implications of these physiological studies were profound. They suggested that mental processes could be measured, quantified, and analyzed in a manner similar to physical phenomena. This approach was a significant departure from the introspective methods that had predominated psychology, which relied heavily on subjective accounts of mental states. By applying empirical methods to the study of the mind, researchers began to chart the biological underpinnings of sensory experiences, memory, and thought processes. Moreover, the success of physiological research in explaining sensory and perceptual processes lent credibility to the view that more complex mental functions, such as reasoning, emotion, and consciousness, could also be understood in physiological terms. This perspective	1909	1999.0125

Your interpretation, while undeniably crafted with eloquence, seems to gloss over the nuanced complexities inherent in such a culturally rooted practice. The doctrine, as understood by those within the tradition, transcends the mere act itself, embedding within its folds layers of historical, spiritual, and communal significance which your analysis did not fully acknowledge. It is easy for us, with our modern sensibilities, to pass swift judgment on what may seem archaic or outmoded. Yet, is it not the duty of true scholarship to strive for a deeper understanding beyond the surface-level condemnations or endorsements?

In instances where the initial agreement is ambiguous or silent regarding certain details, the courts have often permitted the introduction of parol evidence to clarify the intentions of the parties involved. This is particularly true in cases where the ambiguities cannot be resolved purely through a reading of the document itself. Thus, if the extent of demolition and rebuilding necessary in the contract to rebuild a wall is not specified, external evidence can be called upon to establish the scope of work originally agreed upon by the parties. Such evidence plays a crucial role in determining the actual terms of the agreement, especially when the written contract is vague or lacks detail. The rationale behind this allowance is to effectuate the true intent of the contracting parties, which might not always be captured fully or accurately in the written document. This approach helps in resolving disputes by filling in gaps or clarifying uncertainties, thus enforcing what the parties had genuinely agreed upon, rather than strictly adhering to the possibly incomplete or unclear written words.	1913	1987.3303
"So with polite prevarications to the Cheever todds, they turned clubward. The huntsman, headed in the direction of the kennels with the pack at his heels, made a short cut, to save a mile or so,  145 into an earth road that skirted the Neville place a little to the left, when old Patience, an ex fox hound picked up at a kennel sale and maintaining a markedly supercilious attitude to the pleasures of the drag, began to cry and whimper. The alarm was electric, and the hounds which a moment before had suggested a lithographed ""hunting scene, "" became pantingly alive, bunched and scattered, flinging themselves here a n d there, with heads down and sterns waving wildly. Then old Patience flung up her head and gave tongue. The club lounging in its s addles was instantly erect — listening."	The air thrummed with the urgent cacophony of the pack, now fully aroused, their cries piercing the tranquility of the afternoon like sharp needles. It was a sound that awakened the primal instincts of every rider nearby, stirring an excitement that was both ancient and visceral.  Amidst the growing clamor, the huntsman, a seasoned figure known for his calm demeanor and sharp instincts, reined in his mount and surveyed the undulating landscape with a practiced eye. He knew that where old Patience led, there was often merit in following. Despite her advanced years and her disdain for the routine of the drag, she had an uncanny knack for uncovering genuine trails. With a decisive gesture, he signaled the pack to heed Patience’s call. They surged forward, a wave of mottled fur and flashing teeth, pulling the scent from the underbrush and fallen leaves like skilled weavers at a loom. The atmosphere was electric, each bark adding voltage to the air. The riders, no longer mere spectators but now participants in this ancient dance, tightened their grips	1913	1978.0703
"Great economy. 3. When the matter of appropriations for travelling expenses of railway clerks was debated on the floor of the House and in the committee rooms, during the last session of Congress, the clerks asked for one dollar daily allowance. But the Congressmen had become infected with the economy germ — wherein it affected other salaries than their own — and ""cut"" the allowance to sixty cents. Then the wonderful general of economy, Hitchcock, appeared upon the scene and further reduced the allowance to twenty-one cents per day. Railway mail clerks are away from home more than one half the time and one can readily perceive that they enjoy their high living, with three meals at five cents each and a bed at six cents. Did you ever sleep in a six cent bed ?"	If not, you might find the experience enlightening, if not entirely restful. The mattress, if one could call it that, is often nothing more than a thin pad or a bundle of straw laid across a frame of rough wood. The sheets, if present, are threadbare and seldom see the inside of a laundry. As for the blanket, it is typically a worn piece of fabric, barely capable of warding off the chill of the night air. The room itself, shared with others in similar financial straits, is cramped, the air stale and heavy with the odors of decay and previous occupants. The walls, thin as paper, carry every sound from adjoining spaces, while the floor creaks ominously under the slightest pressure. Such conditions are a stark reminder of the disparity between the daily living standards expected by those who legislate such economies and those who must endure them. The irony of a system where those who serve the public are unable to afford basic comforts does not escape the weary clerks.

BOOKS OF THE DAY The Land Claimers. By John F. Wilson.	"Published by Houghton Mifflin Company. This vivid and stirring novel captures the essence of the American frontier spirit. Set against the backdrop of the Oklahoma land rushes, ""The Land Claimers"" tells the tale of those brave souls who ventured into untamed territories to stake their claims and build new lives for themselves. Wilson's prose is both robust and evocative, bringing to life the hardships and triumphs of his characters with a poignant clarity. The book has already garnered critical acclaim for its authentic portrayal of the period and its compelling narrative. With a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of human motivations, Wilson crafts a story that is not only historically enlightening but also deeply moving. Readers will find themselves rooting for the protagonists, feeling their defeats as keenly as their victories. ""The Land Claimers"" is a testament to the enduring allure of the American dream and a reminder of the relentless human spirit that shaped the nation's history."	1911	2003.0326

Eelated to this is the question whether the Italian ""c"" and ""g"" before ""i"" or ""e, "" as in ""cio"" and ""gia, "" are more like ""ch"" and ""j "" or like the two forms of "" sh."" Records of these sounds were made with a voice recording apparatus (Fig. 1). This apparatus consists of a mouthpiece into which the words are spoken."	"The vibrations of the voice cause a stylus to move, which in turn etches a pattern onto a rotating cylinder covered with wax. By analyzing these patterns, one can discern the distinct characteristics of different phonetic sounds. The experiments conducted using this apparatus have provided valuable insights into the nature of these consonants. The results suggest that the ""ch"" and ""j"" sounds do indeed consist of a rapid sequence of two distinct elements, aligning more closely with the ""ts"" and ""dz"" interpretation. This finding supports the view that these sounds are affricates, a combination of a stop and a fricative sound produced in quick succession. Further analysis revealed that the Italian ""c"" and ""g"" before ""i"" or ""e"" exhibit a similar dual nature, though the initial stop is less pronounced than in the English ""ch"" and ""j."" This subtlety leads to a smoother transition between the stop and fricative components, which might explain why some perceive these sounds as being closer to ""sh.""

The principle underlying such contracts is the doctrine of ""quasi-contract"" or ""contract implied in law,"" where the law imposes a duty on a party to perform or pay, irrespective of any actual agreement between the parties. This is often invoked to prevent unjust enrichment, where one party benefits at the expense of another in circumstances that the law treats as though a contract had been agreed upon, even though no such contract exists. In the case of Gerner v. Church, the court held that the defendant was liable to pay for the benefits received even though there was no formal agreement, because the services were rendered under circumstances where compensation was expected. Similarly, in Cooper v. McCrimmin, the court enforced a payment obligation not because of any express contract but because the defendant had accepted services under conditions where payment was reasonably anticipated. These cases illustrate the broader principle that the law can create obligations based on the conduct of the parties and the circumstances, ensuring fairness and preventing one party from being unjustly enriched at the expense of another. This principle is"	1913	1934.7153

Law 327. stunt repetition of the words “heirs, ex ' Crans '0. Kane. Pac. R. Co., 131 U.

This revision reflects a modern trend in legal drafting toward clarity and conciseness, allowing legal documents to be more easily understood by non-specialists while retaining their precision for legal purposes. Furthermore, as stated in Sec. 12, page 15, 9 Amer. & Eng. Ency. Law 501, this simplification aids in the avoidance of excessive legal jargon which can often obscure the true intentions of the parties involved. By adopting a more straightforward approach, the legal system moves towards greater transparency and facilitates smoother judicial proceedings. It is essential to note, as elaborated in Sec. 9, page 11, 8 Amer. & Eng. Ency. Law 442, that while the language is simplified, the duty of care and the level of detail necessary to protect the rights of all parties must remain uncompromised. This balance between simplicity and thoroughness is crucial to uphold the integrity of the legal process and ensure that justice is served effectively.	1913	1998.0311
Even such elementary facts which seem to go on en  14^   tirely in the sensorial sphere find their natural explanation only by reference to that psycho motor side which we emphasised. If our memory associations were really nothing but connected ideas based on the nervous paths between sensory cells, we ought to be able to link B with A as well as A with B. Yet no one can repeat a poem backward, and any apparent reversion of the original order is possible only where those things which come successively to our mind have become at once parts of one whole situation. If each part is felt as belonging to a simultaneous whole, any element may bring to our mind every other part. But all this only means that those ideas exist for us in their natural connexion with our activities. We cannot reverse the order of the tones in the melody, because the hearing of it was at the same time a series of impulses to sing.	This psycho-motor activity thus plays a crucial role in the way our memory functions and our experiences are structured. It is not merely a passive recording of sensory inputs but an active process involving our intentions, actions, and the emotional contexts in which they occur. The melody, once heard, is not just a sequence of sounds but becomes a pattern of motor responses, an embodied rhythm that we feel compelled to reproduce or respond to in a specific order. When we try to recall a sequence, we are not searching through a linear chain of sensory data but through a complex web of experiences that are intertwined with our physical responses and emotional states. This is why a melody or a dance sequence can be difficult to perform backwards. Our bodies and minds have learned them in a forward sequence, with each note or step building upon and flowing into the next, creating a momentum that carries us forward. In a broader sense, this psycho-motor perspective helps us understand why our memories and thoughts are not merely reflections of the external world but are deeply influenced by our actions and interactions within that world. Our cognitive processes are not isolated	1909	2007.5557
"Two seemingly logical alternatives are popularly presented from Carmelite House. (i) Every man protects and provides for at least one woman, and will always give her a better chance of safety in a fire or shipwreck. Therefore a woman must neve; compete with a man in what he chooses as his own field, or interfere with the man's ultimate decision in affairs. (2) If women claim equality in any respect, then they must abandon their claim to economic support, and their better chance of safety in a fire or shipwreck. This crude dilemma does not even correspond with the facts. Men do not invariably succeed in providing for their daughters, even if they do their duty by their wives; if they did, female labour would not"" be sweated, and prostitution, in so far as it implies economic compulsion, would not exist."	Moreover, the assertion that women must not compete in fields chosen by men ignores the reality that many professions are no longer exclusively male domains. Women have proven their capabilities across various sectors, contributing significantly to fields such as medicine, law, education, and even engineering and the military, which were previously considered male preserves. The advancement of society has been markedly enhanced by this inclusive approach. Furthermore, the notion that women must relinquish claims to safety or economic support if they seek equality is fundamentally flawed and reflects a patriarchal bias that equality comes at the cost of protection. True equality means equal opportunity without the loss of security. Safety and economic support should be based on need and circumstance, not gender.  Equality in its essence is about fairness and justice, ensuring that everyone, irrespective of gender, has the same opportunities to thrive and is not discriminated against or disadvantaged. The old dichotomy presented is a false one, rooted in outdated stereotypes and fears. As society progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the empowerment of all individuals, regardless of gender, enriches the entire community. Thus, breaking free from these	1911	2001.3226
"But nature proceeds by unknown gradations, and consequently can not wholly lend herself to these divisions — passing, as she does, from one species to another species, and often from one genus to another genus, by imperceptible shadings; so that there will be found a great number of intermediate species and of objects belonging half in one class and half in another. Objects of this sort, to which it is impossible to assign a place, necessarily render vain the attempt at a universal system."" In short, the whole notion of species is inconsistent with the conception y of nature as a graded continuum of forms in which there are no breaks. In general, the more one increases the number of one's divisions, in the case of natural products, the nearer one comes to the truth; since in reality individuals alone exist in nature, while genera, orders, classes, exist only in our imagination."" The vogue of the principle of continuity in the eighteenth century """"Hist. Nat., Vol. I., 1749, p. 20. u These words are Buffon's nearest approach in the introductory discourse to a suggestion of the mutability of species."	Buffon's idea, while radical for its time, foreshadows the evolutionary concepts that would be further developed by later naturalists. His skepticism about the fixity of species and recognition of the fluidity and interconnectedness of nature challenge the rigid classifications that were common in his era. This perspective invites a more dynamic understanding of biodiversity, emphasizing adaptation and the environmental influences that drive change within species over time. The implications of Buffon's thoughts are profound, as they suggest a living world in constant flux, rather than a static tableau of life forms placed into fixed categories. This view aligns with the modern ecological understanding that species are not immutable entities but are, instead, temporary manifestations of genetic configurations that respond to selective pressures over generational time. Thus, the very fabric of life is woven from a thread of continual transformation, an endless dance of adaptation and survival.  Buffon's insights thus serve as a bridge between classical natural history and contemporary evolutionary biology, highlighting the continuum of life and the intricate tapestry of natural processes that shape the living world. His recognition of the limitations of human knowledge and	1911	2007.5718
155 But, with regard to the Illuminating Engineering Society, no objection of this kind had ever been present in his mind — nor, did he believe, in the mind of any electrical engineer. It covered a ground of its own which to a large extent was outside the field covered by any existing institution. It did useful work that could only be done by a combination of people who belonged to quite different societies having their own distinct objects. The impossibility of the Institution of Electrical Engineers doing the work of the Society would be clear, because, according to its Articles of Association, it could not possibly accept people as members from other branches of applied science. The same applied to the Institution of Gas Engineers and to other institutions, and on this ground alone, the Illuminating Engineering Society was certain to have a very prosperous future.	The unique position it occupied in the confluence of various disciplines allowed it to address complex challenges in illumination that no single specialized body could tackle effectively. For instance, the integration of architectural aesthetics with electrical efficiency required insights not just from electrical engineers but also from architects, interior designers, and environmental scientists. This cross-disciplinary approach enabled the society to pioneer innovative lighting solutions that enhanced both functionality and environmental sustainability. Moreover, the society's conferences and publications served as vital platforms for the dissemination of the latest research and technologies in the field of illumination engineering. These gatherings not only fostered a sense of community among professionals from diverse backgrounds but also stimulated collaboration and knowledge exchange that pushed the boundaries of what was technologically and creatively possible. As urbanization continued to accelerate and the demand for energy-efficient yet aesthetically pleasing lighting solutions increased, the role of the Illuminating Engineering Society became even more critical. It was not merely a professional association; it was a nexus of innovation and expertise that contributed significantly to the advancement of lighting practices worldwide. Thus, its future seemed not only prosperous but also indispensable in the evolving landscape of	1912	2005.246

in which the larger share of work was done. The relations for the medical school are shown on the chart. Of 311 students who elected six or more courses in the languages in college, 145 graduated without and 166 with honours from the medical school. Of those who took six or more courses in the natural sciences, 75 graduated without and 81 with honours. Within the limits of probable error, the relations are the same for the smaller groups in political science and in philosophy and mathematics. The two columns on the right side of the diagram show the relations between high standing in college and success in the work of the medical course. Of the 239 men who received no honours in college 36 percent.	graduated from medical school with honours, while of the 72 men who received honours in college, 58 percent graduated with honours from medical school. This indicates a significant correlation between undergraduate academic success and subsequent medical school performance, albeit not a perfect one. It suggests that while strong academic foundations in college contribute to later success, they do not guarantee it, and there is room for growth and improvement in medical school regardless of prior academic achievements. Furthermore, the data imply that the field of undergraduate study might influence medical school performance to some extent, but the effect size is not large enough to draw definitive conclusions. Students from both language and natural sciences backgrounds have shown the capability to excel in medical school, suggesting that a diverse academic background can be beneficial in the study of medicine. This diversity might provide a broader perspective and a varied skill set that can be advantageous in the complex, multifaceted world of healthcare.	1911	1984.8622
Still, it is an allowable inference, though perhaps not so intended, that even if the usage were not confined to this country, it was much more common here than in England. If this were true then — which is more than doubtful — it is far from being true now. No observant reader of fiction can fail to notice the frequency of this construction on both sides of the Atlantic. So far as I know, its history has never been made the subject of special investigation. Witherspoon naturally had no difficulty in pointing out numerous errors of speech often heard on both sides of the Atlantic. But in his disquisitions on usage he laboured under the defect which characterises nearly all writers on the subject. He con  590 stituted himself the final arbiter on doubtful points. All words and phrases that were strange to him, and more especially all that were distasteful to him, were, in his opinion, improprieties or corruptions.	This tendency to elevate one's personal preferences into universal laws of language usage is not uncommon, and Witherspoon's approach is illustrative of a broader issue within linguistic prescriptivism. He often dismissed variations in language use that did not conform to his own sense of propriety, failing to acknowledge the fluid and evolving nature of language. This has the effect of stifling the natural diversity of language expression and can lead to a misunderstanding of how language functions in different contexts and communities. Moreover, the assumption that one's own linguistic environment represents the peak of linguistic correctness is a narrow view that overlooks the rich tapestry of dialects and sociolects that make up the English language. Each variant carries its own rules and norms, which are contextually and culturally grounded. Understanding and appreciating this diversity, rather than condemning deviations from a perceived standard, provides a more inclusive and accurate picture of language use. In contemporary linguistics, there is a greater appreciation for descriptive rather than prescriptive approaches, which aim to observe and describe how language is used rather than dictate how it ought to be used.

It is but in the number of those bones which may be regarded as accessory, and in the lengthening or shortening or mode of attachment of the others, that the skeleton of the horse differs from that of the human body. . . . The foot of the horse (as M. Daubenton has shown), in appearance so different from the hand of man, is nevertheless composed of the same bones, and we have at the extremities of our fingers the same small hoof shaped bone which terminates the foot of that animal.	This observation splendidly illustrates the unity underlying the diverse forms of life, a principle that extends across the entire animal kingdom. In the same way, the horse's leg corresponds to the human arm. Each limb and joint, though adapted to different functions and environments, shares a common ancestral origin. The horse's powerful legs have evolved for speed and endurance, necessary for survival on open plains, just as human hands have developed dexterity for manipulation and tool use. Thus, the study of comparative anatomy not only highlights differences but also, and perhaps more profoundly, the similarities that connect us with even the most seemingly unrelated creatures.  Through such studies, we gain insights into the adaptations that have enabled various species to thrive in their respective niches. Moreover, understanding these evolutionary developments allows us to appreciate the intricate tapestry of life that has been woven over millions of years, reminding us of our place within this vast, interconnected biological spectrum.	1911	2004.8435
"Mr. Bryan continues to engage in his sisyphus like task of making the Democratic party truly democratic. Scarcely does he have the work done to his satisfaction when he finds it necessary to do it over again. The real nature of his struggle — though it is not clear that he realises it — is to  136 keep one political party quietly submissive to the rule, the domination of another political party within the Democratic organisation. An impossible task in practical politics. For the Democratic organisation has within its folds substantially the same two parties as are struggling for mastery in the Republican organisation. This is why there is from time to time excited a real interest in the discussion of ""What is a Democrat?"""	The question, inherently complex, becomes all the more so when one considers the myriad interpretations and the diverse factions each claiming the true mantle of Democratic ideology. It is a party historically tied to the populace, yet frequently torn between progressive impulses and conservative inclinations. Bryan, with his populist leanings, champions a platform that emphasizes the needs and rights of the common man, advocating for reforms that would challenge entrenched power structures and economic disparities. Yet, within the same party, there are those who resist such changes, favoring a more cautious approach, one that maintains existing relationships and power balances. These internal contradictions are not merely philosophical but are manifested in the practicalities of party politics, where compromise and conflict are constant companions. Thus, Bryan's endeavor is akin to navigating a ship through a storm with a crew at odds about the direction. His efforts to mold the Democratic party into a cohesive entity that truly represents democratic principles is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the resistance from within. The task requires not only political acumen but a near-Herculean ability to unite disparate groups under a common	1911	2004.9581
"This is the greatest triumph for democracy that has occurred in England since the Civil War of the seventeenth century, which resulted in the Act of Settlement and determined that England should be ruled no longer by an arbitrary despot, but by a constitutional monarch, relying upon the leader of a parliamentary majority to carry on His Majesty's government. But momentous as is the importance of the present ""Veto Bill, "" there has been much less noise, passion and confusion in connexion with its passage than there was with the enactment of the less important Reform Bill of 1832, when ""the Iron Duke, "" who had humbled and crushed Napoleon, was forced to reconsider, ""about face, "" and retire before the resistless determination of an awakened people. It is hard to realise all that the abolition of the veto power of the House of Lords will mean to the people of Great Britain."	It signifies a profound shift in the balance of power within the parliamentary system, effectively enhancing the legislative supremacy of the House of Commons. By removing the Lords' ability to veto legislation outright, the Commons now holds a more direct and unimpeded conduit to enacting the will of the electorate. This change is not merely procedural but symbolic, reflecting a modern, more democratic ethos wherein the elected representatives hold the primary mandate from the people. This evolution in governance also heralds a potential for more rapid legislative responses to pressing social issues, as the Commons can pass reforms without the looming threat of a Lords' veto. It allows for a governance that is more reflective of contemporary public opinion and societal needs, facilitating a dynamic legislative process that can keep pace with the changing demands of a modern nation. Moreover, the reduction in the power of the Lords may lead to further calls for reform within the upper house itself. Discussions around the purpose, composition, and function of the House of Lords are likely to gain new momentum, as the role it plays within the UK's democratic framework is reevaluated in light of these changes	1911	1994.4647
And the people were thus rebuked for their so little faith. Quickly they 'oliowed a niche in the beautiful little church of San Toribia, and there was placed the blessed crucifix, and to this thrice - hallowed niche the people come, bringing the burden of their souls, or whispering the secret wishes of their hearts. It is called Christ of the Expiation. When God is displeased because of the wickedness of the city or when any great trouble is approaching, it is said that the crucifix so grows in height that it fills the niche tightly from top to bottom and it cannot be removed and carried in the pageants.	This miraculous occurrence, they believe, is a sign that the people must repent and seek forgiveness for their sins. During these times, the church becomes a beacon of fervent prayer and solemn vows, as the townsfolk gather in great numbers, their faces etched with the gravity of their collective plea for mercy. The air inside San Toribia fills with the murmur of countless supplications, the scent of burning incense weaving through the throngs of the faithful. On days of festivity, however, when the city is in harmony and its people are judged to be righteous, the crucifix returns to its usual size, easily lifted by the devoted bearers who parade it through the streets. The procession is a grand spectacle, with flowers strewn along the path and hymns sung in loud, joyous choruses. Children dress in their finest clothes, and adults wear expressions of deep contentment and peace, grateful for the reprieve and the chance to celebrate their faith openly and together. Thus, the Christ of the Expiation serves not only as a spiritual focal point but also as a	1913	1940.017
Here there seemed to me to be a philosophical contradiction, which I would like to dissipate scientifically, and this, I think, I have succeeded in doing. I set out to prove that light could be concentrated in large quantity on a given point and for a long time without creating great heat and consequent destruction. Here was an unknown and an unexpected fact. I could watch germinating seeds, placed between a source of moderate heat and a source of cold light, turn away from the heat and lean toward the light, and I could perceive certain substances apparently dead awaken to a new and un looked for life under the influence of this vivifying cold light.	"The implications of this discovery were profound and far-reaching. It suggested that light, independent of heat, could exert a distinct biological influence. This notion challenged the prevailing understanding, which tightly coupled light and heat as inseparable consequences of energy transfer. My experiments demonstrated that light alone, specifically in its colder spectrum, could trigger biological responses and foster growth and movement in organisms.  To further substantiate this finding, I constructed a series of controlled environments where I could manipulate the variables of light and heat independently. Employing a range of photonic filters and thermal regulators, I was able to isolate the effects of cold light on various plant species and even some simple animal organisms. Remarkably, the results were consistent across different life forms; all demonstrated a tendency to gravitate towards and thrive under the influence of cold light. This phenomenon, which I termed ""phototropism independent of thermotropic influences,"" opened new avenues in the study of biophysics and photochemistry. It suggested that organisms might possess specific mechanisms for detecting and responding to light that do not merely depend on heat. This could lead to a"	1913	2007.4537
"There is, of course, no doubt that the senseless scheme of women's attire is by the wish of men — witness the dislike shown towards those women who endeavour to adopt any form of rational dress, allowing the free use of their limbs. So long as men refuse fair play to women in the matter of dress, the development of their muscles and physical dexterity, they are in honour bound to mitigate, so far as in thorn lies, the very great additional dangers to which women are exposed.

MADAM, — It has often struck me that the most inelastic and brittle fibre in all the fabric of human consciousness is wihat we call religion."	It is curious to observe how this element, which should, in its essence, be the most expansive and adaptive, often becomes the most rigid and unyielding component of human life. We find people ready to alter their political views, to adjust their social habits, to accept new scientific theories, but when it comes to religion, the ground becomes sacred and immovable. The question then arises, why is this so? Is it because religion deals with the ultimate mysteries of existence, with those profound questions concerning life and death, the soul, and the infinite, which, by their very nature, seem to demand an unchangeable answer? Or is it rather that the institutional forms of religion, the external structures and dogmas, have been so long established that they have acquired a sanctity and authority which resist change? Yet, if we look back through history, we see that religion itself has not been devoid of evolution. The great religious reformers were, after all, innovators who broke with the past to establish new understandings of the divine. What they often faced, and what perhaps we	1911	1936.9667

"546 DEMOCRACY IMPERILLED THROUGH JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE USURPATION IN this issue we publish an important and timely paper by Otto Christensen, LL. M., on Judicial Usurpation. There are few questions before the American patriot today so grave or that so urgently call for the serious attention of conscience guided and intelligent citizens as the usurpation of government functions by coordinate departments. Democracy or free institutions cannot exist in other than name, if we as a people are to supinely permit unchallenged such bureaucratic usurpations as have marked recent years in the executive department, and such judicial arrogations of power as that recently so impressively described by Justice Harlan in his protest against the Supreme Court's reading into the law meanings which Congress refused to express and which the Court itself had previously refused to recognise on the ground that it would be an act of legislation. La fouette's Weekly admirably states the case, in so far as it relates to the latest example of what Justice Harlan happily characterised as ""wholly unjustified judicial legislation."""	The article by Christensen delves deeply into the historical precedents that have allowed such overreach to occur, tracing it back to shifts in legal interpretations and the gradual expansion of judicial review. He argues that while judicial review is indeed a necessary mechanism to uphold the Constitution, it has been wielded in recent years far beyond its intended scope, encroaching on the legislative powers that are clearly delineated within our governmental structure. This, Christensen contends, has led to a significant imbalance in the separation of powers that is foundational to American democracy. Moreover, Christensen highlights similar concerns within the executive branch, where executive orders and administrative regulations seem increasingly to bypass the legislative process. This not only undermines the role of elected representatives but also diminishes the voice of the electorate, leading to a governance that is less responsive and accountable.  The paper calls for a reevaluation of these trends, suggesting that legislative clarity and stricter adherence to the non-delegation doctrine could serve as counterbalances to these issues. Christensen concludes with a call to action for citizens, lawmakers, and the judiciary itself to engage in a	1911	2007.2057

"Dr. Theal says: "" It is difficult to conceive of a human being in a more depraved condition than that of a Bushman ""; but adds, "" They probably enjoyed more real happiness in life than the destitute class in any European city."" Dr. Theal states that Dr. Bleek, by comparing the language of the least modified Hottentots with the speech of sections of the inhabitants of the Northern Africa, pronounced them to have close affinities, the Hottentot agreeing with the Hamitic. Semitic and Indo european languages in having a grammatic sex or gender. Meinhof extends this comparison, and decides that the Hottentot language is Hamitic. There is other evidence to show that the Hottentots themselves may be a Hamitic bushman cross which probably took place somewhere in Eastern Africa, perhaps in what is now British East Africa. Concerning the vexed question of the ruins of Rhodesia, Dr. Theal maintains a discreet impartiality."	He suggests that while they might well be the work of a more advanced indigenous civilization, possibly linked to early Hamitic or even Semitic traders, there is also the possibility that they could be attributed to later historical movements, such as the migrations of the Bantu peoples. Theal points out that the architectural styles and the methods used in the construction of the Rhodesian ruins bear some similarities to other known structures across Africa which are attributed to various periods and cultures, making a definitive conclusion challenging. Further, Theal discusses the importance of oral histories and traditional knowledge in understanding the origins and the history of the Rhodesian ruins. He argues that while these sources must be critically evaluated, they provide invaluable insights that are not always available through archaeological or linguistic studies alone. According to Theal, the convergence of archaeological findings, linguistic studies, and oral traditions may eventually lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the ruins and their creators. In conclusion, Dr. Theal emphasizes the need for further interdisciplinary research to explore these complex historical questions.

The spirits have been renounced, but they still exist, and are in general inimical to the new faith and angry with their former patrons who have renounced them. The foundation of the next story we have to tell is no doubt a discussion by some missionary of a text the substance of which is that everything on earth, and all that men have, is from God. This the Eskimos have understood in a manner to make Christ practically the equivalent of the ancient culture hero., Just as Hiawatha gave mankind the Indian corn and taught us how to cultivate it, so Christ has given the white men everything they have and taught them everything they know. Consequently it is not such a wonderful thing, nor indeed one with which we ought to credit ourselves particularly, that we possess marvellous inventions and much knowledge. It is Christ who deserves the credit for having taught white men how to raise wheat and grind it into flour.	This understanding, while it may seem simplistic, actually reveals a profound integration of Christian teachings with the traditional Eskimo worldview. In their eyes, Christ becomes not just a spiritual savior but also a giver of practical wisdom and material benefits, much like the figures from their own legends who brought vital skills and knowledge to their people. This blending of beliefs illustrates the adaptive nature of culture and religion, showing how new ideas can be woven into the existing fabric of a society, making them more acceptable and meaningful to the local population. Moreover, this interpretation by the Eskimos highlights their appreciation for the practical, everyday benefits of religion, not just its spiritual promises. It underscores a universal aspect of human nature: the desire to understand and explain the sources of one's fortune and the workings of the world. By attributing their advancements to Christ, just as they had previously done with their own cultural heroes, they maintain continuity in their worldview, providing a bridge between the old and the new, the spiritual and the practical. This narrative also serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in cross-cultural religious missions. What missionaries	1913	2006.4867
These are the sexually embittered women in whom everything has turned into gall and bitterness of heart and hatred of men. Their legislative programme is licence for themselves or else restrictions for man. Next there file past the incomplete. One side of their nature has undergone atrophy, with the result that they have lost touch with their living fellowmen and women. Their programme is to convert the whole world into an epicene institution — an epicene institution in which man and woman shall everywhere work side by side at the selfsame tasks and for the selfsame pay.	Then, there come the idealists, those who dream of a world crafted from the purest visions of equality and justice, where gender holds no sway over one's place or pay. They see a future where the division of labor is not dictated by tradition but by ability, and where every individual, regardless of sex, is judged solely by the content of their character and the quality of their contributions. They speak not of restrictions or licenses, but of opportunities and fairness, striving to uplift all humanity to a universal standard of living and respect. Behind them march the pragmatists who, while sympathetic to the idealists’ dreams, focus on the incremental changes needed to approach such ideals. They work within the current systems to affect change, advocating for equal pay for equal work, better representation of women in leadership roles, and stronger protections against discrimination. They operate on the principle that small steps consistently taken can eventually cover great distances. Each group, regardless of their perspective or approach, contributes to the ongoing dialogue about gender roles and equality. Their collective voices highlight the complexities of the issues at hand and the varied	1911	1966.7013
Thus, today, he finds himself at the crossroads of four vast infinities. Beneath him is the underworld of chemical and microscopic life, and lives, with all its potency and portent. Around him are the vegetable and animal lives, preceding his own, in all their significant series of functional services and expressional characters. Above him, the telescope reveals the stupendous panorama of celestial worlds, unfolding in ever vaster and ascending series of suns and satellites; while within himself, and more amazing than all, he is discovering and extending that unseen but most real and demonstrable spirit world of intelligence, intuition, reason, emotion, inspiration and aspiration, creative conception and moral vision, by which he recognises himself at one with his Great Author, and the magnificent gift of conscious existence conferred. Through all and common to all worlds, he finds prevailing principles of unity, order, continuity, harmony, controlling infinite extension into variety, diversity, complexity. And, strange to utter!	in all this vastness and variety, he discerns a reflection of his own spirit. He perceives, as it were, the echo of his own soul in the grand symphony of the universe. The more he explores, the more he realizes that the laws which govern the stars are akin to those which govern his own being. The atoms that dance in the distant galaxies are not unlike those that spark within his brain. The forces that hold the planets in their paths are the same that bind his own life to the Earth. It is a realization that brings with it both humility and exaltation. Humility, as he sees his own infinitesimal place in the cosmos; exaltation, as he recognizes the cosmic scale of the principles that animate his spirit. In this discovery, there is a profound sense of kinship with the universe, a feeling that he is not merely an observer of the cosmos but a participant in its grand unfolding. This unity of the macrocosm and microcosm suggests that the human quest for knowledge and understanding is not just a personal journey but a cosmic one	1911	1972.6969
"Report N? 88. m Vertical tubes 3  SECTION AB. Ate 8AO Hydrogen) Air Tubea Tubes Water tr  Horizontal \Atubea with arrangement of taps Water   275 The chief sources of error are : — 1. Inaccuracy in measurement of the effective height. The hydrogen is at atmospheric pressure at the point where it leaves the apparatus, and nowhere else : the effective height of the gas column is the height of the upper horizontal capillary tap above this point : the percentage error here is obviously made less by having the vertical tubes longer. With reasonable care a length of one metre is sufficient to give an accuracy of 0""1 percent, in the determination of the lifting power."	2. Variations in atmospheric pressure. The experiment depends on the assumption that the atmospheric pressure remains constant during the time taken for measurements. Any fluctuation in atmospheric pressure can alter the density of the hydrogen, thereby affecting the lifting power calculated. It is advisable to monitor the barometric pressure throughout the experiment to account for any significant changes. 3. Temperature effects on the gas. Hydrogen's density is also sensitive to temperature changes. An increase in temperature can cause the gas to expand, lowering its density and thus its lifting power. Conversely, a decrease in temperature will increase the density and lifting power. Controlling the ambient temperature or correcting for temperature variations is crucial for accurate results. 4. Leakage and seal integrity. Any leakage in the system, especially at the joints and taps, can lead to loss of hydrogen, introducing errors in the volume and pressure measurements. Ensuring all connections are airtight and checking regularly for leaks during the experiment can minimize this source of error. 5. Purity of hydrogen. The presence of impurities or a mixture of gases other than hydrogen in the tubes can significantly	1912	1985.8395
The fleet was anchored off Rosyth, the battleships in two lines ahead, headed by the flagships Vanguard and Captain. The Vanguard and Captain, the leading ships in the starboard and port lines respectively, were just abreast of the Beamer Rock and  Port Edgar. The seven armoured cruisers were moored in the St. Margaret's Hope Anchorage. To torpedo craft coming from the sea and passing under the Forth Bridge, the fleet thus offered a narrow front, and comparatively few of its guns would bear. About 2.30 a.m.. on Sunday morning, the lookout of the Vanguard detected white foam, as from the bows of a destroyer, just under Battery Point ; a few seconds later, the same sign was seen to the south of Inchgarvie, and as the bugles sounded and the 12-in.	guns swung into position, the tension aboard the Vanguard was palpable. The crew, roused from their quarters, manned their battle stations with practiced urgency. The night was moonless and the sea ominously calm, with only the gentle lapping of the waves against the hull breaking the silence.  From the bridge, Admiral Maynard peered through his night glasses, trying to discern the shadowy figures of the approaching torpedo craft. His heart raced as he considered the strategic implications of their position and the imminent threat. The fleet, though powerful, was vulnerable in this narrow formation, especially against a swift and coordinated torpedo attack. As the minutes ticked by, more signs of the enemy's approach became visible. The water churned more violently and the distinct silhouette of torpedo boats emerged from the darkness, cutting through the water with lethal intent. Orders were barked out, and the sound of machinery and men preparing for combat filled the air. The first torpedoes were launched at 2:45 a.m., streaking towards the Vanguard and Captain with deadly precision. Quick to respond, the	1906	1976.3717
The rule determining the subjects upon which experts may testify and the rules prescribing the qualifications of experts are matters of law, but whether a witness offered as an expert has those qualifications is a question of fact to be decided by the court at the trial We have chieﬂy to deal with the law, as we cannot determine the judges’ opinions of individual cases {or person).	In general, to qualify as an expert, the witness must possess special knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education sufficient to qualify them as an authority on the subject in question. This specialized knowledge must be such that it is not common to the average person, providing the court with information pertinent and necessary to the case that would otherwise be out of reach. The court's role in this process is to evaluate the proposed expert's credentials and relevance to the case at hand, ensuring that the testimony provided will be both reliable and beneficial in resolving the factual matters at issue. The judge must consider whether the expert's background directly relates to the specific topics and issues of the litigation and whether their insights are based on scientifically sound and accepted methodologies. Furthermore, the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by rules such as those outlined in the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 702, which states that an expert may testify if their specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. The testimony must be based on sufficient facts or data, be the product	1913	1983.7047
"When working class children get their rightful education, the economic and industrial injustices as we know them now will be impossible. When the "" tone "" of rich and poor is the same, the rich will find it impossible to regard the poor as a different species. And the poor will also cease to do the same. Speaking the same language, having the same assured bearing, wearing the human regimentals — clothes — in the same way, the poor will see that their exploitation is a crime, and their submission to it an intolerable disgrace."	Thus, education becomes not merely a tool for personal advancement but a transformative force for societal equity. It is the great equalizer, breaking down the barriers erected by birth and fortune. Through the broadening of minds and the sharpening of wits, it fosters a new generation equipped not only with knowledge but with a sense of justice and the courage to demand it. The classroom, therefore, should be a crucible where the future of a fairer society is forged. Curriculum should not only teach reading, writing, and arithmetic but also instill an understanding of rights, duties, and the dignity inherent to every individual. As education sheds light on the shared human condition, it reveals the interconnectedness of all people, regardless of economic status. In such an enlightened society, the artificial distinctions that fuel discrimination and exploitation begin to crumble. The educated worker, aware of their worth and rights, becomes a formidable force against injustice. Similarly, the educated wealthy, unable to ignore the humanity of their less affluent brethren, are compelled to reconsider their roles in perpetuating inequality.

It is materialising already. Here and there it stands on solid ground, and it is not expensive. It is your business, and yours alone, to set it up everywhere. How many of you are learning architecture ? Apprentice yourselves at once (it is far better fun than cooking), and then by the time you get your votes, you can begin by making a law that every firm of architects shall contain at least one partner who is a woman. Finally. A word of warning. Emancipation has its dangers, as the freed blacks found to their cost when they had to work for competition wages. When you have swept the kitchen away from your house, beware of the seven devils in the drawing room, lest they enslave you more abjectly than ever.	Women, take heed not to replace the old chains with new ones of your own making. You are stepping into realms where your influence can reshape the world; wield this power wisely. Don't let the allure of the material and the superficial dictate your actions or cloud your judgment. The drawing room, though free from the soot and the heat of the kitchen, can still harbor its own forms of confinement—those of social expectations and conventional norms that bind your spirit and creativity just as tightly as any kitchen wall. As you venture into architecture, into law, into all fields of public and private endeavor, remember that your goal is not merely to participate but to transform. The structures you build should not just stand as monuments to your inclusion, but as testaments to your innovation and vision. Create spaces that liberate, that give life to the aspirations of all who enter them. And as you fight for your place in these fields, remember that true emancipation is not the mere act of filling roles that men have traditionally held. It is the profound responsibility of redefining these roles entirely, of building	1911	1998.0072
"- This little portrait is today in the ilusee de Condy at Chantilly, collection du due d'Aumale; it is, like the other portraits by Carmontelle, a wash drawing. On the back is to be read, in the writing of Ledans, to whom the preservation of this precious collection is due, ""Le cdlebre Garrick, tragique et comique. Car montelle delinavit ad vivum, 1765. Cette caricature fut faite au Rainey, sous les yeux de M. le due d'Orleans et pass pour une des plus parfaitement ressemblantes de auteur, dont le merit connu etait la minutieuse fidelite dans la physionornie."" (See Chantilly, les portraitt de Carmontelle, par F. A. Gruyer, Paris, 1902.) As M. Gruyer remarks, the portrait is by no means a caricature ; it is a most successful and characteristic study."	"The depiction captures Garrick's expressive features with a precision that belies the casual, almost flippant, term ""caricature"" as used in the note. Carmontelle's skill in rendering the nuances of facial expression shines through, allowing the viewer to glimpse the dynamic range that Garrick, renowned for his dramatic versatility, brought to both tragic and comic roles. The lightness of the wash drawing technique adds a certain ethereal quality to the portrait, enhancing the liveliness and immediacy of the depiction.  It is perhaps this very liveliness that led contemporaries to describe the portrait as caricature-like, for it distills the essence of Garrick’s theatrical genius into a single, vivid image. The setting of its creation, at the Rainey under the watchful eyes of the Duke of Orleans, suggests a moment captured amidst a lively and discerning audience, adding further to the portrait’s historical and cultural significance. Thus, while the term ""caricature"" might imply exaggeration or distortion, in this instance, it seems more a testament to Carmontelle’s ability"	1912	1997.4445

""Yes, yes."" The old seaman came closer, and looked at his son's hands."	"""They don't look like the hands of a man who's been working the ropes and braving the sea, Jim,"" he observed skeptically, his voice tinged with a mix of hope and doubt. ""They're too soft, too clean. Where's the calluses, the scars of a sailor's life?"" Jim hesitated, his eyes darting away guiltily. ""Well, you see, father, it was a different sort of voyage, more... more of a passenger, like. I didn’t need to work the ships myself."" The old man's face fell, a deep sigh escaping his lips as he stepped back, his eyes clouding over with disappointment. ""A passenger,"" he muttered under his breath, the word tasting bitter. ""And what of the money, son? The riches you spoke of in your letters?"" Jim shuffled uncomfortably, his earlier confidence dissipating under his father's intense gaze.

The values obtained are not of a general character: they may differ appreciably from one type of wing to another. In the experiments the angle of incidence was 5°; the aspect ratio 6: 1.

This variability highlights the critical importance of tailoring the angle of incidence according to the specific aerodynamic characteristics of each wing type. In practice, this means that engineers and designers must carefully analyze the airflow and pressure distribution for each wing design to optimize performance. This optimization often involves both theoretical calculations and empirical testing, including wind tunnel experiments and flight tests. For example, the Crescent Type wing, which exhibits a slightly higher lift coefficient (Cl) at the same angle of incidence compared to the Bleriot wing, might perform better in scenarios requiring higher lift at lower speeds, such as in short takeoff and landing aircraft. Conversely, the Bleriot, with its lower drag coefficient (Cd), might be more suitable for applications where higher speed and efficiency are critical. Thus, understanding these nuances allows for more informed decisions in aircraft design and can significantly impact the overall efficiency, performance, and safety of the aircraft. Furthermore, these insights underscore the need for continuous research and development in aerodynamics to refine existing models and develop new technologies that push the boundaries of what is currently possible in aviation.	1912	2005.873
In the rival newspaper offices the  report was, as yet, unknown. With journalistic forethought he had arranged that at present the bewildering truth should not leak out to his rivals, either from the railway termini or from the telephone exchange. His only fear was that some local correspondent might telegraph from some village or town nearer the metropolis which was still in communication with the central office. Time passed very slowly. Each moment increased his anxiety. He had sent out the one reporter who remained on duty to the house of Colonel Sir James Taylor, the Permanent Undersecretary for War.	"The reporter was tasked with confirming details directly from the source, to solidify the story's credibility before it hit the presses. Meanwhile, he paced the floor of his cramped office, glancing repeatedly at the clock. It was nearing midnight, and the morning edition's deadline loomed ominously. Every tick of the clock seemed to echo in the otherwise silent room, heightening his tension.  He knew the magnitude of the news they were about to break could cause a public uproar, and accuracy was paramount. False information could not only discredit the paper but also cause unnecessary panic among the populace. His hands trembled slightly as he reached for his cup of coffee, now cold and bitter. Just as he set down the cup, the telegraph machine started chattering. He rushed over, his heart pounding in anticipation. The message was from his reporter, coded quickly but clearly: ""Confirmed by Col. Taylor. Details align. Returning immediately."" Relief washed over him for a moment, followed by a renewed sense of urgency. He grabbed his hat and coat, preparing to meet the reporter halfway"	1906	1996.1439
"Apparently, from his attempting to assure the ladies of the deputation that the point of precedence was not important, he either did not, or did not wish to, consider it of value, and not one of the women present had the sense to see it so, or political acumen to press it upon him! I was surprised; but I know, of course, the "" Adult Suffrage "" red herring scent is very seductive and confusing to the ordinary Suffrage mind. •My objection to the present militant outburst is that it is premature and ill timed. The only true and logical position for all Suffragists was that of a solid combination, to demand fulfilment of the Conciliation Bill pledge before franchise extension of any kind should be considered."	This was the strategic moment to hold firm, to present a united front and to extract a clear commitment. But alas, the unity was fractured, the moment lost. The government, ever cunning, seized upon this disarray to sidestep the pressing issue of women’s suffrage by introducing broader, but less contentious, franchise reforms. These, while progressive in their own right, effectively diluted the immediate imperative for women's enfranchisement, pushing it further down the agenda. The militants, with their dramatic actions and fervent zeal, undoubtedly drew attention to the cause. Yet, one must question the efficacy of their methods. Did they truly advance the cause, or did they merely succeed in alienating potential allies and hardening the opposition? It is a delicate balance, this interplay between moderate lobbying and radical activism, and it requires careful calibration. In the end, what is needed is not just passion and protest but also political savvy and a keen sense of timing. The suffrage movement must navigate these turbulent waters with both the fire of conviction and the cool-headed strategy of seasoned campaigners.	1911	1987.2084

He said you were the best, most sympathetic man in town."" She paused, pressed the black bordered handkerchief to her lips before she could go on. "" Who, ma'am? A dear friend, did you say ?"" he managed to inquire. He was flattered. He did not think a single man in Atlanta knew him except a wholesale merchant, who certainly entertained no complimentary opinion of him if his cruelly insistent letters about due bills were any evidence. "" I — how stupid of me to forget his name! But he knows you and admires you so much!"" Beasley's eyes were still bloodshot from his sleep. He sat like an old turtle with his head thrown out waiting for the next bait."	"She hesitated, her eyes darting around the room as if seeking inspiration from the mundane objects scattered about. ""He spoke so highly of you,"" she continued, her voice a mixture of nervousness and determination. ""He mentioned how you helped him out of a difficult situation once, and how grateful he was for your kindness and discretion."" Beasley's curiosity was piqued, though his confusion was evident. ""Well, ma'am, that's mighty kind of him, whoever he is. I reckon it's not every day one gets praised like that without even knowing."" He chuckled, a bit of warmth breaking through his initial reserve. ""Yes, indeed,"" she replied, her voice softening. ""It's why I knew I could turn to you in my hour of need."" She leaned forward, clasping her hands tightly in her lap. ""You see, Mr. Beasley, I find myself in quite a precarious situation, and I remembered what my friend said about you. I thought perhaps, just perhaps, you might be willing to offer me some advice, or even assistance."" "	1913	1962.0854

Here it will be seen that without any other lighting the appearance is very good, but the name on the facia is unreadable. In the second case the inside lights are extinguished, and the outside lights only in operation. Again, the general effect of the lighting in the window is good, and notwithstanding the reflectors to the high pressure lamps the name on the facia is readable.	In the third scenario, both inside and outside lights are in operation simultaneously. This combination provides the optimal illumination for the shop front, enhancing both the visibility of the merchandise within the window and the readability of the name on the facia. The use of high pressure lamps with reflectors significantly improves the distribution of light, ensuring that it is both effective and efficient. Furthermore, the evenly spaced lamps along the length of the shop front create a uniform light distribution that minimizes shadows and dark spots. This uniformity is crucial for attracting the attention of potential customers, as it highlights the products on display and makes the entire shop front inviting. It is also worth noting that the angle and the height at which the lamps are mounted play a significant role in achieving the desired lighting effect. Properly angled lamps ensure that the light is focused on the target areas without causing glare or discomfort to the eyes of passersby. Additionally, mounting the lamps at a height that aligns well with the top of the window helps in maximizing the coverage area of the illumination while maintaining a clean aesthetic look of the shop front.

In situations where the employee was not expressly hired to invent, but where the invention falls within the scope of the employee's job duties or was made using the employer's time, facilities, or materials, courts have often ruled that the employer retains the rights to the invention.

The pressure field determined by the isobars controls the winds over the total area illustrated. One of the most important features of the isobars is the manner in which they change direction at a front. Isobars drawn through a front are always constructed in a manner to make the angle which includes the low pressure area less than 180°, and the angle which includes high pressure more than 180°. For example, in Fig. 92 the 990 MB isobar of the young cyclone on the Gulf Coast is drawn with inner angle containing less than 180°. If isobars change direction abruptly at a front the wind direction, which is dependent on the direction of isobars, must also change direction through an equal angle.	This phenomenon is crucial for meteorologists when predicting wind shifts, which can be sudden and severe, affecting everything from aviation to marine navigation. Furthermore, the curvature of the isobars near a front indicates the intensity of the wind. Tighter isobars, or those that are closer together, suggest stronger winds. This is due to the greater pressure gradient between the high and low-pressure zones. Understanding the behavior of isobars at a front also assists in predicting weather changes. For instance, a sharp turn toward a low-pressure area often signals the approach of a storm system, bringing potentially heavy rain and thunderstorms. Conversely, a shift toward a high-pressure zone might indicate clearing skies and calmer weather ahead. Moreover, the orientation of isobars in relation to the front can help determine the type of front (cold, warm, occluded, stationary) and the nature of the weather it will bring. In cold fronts, for example, isobars typically show a more pronounced curvature and are associated with more dramatic changes in weather, including cooler temperatures and more intense precipitation. By analyzing these	1913	2005.1421
He retired from the stage in 1786, at the age of sixty-five ; but five years later, when the French Comedy had fallen on evil days amid the storms of the Revolution, he played several times and succeeded in attracting the public back to the theatre. Brizard was a fine character actor, usually cast as King or Father. For such parts he was excellently suited by his high stature, dignified presence, and snowy head — a very narrow escape from drowning in the B/hone having turned his hair white at an early age. Garrick probably saw him as Argire in Tancrede, Siffredi in Blanche et Ouiscard, Eustache de St. Pierre in Le Siege de Calais; later he created the r61e of Montaigu in Ducis's Romeo et Juliette and lear in the same author's version of that Shakespearean tragedy. He was renowned for his wonderful memory and for his imperturbable coolness.	Brizard's performances were noted for their depth and emotional resonance, which allowed him to captivate his audience and bring a sense of realism to the grandiose characters he portrayed. His interpretation of Lear, in particular, was celebrated for its poignant portrayal of the king's descent into madness. Critics of the time praised his ability to transition from regal dignity to profound vulnerability, a feat that not only demonstrated his wide acting range but also deepened the audience's engagement with the tragedy. Offstage, Brizard was equally esteemed among his peers and the public. His dedication to the craft was evident in his meticulous preparation for each role and his commitment to maintaining the integrity of the plays he performed. Despite the turbulent times that marked his later years, his passion for the theatre never waned, and he continued to mentor younger actors and advocate for the arts. His contribution to French theatre during a critical period of its history helped to sustain its cultural significance and ensured its survival through the Revolution. Even after his final retirement, the legacy of his performances and his leadership in the theatre community left an indelible	1912	1999.8873
Length of carapace 7 to 9 inches, width from 5 to 6iti inches. Southern Australia from West to East. In October or November the tortoises prepare for their family duties by making a small circular hole with their hind feet in the bank in which to deposit their eggs. The excavation is about two inches in diameter at the surface and six inches deep, generally a little wider at the bottom. From 7 to 21 pure white eggs  200 are laid. They are oval and elongated, 1 inch 2 lines long and 8 lines broad, and are not laid in any regular order, being in all positions. The hole is filled up with earth, and some mud pressed down over the top by the mother, which when it dries and hardens looks just like the surrounding soil. The nests are occasionally, at a considerable distance from the water, in dry, hard soil. I captured one in January on the banks of the Macalister River, in Gippsland, and carried it with me for some hours. It possessed a remarkable odour of garlic, which indeed is a useful indication of the proximity of the tortoise. On being left in a bucket of water for an hour it surprised me by depositing four eggs in the water. long necked Tortoise. Prnlr, Html. Viet.	The long-necked tortoise, scientifically known as *Chelodina*, is notable for its distinctly elongated neck, which is often as long as or longer than its carapace. This unique adaptation allows it to strike at prey from a considerable distance, giving it an advantage in the murky waters it often inhabits. These reptiles are primarily aquatic, spending the majority of their time submerged in rivers, lakes, or marshes. Their diet consists mainly of fish, crustaceans, and aquatic insects, which they capture with a sudden thrust of their head and neck. During the breeding season, these tortoises exhibit fascinating nesting behaviors, traveling significant distances overland to find suitable sites for egg deposition. The long-necked tortoise's ability to adapt to varying water conditions and its opportunistic feeding habits have allowed it to thrive across a wide range of environments in Southern Australia. Despite their resilience, habitat destruction and water pollution pose significant threats to their populations. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure that these distinctive creatures continue to inhabit Australian waterways for generations to come. Their role in the	1909	1985.7474
W. BASSETT JONES makes some interesting remarks on architectural effects and lighting. He shows how the tendency of some systems (especially indirect lighting) is to invert the ordinary shadows received from daylight. To overcome this a careful study of the amount of light allotted to walls and ceiling is necessary ; it is also possible to mitigate unfamiliar lighting effects by the use of suitable colour tones. In Licht und Lamp (Aug. 15) there is an interesting account of a collection of old forms of lamps somewhat similar to that possessed by Mr. Johnston and described in our last numbers. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Most of the articles call for little comment. Perhaps the most interesting is the account of the Mercury cadmium Lamps devised by WOLFKE (E.T.Z. ', Sept. 5). This is noticed elsewhere in this issue.	The Mercury cadmium lamps, as explained by WOLFKE, represent a significant advancement in the area of electric lighting, particularly in terms of efficiency and color rendering. These lamps utilize a blend of mercury and cadmium vapors, which when excited electrically, emit light with improved spectral qualities. This innovation not only enhances the luminosity but also provides a more natural color compared to the traditional, harsher light of standard mercury lamps. In the context of architectural lighting, the application of these lamps can be quite transformative. By judiciously employing these advanced light sources, architects and designers can achieve more nuanced and aesthetically pleasing effects, crucial for highlighting the intricate details and textures of building facades and interiors. Moreover, the improved color rendering can make these lighting solutions particularly suitable for spaces like art galleries and museums, where the true colors of artworks need to be accurately conveyed. As lighting technology continues to evolve, the integration of scientific advancements with architectural creativity promises to open up new possibilities for enhancing both the functionality and the visual appeal of lighted spaces. The ongoing research and development in this field are	1912	1996.0255
To these two simple elements in the strate gics of the southeastern district, which was the base from which all the conquest of Britain proceeded, a third element should be added. The length of the detour from Portsmouth to London by way of Winchester and Stains was so considerable as to suggest during some period of the Roman occupation the building of an expensive but strategically valuable short cut by which in time of need troops could be hastened to what was soon the largest town in Britain and the main crossing of the Thames. A military obstacle far less formidable, of course, than such a range as the Pennines or than any considerable river menaced an army trying to take the shortest cut from the south coast to London, and this was the clay land of the Sussex Weald.	The Weald, with its dense forests and marshy grounds, posed significant challenges to any military movement and effectively acted as a natural barrier. The Romans, known for their engineering prowess, would not have been deterred by such obstacles for long. They likely would have constructed roads through or around the Weald to facilitate rapid troop movements and ensure secure lines of communication and supply between the coast and the capital. Roman road-building was typically a blend of practicality and strategic foresight. The roads were constructed straight wherever possible, to allow for the quick movement of soldiers and messages. However, in the Weald, the Romans would have had to balance directness with the need to avoid the worst of the natural barriers. They might have chosen routes that skirted the densest forests and driest paths through the marshes, possibly elevating the roadbeds in the wettest areas to keep them passable year-round. The construction of such a road would have involved extensive labor, likely drawn from local populations under Roman control, and possibly even from the Roman legions themselves. The road would be built	1912	1977.6742
The reason for withdrawing this subsidy was the need for economy, as money had to be obtained to pay members of Parliament. The Cunard Company, unable to bear the enormous cost of running both its huge 25 knot steamers, was compelled to sell the Lusitania, but with patriotic enterprise it retained the Mauretania, even though she was only worked at a dead loss. The Mauretania, almost immediately after the outbreak of war, had been commissioned as a British cruiser, with orders specially to hunt for the Lusitania, which had now been renamed the Preussen. But it was easier  to look for the great commerce destroyer than to find her, and for weeks the one ship hunted over the wide waters of the North Atlantic for the other.	The chase became a grim game of cat and mouse, with the Mauretania's crew straining every nerve to locate their former sister ship. Reports of the Preussen's sightings came sporadically, often delayed and sometimes contradictory, leading to wild goose chases across vast swathes of ocean. The British Admiralty supplied the Mauretania with the latest in naval intelligence and wireless technology, hoping to give her the edge in this high-stakes pursuit. As weeks turned into months, the situation grew increasingly tense. The Mauretania, refitted with heavier armaments and a crew bolstered by experienced naval officers, patrolled the shipping lanes, always on the alert for any sign of the elusive Preussen. The North Atlantic was fraught with dangers, not only from the hostile ship they pursued but also from lurking submarines and treacherous weather. Meanwhile, the Preussen utilized every trick known to maritime evasion. She changed her appearance, using false flags and even altering her silhouette with makeshift structures. She avoided traditional shipping routes, slipping through lesser-known passages and relying on the skill	1906	1993.8049
"The fellow was evidently greatly astonished to see only one gentleman get out of the carriage wherein two had entered, but he made no comment. He gathered up his reins and drove slowly away up the lamplit street. Ere the cab disappeared, another drove rapidly up, and even before it had stopped the door was flung violently open and a stout, burly little man, with black moustaches waxed and turned up at the point, hopped out upon the pavement. He ran to Huntford and, catching him violently by the arm, poured out upon him a torrent of excited German words. "" I don't understand you, "" said Hunt ford. "" I don't speak German."" "" Ach!"" cried the other, with an oath. "" Dot man who vas mit you come, vere is he alretty?"" "" You'Re mistaken."" said Huntford. "" Nobody was with me; I came alone."""

Finally, with a grunt of dissatisfaction, he turned back to Huntford. ""You must tell me, or it vill be worse for you. I must find dot man. It is of utmost importance."" Seeing no way to calm the man's agitation, Huntford decided to take a more diplomatic approach. ""If you could explain why you're looking for this person, perhaps I could be of some assistance.

Peter wondered now, with more whimsical humour than an angry lover has any right to feel, why the deuce she had accepted him. She was no more stirred than a cucumber — he could not flatter himself with one throbbing moment — and the Cleveland woods must have been full of many other eager, allured, presentable, hardworking young men who would have done as well as he. Perhaps his feeling had actually touched her; perhaps she liked the shade of his family tree, for his mother had been a Van Der Windt, and though Peter had to work  866 HARPER's MONTHLY MAGAZINE very hard for his good living, he had opportunity to play in fairly exclusive pastures — and perhaps there were not so many eligible and enamoured young men in those woods as Peter had imagined. But here Peter stopped his most un knightly speculations and whistled to his dog, who had returned from an excursion into the wood with a limp thing streaming from his mouth.	"The sight of the dog, so carefree and unburdened by human complexities, snapped Peter back to the present. He called sharply, ""Rex, drop it!"" The dog obeyed, leaving the unfortunate creature—a small, unfortunate rabbit—on the leaf-strewn ground. Peter sighed, the weight of his earlier ruminations momentarily lifted by the distraction. He bent down to check if there was any life left in the rabbit, but it was clearly beyond help. Straightening up, he resumed his walk, his thoughts drifting back to the enigmatic nature of his relationship. Why, indeed, had she accepted his proposal? Was it affection, or something more pragmatic? A partnership rather than a passion. He pondered this, the crisp autumn air sharp in his lungs, the rustle of the leaves underfoot a constant reminder of the changing seasons—perhaps a metaphor for his own evolving feelings. He loved her, there was no doubt about that, but as he walked, watched by the unjudging eyes of his dog, he wondered if love was enough, or"	1913	1979.6715

""Elder, "" she said, abruptly, ""I think you gotter deal 'ith your St. John."" "" Deal with — eh — who — what — with my St. John?"" said the elder, lowering his gaze to Miss Mahala's shawl — Miss Mahala would have held it an immodesty to go out without her shawl, even in the tropics.

"— It is precisely th? comparison "" two by two/' said by Condorcet to be the ultimate test, though "" very long, "" that the ingenious Nanson rules accomplish quickly. S. Doc. 359, G3-2 2  10 the candidate dropped out by the Ware rules, to Brown. The 6,600 votes by which in this case Brown was declared to be elected, though a majority, were made up, it is to be born in mind, of 4,000 voters who indicated on their ballots that they preferred Brown to either of the other candidates and of 2,600 voters who indicated not that they preferred Brown to Jones, but only that they preferred Brown to Smith. It is doubtless true that the probabilities are against the elimination thus under the Ware rules of the candidate who; < according to the record on the ballots, could command a clear majority of the votes against any other candidate taken singly; and the system is by no means to be condemned for political uses where a perfect majority preferential system cannot yet be adopted; but that it is not infallible in giving the result demanded by the criterion of Condorcet must be admitted. First choice."	The essence of the Condorcet method lies in its attempt to identify the candidate who would win any one-on-one matchup against every other candidate, thus arguably representing the most broadly acceptable choice among the electorate. However, as the scenario described demonstrates, the Ware rules, which are a form of single transferable vote (STV), do not always align with the Condorcet criterion. This divergence primarily arises because STV focuses on reaching a majority through a sequential elimination and redistribution of votes, which may overlook the overall pairwise preferences between candidates. In the example given, while Brown emerges as the majority winner under the Ware rules due to strategic eliminations and reallocations, it doesn't necessarily reflect that Brown is the candidate who could defeat each of the others in direct competition, as per Condorcet's ideal. This discrepancy underscores a critical debate in voting theory: the trade-off between practical electoral mechanisms and the philosophical quest for a candidate who embodies the most consensus. Moreover, this situation illustrates the complexities inherent in designing voting systems that both reflect the will of the people and are administratively feasible. Each system	1914	2006.7963
"In my explorations through Dutch Guiana alone with Bosch we paddled by abandoned moco moco rafts, saw escaping deportes drifting down the river ways, and twice in one night were attacked by them in camp in the dense forest. Later I ran across many de portes working honourably on plantations or in business in Paramaribo. Although extradition holds in both Dutch and British Guiana, the Dutch are inclined to give deportes opportunity to reform, and in Paramaribo, it is said, a society exists to assist escaped convicts. British Guiana usually orders deportes from the country within fourteen days. With tropical forests to east and west, and papers and money necessary for passage on an occasional steamer, departure is often impossible, as was proved by five deportes whose interesting story I listened to through the wooden bars in the Brick dam Police Station in Georgetown. "" What will be done with these men V I asked the officer, as I looked at their emaciated forms and hopeless faces. ""They will be sent back on the next French ma il."" Back to two years' extra labour and additional punishment!"	It seemed a grim fate, yet one not uncommon in these parts where the harsh realities of colonial law intersect with the desperate acts of those seeking freedom or a second chance. The officer's tone was matter-of-fact, underlining the routine nature of such proceedings, yet I wondered about the stories each of these men carried, the circumstances that led them to this confinement, far from any semblance of home or familiarity. As we continued our conversation, he explained that the policy was strict to discourage the notion that British Guiana could serve as a refuge for fugitives. Yet, the irony was not lost on me: the dense, unforgiving jungle that bordered this land was as much a prison as any cell in the Brick dam Police Station. The very geography that might have offered liberty was instead an insurmountable barrier, leaving these men caught between two worlds, neither of which offered them solace or forgiveness. Their tales were as varied as the paths of the rivers that wound through the Guianas—stories of hardship, of mistakes, some of crimes born of necessity, others of	1913	1980.5573

But even here the thing is little more than ravaging a belt of country with the hope of striking terror into those who govern it. Even the great struggle of Edmund Ironside against the invaders is strategically meaning less; a succession of battles, fought with no enduring effect by such forces as he could bring to action, now with success, now with ill success — never with a result or a political decision. But even in this random business the fighting and the marching proceed by the Roman roads or the older tracks, save where the Danish fleet compels an issue near the coast and far from such ways: — as at Ashindon in Essex.	The nature of warfare during this period was largely shaped by the immediate tactical necessities rather than by overarching strategic visions. The focus was on immediate survival and local superiority, with little thought given to long-term conquest or governance. This pattern of warfare, dominated by swift raids and abrupt retreats, was perfectly suited to the Danish style of fighting, which emphasized mobility and surprise. The Danes, adept at navigating both sea and river routes, could appear suddenly, strike quickly, and vanish before a substantive defensive force could be mustered. Edmund Ironside, though displaying valor and tactical acumen, was constrained by the very nature of his enemy and the terrain of his kingdom. His efforts, though heroic, were episodic—forced to respond to each new Viking incursion as it occurred, without the luxury of building and executing a consistent strategic plan. The battles he fought were desperate attempts to protect his realm, rather than calculated steps towards a secure and stable rule. This lack of strategic continuity, coupled with the relentless pressure from Danish forces, meant that any victory gained by Ironside was only temporary. The	1912	1967.0109
If the area of section XY is a square inches, and the pull is P  tonnes, the total shear at the section XY is P tonnes, and the average force per square inch is — P 9 = a This value q is the mean intensity of shear stress at the section XY. Fig. 3. 4. Strain. — Strain is the alteration of shape or dimensions resulting from stress. (r) Tensile strain is the stretch, and often results from a pull which causes a condition of tensile stress to be set up. It is in the direction of the tensile stress, and is measured by the fractional elongation.	(s) Compressive strain, in contrast, is the shortening or crushing of a material under compressive stress. This type of strain moves in the direction opposite to the applied load and is measured by the fractional reduction in length. (t) Shear strain occurs when the material is subjected to a force that causes it to deform in a manner similar to slippage between layers. This type of strain is characterized by the angle of deformation rather than by linear measurement. (u) Volumetric strain involves a change in the volume of the material and is often a result of a combination of stresses acting in different directions. It can be either an increase or a decrease in volume, depending on the nature of the stresses involved. (v) In engineering, understanding these different types of strain is crucial for designing structures and machinery that can withstand operational stresses without failure. Each type of strain has its own characteristics and effects on materials, and the proper calculation and anticipation of these strains can prevent catastrophic failures in engineering applications.	1908	1987.1055

"Statistics tell us that at the present time 74,90828 women are enrolled in the higher institutions of learning in this country. If each of these 75,000 college women and all who succeed them could go forth from their college life thoroughly prepared for their duties as women a great increase in individual and national efficiency might be expected. The fact that many women say they ""hate house work"" does not lessen their responsibility for doing it well since they undertake to do it. ""Wm. G. Curtis, ""Ages of Universities, "" Record Herald, April 15, 1910."	The training of women in our colleges should, therefore, not only be directed towards the expansion of their intellectual horizons but also towards practical life skills. It is essential that the curriculum includes courses that prepare them for the realities of daily life, including domestic management and the fundamentals of nutrition, child care, and budgeting. These skills are invaluable in empowering women to manage both a career and a household efficiently should they choose to do both. Moreover, the inclusion of such courses would help to dismantle the stigma that surrounds housework and domestic responsibilities. By educating women in these areas, we foster a respect for these tasks as valuable and skilled work. This shift in perception is crucial for achieving true gender equality, as it acknowledges and values the traditionally feminine roles that have been historically undervalued. Thus, while the increasing number of women in higher education is encouraging, it is imperative that the education they receive is comprehensive and prepares them for all facets of life. This approach will not only benefit the women themselves but also the larger society, which thrives when all its members are well-equipped to contribute to its various	1911	2005.5942
Effects of acceleration and deceleration on velocity and displacement of wind system centre. 3 hour intervals spotted. GH is the path of a decelerating centre, with point locations likewise 3 hours apart. If all the centres should possess uniform velocities such as illustrated by CD until they reached the first point to the right of A, C and G and then assume the velocities as shown, the effects of increased and decreased velocities are at once apparent. In a 15 hour interval between the first and last points on all the paths, the accelerated centre travels 425 miles, the parcel of uniform velocity 300 miles and the decelerated parcel only 175 miles. Any estimate or computation based on uniform velocity of upper and lower centres would be out 125 miles in 15 hours. EXAMPLES OF ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION.	Consider the implications of these variations in velocity on meteorological predictions and modeling. If meteorologists were to assume a constant velocity based on initial observations (represented by CD), their forecasts would significantly underestimate or overestimate the actual positions of storm centers, depending on whether the storm accelerated or decelerated. This miscalculation could lead to erroneous weather warnings, affecting everything from aviation safety to disaster preparedness. To further illustrate, let's observe two additional hypothetical scenarios: In the first, a storm center follows a path similar to GH, starting with a higher velocity and gradually decelerating. Initially, the storm moves quickly, covering a vast area in a short period, potentially catching a region off guard if the deceleration is not anticipated. As the storm slows, its effects might linger over areas longer than expected, leading to prolonged adverse weather conditions. In the second scenario, a storm center accelerates along a path similar to AB. Here, the storm could initially appear to pose little threat, moving sluggishly and covering minimal distance. However, as it gains speed, it could quickly become a	1913	2005.8995

We have only just emerged from the middle ages in medicine. The movement is still in unabated activity. The final goal is far from having yet been reached, and there are vast fields in medicine yet to be cultivated before the one sided and partial developments of the past will be amplified into a more symmetrical and perfect form. With medical research and progress continuing at the present rate, the outlook is rich with promise for the future development of medicine and added benefits for mankind. In looking over its history we can distinguish the operation of two contrary tendencies or methods of thought which have controlled the evolution of medicine. These two principles mark off the history of medicine into two epochs, the speculative and the scientific, of a distinctiveness more fundamental than the ordinary division into such periods as the ancient, Arabian and mediaeval. These two factors are: (1) the subjective, deductive, a priori or speculative, and (2) the objective, inductive, a posteriori, empirical or scientific, methods of attaining knowledge.	The speculative method, dominant in the early periods, was heavily influenced by philosophy and often relied on theoretical constructs rather than empirical evidence. It was characterized by the formulation of medical principles and theories based on deduction from accepted truths or axioms, which were seldom questioned or subjected to rigorous testing. This approach led to the establishment of various medical schools of thought, each adhering to its own set of doctrines and often clashing with others.  On the other hand, the scientific method, which began to gain prominence during the Renaissance and has increasingly defined modern medicine, emphasizes observation, experimentation, and the testing of hypotheses. It seeks to understand the laws of nature by direct interaction with the material world, relying on data and evidence rather than solely on theoretical speculation. This method has fostered a more systematic and empirical approach to medical research, leading to significant breakthroughs such as the germ theory of disease, the discovery of antibiotics, and advancements in surgical techniques. The transition from speculative to scientific medicine has not been abrupt but a gradual shift, marked by periods of overlap and conflict between the two methodologies. As we continue	1911	1973.8008

Children abounded in that house — her own half brothers and sisters, as well as the children of slaves — and in the joys of play Dulayut forgot easily all domestic slights and injuries. Gathering flowers for the necklaces and elaborate floral compositions which her mother helped to make for cremations and hair cuttings, was also a constantly recurring joy. Her father's property was large, and all the children in the compound, whether his own or those of his meanest slave, roamed freely through gardens and banana and mango groves."	The air was always filled with the sweet fragrances of tropical blooms and the calls of exotic birds. Life, for the most part, seemed an endless cycle of sun-drenched days and balmy nights under the stars. Dulayut's favorite spot was by the lotus pond, where the water lilies opened their blooms to the morning sun and closed them as dusk fell. Here, she would often sit and weave tales in her mind, or simply lie back and watch the clouds drift lazily across the sky. Her father, a man of considerable wealth and influence, was often preoccupied with the management of his estates, but he always found time to listen to the stories of Dulayut’s day when they gathered for the evening meal. It was during these times that Dulayut felt closest to her father, sensing a bond that transcended the usual barriers of status and expectation. Despite the idyllic setting, the shadows of the outside world sometimes crept into their paradise. News of political unrest, the whispers of change, would occasionally ripple through the adult conversations, hinting at	1911	1963.1251
""" Still, "" said John, "" it would be rather curious if we did have a crisis next year ; and I should not be surprised !"" As we were walking home next day, M'Allister suddenly tripped over some little projection and fell prone to the ground. John ran to his assistance and raised him up, at the same time asking "" If he were hurt ? "" "" No, not at all, "" said M'Allister ; "" I seemed to fall so lightly that I scarcely felt it when I touched the ground."" ""Ah, M'Allister!"" I exclaimed, ""if you had fallen like that upon our earth, I think you would not have come off quite scatheless."	"The gravity here does seem to be a trifle more forgiving."" John chuckled as he helped M'Allister dust off his clothing. ""Indeed,"" he agreed, ""one of the many peculiarities of this place that we're slowly getting accustomed to. A lighter fall, a softer landing—it's all part of the charm, isn't it?"" M'Allister, now fully upright and brushing the last bits of dirt from his jacket, looked thoughtful. ""It's fascinating,"" he mused, ""how different physical laws or even slight variations in them can so dramatically alter our experiences. Imagine the implications for physics back home—"" ""And for the simple act of walking,"" John interjected with a smirk. ""We might all become acrobats or dancers with such forgiving gravity."" As we continued our walk, the conversation drifted to other oddities and wonders we had observed in our explorations.

The seeds require some care, as they must be stratified or undergo a chilling period before they will germinate. This mimics the natural cycle of the seeds falling to the ground in autumn and experiencing the winter cold before sprouting in spring. Cuttings, on the other hand, can be taken from mature wood during the dormant season or from softwood during the growing season. These are placed in a moist medium and allowed to root, a process that can be enhanced by the use of rooting hormones. For those interested in quicker establishment and fruit production, grafting is another viable method. This involves attaching a scion from a mature, fruiting tree to a hardy rootstock. This method not only speeds up the fruiting process but can also combine the best traits of two different varieties, such as disease resistance and fruit quality. Pruning is essential for maintaining the health of the tree and encouraging fruit production. It should be done during the dormant season when the tree is not actively growing.

"Any boat crossing the river was at once challenged, and not allowed to approach unless under a flag of truce, or it was ascertained that its occupants were non belligerents. Everywhere the greatest precaution was being taken against spies, and on the two or three occasions when the Germans had reconnoitred by means of balloons, sharpshooters had constantly fired at them. As may well be imagined, spy mania was now rife in every quarter in South London, and any man bearing a foreign name, no matter of what nationality, or known to be a foreigner, was at once suspected, and often openly insulted, even though he might be a naturalised Englishman. It was very unsafe for any foreigner now to go abroad. One deplorable incident occurred that afternoon. A German baker, occupying a shop in Newington Butts, and who had lived in England twenty five years and become a naturalised British subject, was walking along the Kennington Road with his wife, having come forth in curiosity to see what was in progress, when he was met by a man with whom he had had some business quarrel. The man in question, as he passed, cried out to the crowd that he was a German. "" He's one of Von Kronhelm's spies!"""	Immediately, the situation escalated as the crowd, already on edge, turned their attention to the baker. Shouts and accusations filled the air, and within moments, the baker was surrounded by an angry, fearful mob. Despite his protests and his wife's frantic attempts to defend him, explaining their long residence and naturalization status, the gathering did not heed their words. The baker, whose only crime was his birthplace, found himself subjected to a barrage of insults and physical threats. The police, spotting the commotion from a distance, hurried towards the crowd. With considerable effort, they managed to disperse the mob and rescue the couple from further harm. However, the damage was done. The baker was visibly shaken, his faith in his adopted community deeply wounded by the baseless assault. This incident highlighted the dangerous levels of paranoia and xenophobia that had taken hold. It served as a stark reminder of the thin line between rational precaution and irrational fear, especially in times of conflict. The authorities, recognizing the potential for such incidents to escalate into widespread violence, increased their efforts to educate the public and	1906	1983.3004
What purpose can truth serve? Obviously to join with other truth in a system of ideas. There is, as it were, a sociology of thought, a cooperative commonwealth of the mind, not unlike that exhibited by human society, and strictly parallel with it in development. Now in society, where all may share in the fruits of the intellect of the few, numbers and variety are necessary; so is it also with the mind, and thus judgement is not an esoteric ability conferred at random on pensive souls, but is dependent for its very livelihood on sufficient and diverse knowledge. According to the description we have given of university functions, it must be apparent that the relation between foci of learning and public affairs is fundamental.	Institutions of higher education serve as crucibles where disparate ideas and disciplines converge, fostering an environment where intellectual synthesis can occur. This synthesis is not merely academic; it is profoundly practical, as it equips individuals with the analytical tools necessary to navigate and influence the complex realities of the modern world. Universities do not exist in a vacuum; they are inextricably linked to the society that hosts them, contributing to its cultural, economic, and political landscapes. Moreover, the pursuit of truth within these institutions is not a solitary endeavor. It is a collective enterprise, involving the interaction of students, educators, and researchers from various backgrounds and disciplines. This interaction enriches the intellectual climate, ensuring that education is not merely the transmission of established knowledge but a dynamic process of questioning, discovery, and innovation. Thus, truth serves not only the individual in their personal intellectual development but also the broader society by fostering informed citizens and innovative leaders capable of addressing the challenges of their times.	1911	2003.2236
He more than suspected that Marcia in a fit of sentimental folly would relent toward Newbury in distress; and even his rashness shrank from the possibility of a quarrel which might separate him from his sister for good. But liberate his soul he must; and he thirsted for a listener with whom to curse bigots up and down. In Marion's mild company, strangely enough, the most vigorous cursing, whether of men or institutions, had always in the end calming results. To Marion, therefore, led by a sure instinct, he went. Meanwhile the motor which passed Newbury and Coryston in the park had sped to its goal. It had already carried Arthur Coryston over half the county. That morning he had been told at the Atherstones' cottage, on his breathless arrival there, just before luncheon, that while the Chancellor had returned to town, Miss Glenwilliam had motored to a friend's house, some twenty miles north, and was not going back to London till the evening.	Arthur, driven by a mix of concern and curiosity, had immediately set off in pursuit. His mind was turbulent with thoughts of Marcia and the implications of her unexpected movements. The landscape blurred past the windows of his swiftly moving vehicle, but he scarcely noticed the rolling hills or the quaint villages slipping by. His focus was entirely on Marcia and the urgent need to speak with her, to understand her intentions and perhaps, to influence her decisions. As the motor hummed and the miles accumulated, Arthur rehearsed the conversation in his head. He knew he must tread carefully, for Marcia was headstrong and did not take kindly to being pressured or cajoled. Yet, he felt a responsibility, not just as her brother but as someone who deeply cared about her well-being, to ensure she wasn't making a decision she might later regret. Upon arriving at the grand estate where Miss Glenwilliam was visiting, Arthur's heart pounded with a mixture of dread and determination. He was shown into a drawing room where the late afternoon sun cast long shadows on the floor, and there he waited,	1913	1986.5485
The Sphex, that lays her eggs on caterpillars which she has carefully paralysed, is commonly regarded as a predatory insect, but she is from another point of view, an even more specialised parasite than the Ichneumon. Her sting immobilises but does not kill the active fullgrown or nearly fullgrown caterpillars, and her larvae are careful to feed in such a manner as to spare as long as possible the life of their victims. We have here merely a further extension of the maternal instincts primarily devoted exclusively to bringing about the union of the parasite with the host, to a unique and effective preparation of the host's body for easier exploitation by the parasite.	This method of provisioning not only ensures the freshness of the food but also the survival of the larvae, which are entirely dependent on the live but incapacitated caterpillar. The precision with which the Sphex performs her task is extraordinary, targeting specific nerve centers to induce paralysis without causing death. This precision suggests a complex instinctual behavior that is finely tuned to the life cycle and needs of her offspring. The Sphex’s behavior raises intriguing questions about the nature of instinct and the potential for learning and adaptation in insects. While it might appear that the Sphex has a form of understanding or foresight in her actions, it is more likely that these behaviors are genetically encoded responses, honed by natural selection over countless generations to meet the specific needs of her larvae. The evolution of such specialized predatory and parasitic strategies highlights the intricate and often brutal interdependencies that characterize much of the natural world.	1911	2005.977
Such a support permits the plants to move gently in the wind but not sufficiently to break them by its violence. It keeps the fruit off the ground and is cheap and convenient. Winter protection. Winter protection of some sort may be necessary for raspberries that are growing in severe locations. A good windbreak may be sufficient to make the difference between success and failure in growing this crop on our western prairies, but in many places in the extreme Northern states and in many parts of Colorado it is necessary to bury the canes to protect them from winter injury. This is especially true when tender kinds are grown.	To effectively bury the canes, they should be bent down to the ground after the leaves have fallen and before the severe winter frosts begin. The canes are then covered with soil, straw, or other insulating material to a depth sufficient to shield them from the coldest temperatures, usually a few inches. It is crucial to ensure that the material used is loose enough to prevent moisture accumulation, which can lead to rot, but dense enough to provide adequate insulation. In the spring, as the threat of frost passes, the canes are gradually uncovered and raised back to their upright positions. This process must be done carefully to avoid snapping the canes, which can weaken the plant and reduce the forthcoming season's yield. This method of winter protection is labor-intensive but often necessary to ensure the survival and productivity of raspberry plants in harsh climates. Additionally, mulching around the base of the plants can provide extra insulation and moisture retention, further protecting the roots from freezing temperatures and aiding in a stronger revival in spring.	1914	1971.341
"— Robert Broivning. EVERYWOMAN"" By B. O. Flower I. DURING the past few years the stage has become more and more the teacher of great truths — an educator in the higher sense of the term. Some times the wretched, conventional hypocrisy which masks corruption and injustice has been torn aside by an Ibsen, a Tolstoi or some other stern realistic teacher in such a way as to compel society to behold the cancer at the heart of civilization."	II. This new drama does not seek merely to entertain but to challenge the mind and stir the conscience. It holds up a mirror to the complexities and injustices of society, asking not just for reflection but for action. The plays of Shaw, with their biting wit and critique of social norms, also contribute to this trend, offering both a diagnosis and a prescription for the ills they expose. III. Moreover, the stage has increasingly become a platform for the voices of those marginalized by mainstream society. Women playwrights and those from minority backgrounds are beginning to find their voices heard, their stories told. Their works bring fresh perspectives and new narratives that challenge the traditional paradigms and enrich the theatrical experience. IV. Thus, the theatre is no longer just a place of escape but a forum for public discourse, a catalyst for social change. It calls upon every man and woman to question, to empathize, and to act. The stage has indeed become a powerful instrument in the education of a society, teaching not only what is but what might be.	1911	2006.9774
For both these new systems of cure were far less dangerous than allopathy, with its unbounded faith in the most deadly drugs and its heroic methods of practice. Then again, the master spirits of the new systems were less the slaves of old concepts and dogmas. They had little or no faith in the deadly heroic treatments of the older generations, while, belonging to minority schools, their physicians had to observe a degree of caution in their practice which is always necessary for the innovator who knows he has a powerful and hostile enemy watching for mistakes in order to discredit him.	This caution fostered a more attentive and personalized approach to each patient, a practice that was often lacking in the more traditional medical establishments of the time. The practitioners of these new systems were also more open to integrating a variety of healing practices, including those from folk traditions and other cultures, which further distinguished them from the staunchly rigid methods of allopathy. Moreover, the new systems emphasized the importance of prevention and the maintenance of health rather than merely the treatment of disease. This holistic view encouraged patients to consider lifestyle changes and natural remedies as part of their overall health regimen. This approach not only reduced the risks associated with the use of potent drugs but also empowered patients to take an active role in managing their health. The success of these new methodologies began to attract more attention, and as their practitioners continued to achieve positive outcomes without resorting to harsh treatments, public confidence in these alternative systems grew. This shift was significant, marking a gradual but undeniable transformation in the broader landscape of medicine, where the focus began to lean towards safer, patient-centered care, and where the value of diverse medical philosophies started	1911	2005.3408
"The development thus caused produced some rows of fine new shops, which were well lighted, and it was soon found that even the good, quiet folk, who for ages had been quite satisfied with the old-fashioned, dismally lighted shops could not resist the attraction of the brilliant illumination, and forsook their old methods and customs to such an extent that the well-to-do shopkeepers on "" The Green "" were aghast at the fall in their takings. This points to a fact that all illuminating engineers must recognise, namely, that in all towns and cities the standard of illumination is always on the up grade. In shop lighting the case I have mentioned illustrates it, and shows that the customer appreciates the raised standard, and tradesmen of all kinds must vie with each other, not only to satisfy their customers, but to make the lighting of their shops an advertisement for their wares."	As the trend continues, the illumination becomes not just a means of visibility, but a key element of the shopping experience, enhancing the appeal of products and creating a welcoming atmosphere that draws in consumers. This shift towards more sophisticated lighting strategies has also led to innovations in the types of lighting used. Traditional incandescent bulbs are increasingly being replaced by more energy-efficient and longer-lasting LED lights, which also offer a wider range of color temperatures and intensities. This allows shop owners to customize their lighting to better highlight the textures and colors of their merchandise. Furthermore, the strategic placement of lights plays a crucial role. Accent lighting, for instance, can be used to focus customer attention on high-value products, while ambient lighting enhances the overall mood of the shop. The use of dynamic lighting systems that can change according to the time of day or the season is another emerging trend, adapting the shopping environment to various customer moods and needs. In essence, as urban centers grow and consumer expectations evolve, the role of lighting in retail settings has transcended basic utility. It has become an essential component of retail marketing,	1912	2007.305
The establishing of this principle in the incorporated provisions of the budget is one of the most profoundly momentous victories for fundamental justice that has been won in government since the democratic era. Monopoly in land, hereditary privilege and law bulwarked favouritism are all inimical to the property rights, the happiness and the highest development of the people as a whole. Something of the result of this trinity of injustice is seen in England today. Here, with a population of many millions — a number so great that there is not more than one acre to the citizen, ten thousand privileged persons own four-fifths of all the land; and largely because of this injustice, the mother country contains, even in ordinary times, two million unemployed. When business is stagnant and times are hard, this number is greatly augmented.	The recent measures, therefore, aim to redistribute the burden of taxation more equitably and to allow for a fairer allocation of land and resources among the populace. It is believed that by breaking the stranglehold of entrenched interests, the government can foster a more dynamic and inclusive economy. This shift in policy is not merely a matter of economic expediency; it is a moral imperative, rooted in the principles of equality and justice. The new budgetary provisions include increased taxes on unearned income and inheritance, progressive land taxes, and stronger regulations against speculative land holdings. These are designed to prevent the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few and to encourage the productive use of land. Furthermore, initiatives to support smallholders, tenant farmers, and urban workers are being introduced, aimed at providing more people with the opportunity to own or responsibly use land. This reformative approach has stirred considerable debate. Proponents argue that these changes are essential for the creation of a more balanced society, where opportunity and prosperity are accessible to a larger segment of the population. Critics, however, claim that such interventions are	1911	1983.3676
"There are hundreds of girls in London — one might even say thousands — who, after trying the typical "" lodgings, "" come to the conclusion that anything is preferable to the slovenly landlady, the poor and badly served food, and, more often than not, the shabbiness and untidy appearance of their rooms, and, above all, their own great loneliness and need of companionship. All these things tend to make them very dissatisfied with the existing conditions, and, accordingly, they make their way to the nearest YWCA. Few people, unless they have experienced it, can in any way imagine 'the awful loneliness and almost sense of desolation which every girl has to bear when she leaves the shelter of her home for the first time, and begins to fight the battle of life for herself."	The YWCA becomes a haven where warmth, cleanliness, and a sense of community can be found. It offers not just lodging, but a shared experience with others in similar situations. There, the girls find not only a bed, but classes, socials, and workshops which help to foster personal growth and career skills. It is a place where they can form friendships, receive guidance, and gain the confidence needed to navigate the complexities of urban life. Moreover, the organization provides a structured support system that includes counseling services and spiritual guidance, which many find essential when coping with the pressures and challenges of living independently. The atmosphere is one of nurturing and empowerment, encouraging each member to pursue her ambitions with the solidarity of a community behind her. This shift from a lonely, disheartening existence to one of camaraderie and support marks a significant transformation in the lives of these young women. It becomes clear that the YWCA does more than just house; it revitalizes spirits and rekindles hope, proving itself to be an indispensable sanctuary in the heart of the city.	1911	2006.431
The purpose also is to show if possible the importance of greater knowledge of what is best for individual welfare on the part of homemakers to whom is entrusted the first and early care of the potential citizen or the social personality with its varied phenomena of vitality, mentality, morality and sociality. Vitality is fundamental. Without good health we can not expect the highest mental development. Without good health and the vital conditions which produce it we can not expect a high morality. Without good health and the sense of well being which accompanies it, we can not expect a deep sense of sociality or social sympathy. Two factors operate to produce vitality, i. e., heredity and hygiene. Within the limits of this paper heredity has no place.	Hygiene, however, is a subject that can be discussed, controlled, and improved through education and practice. The home, as the primary environment of the young citizen, must be a place where proper hygienic principles are not only taught but also exemplified in the daily routines and habits of its members. This includes everything from nutritional practices to the cleanliness and ventilation of the living space.  Moreover, the education of homemakers should encompass knowledge of basic health care, the importance of physical exercise, and the psychological well-being of family members. The role of a homemaker is critical in instilling routines that promote a healthy lifestyle, which in turn supports mental and emotional development. Mental alertness and emotional stability are closely linked to physical health, and a homemaker well-versed in these aspects can significantly influence the overall well-being of the family. Additionally, understanding the impact of a healthy environment on moral and social behaviors is essential. A person who feels physically well and secure is more likely to exhibit positive social behaviors and ethical conduct. Therefore, homemakers play a pivotal role in nurturing not just the	1911	1992.6346
"(5) This decree is to be published in all towns and villages in the Province of East Anglia. Count VON SCHONBURG waldenburg, Lieutenant-General, Governor of German East Anglia. Ipswich, September 6, 1910. COPY OF ONE OF THE ENEMY's PROCLAMATIONS.  "" I asked the sergeant how long he thought it would be before the Germans succeeded in crossing it. ' Bless you, sir, I expect they're over by now he answered. ' They would be sure to have their bridging companies somewhere close up, and it would not take them more than an hour or two to throw a bridge over that place The bridges at Boxted Mill and Nayland had been destroyed previously. ""The railway bridge and the other one at Manning tree were blown up before the Germans could get a footing, and their defenders had come in by rail."	Nevertheless, the resilience of the German forces was notable. They swiftly mobilized additional troops and engineering units from the rear, pressing forward with a determination that was chilling in its efficiency. By nightfall, temporary pontoon bridges were being laid across narrower sections of the river, enabling their infantry to cross in steady streams under the cover of darkness. In the dim light of dawn, the sound of heavy machinery and the clanking of metal resonated through the air as the engineers worked tirelessly. The locals watched from their hiding places, a mix of fear and awe striking their hearts as they witnessed the precision of the enemy's movements. The once quiet countryside was now a hub of military activity, with the German command establishing temporary headquarters in nearby farmhouses and requisitioning vehicles and supplies from the villagers. As the day progressed, reports came in of skirmishes along the riverbank. The local defense forces, comprised mostly of volunteers and a few remaining regulars, fought bravely but were often outmatched by the superior numbers and firepower of the German troops. Despite their efforts, the enemy slowly but steadily gained	1906	1969.6674
It animals it has been observed that orientation toward the centre of gravity of the earth often becomes less compulsory when the inner ear has been removed. Mach first pointed out the possibility that the otoliths are responsible for this. They might press upon the end organs of the sensory nerves and every change of pressure might cause a correction of the position of the animal. It is generally assumed that this view has been verified by experiment. I cannot, however, agree with this, although I once described experiments which seemed to support Mich's otolith theory.	Upon further reflection and additional experimentation, I have come to believe that the role of the otoliths in orientation and balance is more complex than initially thought. Indeed, while it is clear that they do contribute to these processes, other factors within the vestibular system also play critical roles. The semicircular canals, for example, are essential in detecting rotational movements, working in conjunction with the otoliths to provide a comprehensive sense of spatial orientation. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that sensory hair cells within the otolith organs do not merely respond to mechanical pressure, but also to the shear forces generated by tilting and linear accelerations. This indicates a more dynamic interaction between these sensory structures and the neural mechanisms they inform. Thus, while the otolith theory proposed by Mach provides a valuable framework, it is clear that our understanding of vestibular function must incorporate a broader perspective, acknowledging the intricate interplay of multiple sensory and neural components. This holistic view is crucial in advancing our comprehension of how animals, including humans, maintain balance and orientation in a complex and changing environment.	1911	2007.0929
Again, as attorney for the express companies, he is master of the subject and his study of it has been from the view point of advantage, not to the American people, not to the Postoffice Department, but to his clients that have so long prevented the people from enjoying the blessings of a parcels post such as all other civilised peoples enjoy, and that, with the railroads, have been the major cause of the postal deficit that has been for so many years one of the gravest scandals of the executive department of the national government. Under these circumstances, it is clearly to be seen that this man, by virtue of his superior knowledge of the subject and his long familiarity with the same as special pleader for express monopolies, will present in a powerful manner their side of the case.	It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to scrutinize his arguments with particular care, for they are likely to be both subtle and persuasive. We must also be vigilant in ensuring that the interests of the public are not eclipsed by the well-articulated concerns of a vested minority. The challenge before us is to disentangle the genuine public interest from the special interests that have so skillfully woven themselves into the fabric of our postal policies. As we consider the future of our postal services, we must remember that the primary objective of such a service should be to serve the public efficiently and equitably. We must question whether the continuation of policies favorable to express companies, at the expense of a potentially beneficial national parcels post, truly serves the common good. The establishment of a parcels post could democratize access to nationwide shipping, reduce costs for small businesses and consumers, and potentially alleviate the financial burdens on our postal system. Let us approach this debate with a clear understanding of the stakes involved, and with a commitment to ensuring that our postal policies are crafted not only with an eye to the past and present	1911	1937.9806

Broadly speaking prices are high in the north, lower in Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands, and rise again in the South and East. To obtain the resultant cost of living the index numbers of rents and prices are combined Rent is given a weight of 1 and prices of 4. London (100) is at the head of the list because of its high rents, Croydon (99) is high because of its proximity to London, Dover (96) is third because of its high prices (106, while its rent is 56). The broad result is to show that there is very little difference between the majority of towns with regard to the cost of living. thirty-eight of the seventy three towns are included in the range between 85 and 90, and fifty-two between that of 84 and 92. The cost of clothing, which was included in the 1904 table given above, is not mentioned. In order to compare the weekly rates of wages, four trades were chosen which are represented in nearly all of the towns — building, engineering, printing (hand compositors only), and furnishing.	The average wage in these industries varies significantly across regions, reflecting the cost of living differences. For instance, wages in the building trade are generally higher in London and the South East compared to the Midlands or the North, aligning with the higher cost of living in these areas. Similarly, engineering wages are notably higher in industrial hubs like Manchester and Birmingham, where the demand for skilled labor is greater due to the concentration of factories and heavy industries. The printing industry shows less variation in wages, possibly due to the uniformity of skills required across locations and the less physical nature of the work compared to building or engineering. However, in furnishing, where craftsmanship and artistry play significant roles, wages can vary widely, often reflecting the economic health and cultural investment of the area. This wage data, when overlaid with the cost of living index, provides a more nuanced understanding of real income and economic conditions in different parts of the country. Workers in areas with high wages but also high living costs may not necessarily enjoy a better standard of living than those in regions with lower wages and costs. This disparity often drives	1908	1985.5367
"They remain to work. All of her work is done, I believe, by tramps. The town has protested in various ways, thinking it makes a centre for them. It did no good. She has taken her way in all things, and in this."" ""But I think that's a splendid thing for her to do! She makes them work, doesn't she — really work ?"" "" Oh yes.

She's not just giving them work; she's giving them respect, a sense of worth."" ""Yes, and it's that which rehabilitates them more than the physical labor. It's the acknowledgment that they can contribute, that they are not beyond redemption. It’s transformative."" They walked on in silence for a moment, each lost in thought. Then, breaking the quiet, ""Do many in the town see it her way, or is she still fighting an uphill battle?"" ""Sadly, it’s still an uphill battle. Many can't see past their prejudices. They see her actions as encouraging dependency, or worse, inviting crime. But she persists, undeterred by their narrow views."" ""It’s always the way with"	1913	1975.4843
The Kayans of Borneo maintain that self murderers are sent to a place called Tan Tekkan, where they will be very poor and wretched, subsisting on leaves, roots, or anything they can pick up in the forests, and being easily distinguished by their miserable appearance. According to Dyak beliefs, they go to a special place, where those who have  drowned themselves must henceforth live up to their waists in water, and those who have poisoned themselves must live in houses built of poisonous woods and surrounded by noxious plants, the exhalations of which are painful to the spirits. In other instances we are simply told that the souls of suicides, together with those of persons who have been killed in war, or who have died a violent death, are not permitted to live with the rest of the souls, to whom their presence would cause uneasiness.	This segregation of souls is not unique to the Dyaks; similar beliefs can be found among various cultures across the globe, each with its own specifics about the afterlife conditions for those who end their lives prematurely or violently. Among the ancient Greeks, for instance, it was believed that those who took their own lives would not be allowed to cross the river Styx, thus denying them peaceful rest in the underworld and subjecting them to a shadowy existence on its fringes. In Japan, the notion of yūrei, or spirits with strong emotional ties to the living world, includes those who have died in anguish or turmoil, such as through suicide. These spirits are often thought to linger, unable to move on due to the unresolved nature of their deaths. Similarly, among some Native American tribes, there is a belief that those who die by suicide are doomed to wander the earth as restless spirits, unable to join their ancestors in the afterlife until they have rectified the imbalance caused by their premature departure. These cultural narratives around the treatment of suicides in the afterlife reflect a broader societal perspective on	1908	1997.2015
However, rejected it was, and those of us who believe in the cause have now to ask ourselves what are the real reasons which led to this result. I do not believe it could for a moment be argued that militant tactics had very much to do with the result. It is quite possible that a dozen or so votes were influenced by that. Even were it so, however, nothing more mean could have been done. For men to say that because, in their judgement, some people have committed illegal acts and done things they ought not to do, and that because of this they will vote against a thing which they honestly believe in, is quite too silly to argue about at this time of day.	It seems more likely that the real reasons for rejection lay deeper, perhaps in a general lack of understanding or fear of change. Many may have doubted the readiness of society to embrace such changes, or feared the repercussions that such a shift might bring. Others might have been swayed by misinformation or swayed by the voices of prominent opponents who had their own agendas or biases. It is also possible that some voters were simply indifferent, not fully grasping the significance of what was at stake or the impact their vote could have. In any case, those of us who support the cause must take this as a learning opportunity. We need to better communicate the benefits and address the fears associated with our proposals. We must strive to educate and engage with the public more effectively, ensuring that misinformation is countered and that the real and substantial merits of our cause are clearly and compellingly presented. Only through persistent effort and renewed commitment can we hope to overcome the obstacles before us and achieve the progress we believe in.	1911	1996.5421
"„ „ r , , , . If the more exact value g - is adopted for the bending moment in the line of loading the maximum stress intensity becomes 16 — 1 tne (jifference being under z percent. 7T irr2 1-0294 ^V37rr"" even in this extreme case of curvature.

If y = 1 tonne and the steel is 1 inch diameter, the maximum intensity of stress is = 6-3 tonnes Per square inch.

XII. 16 W The value — — j is 33 percent. greater than this."	This discrepancy highlights the necessity of considering curvature effects in the calculation of bending stresses, particularly when dealing with curved beams or arcs. The typical assumption of straight beam behavior can lead to significant underestimation of stress intensities, which might compromise the structural integrity in practical engineering applications. To further illustrate, let us consider the implications of these calculations on design decisions. For engineers, acknowledging the increase in stress intensity due to curvature means that the design of curved beams requires more robust materials or additional support compared to straight beams under similar loads. This could involve choosing materials with higher tensile strength, implementing thicker beam sections, or employing strategic reinforcement to distribute stresses more evenly. Moreover, the engineering codes and standards may need to incorporate these considerations to ensure safety and functionality. For curved beams, it might be prudent to develop specific clauses that address the unique stress distributions and recommend appropriate safety factors. In conclusion, the analysis of curved beams presents a complex challenge that deviates significantly from the simpler cases of straight beams. Accurate modeling of these scenarios is crucial for the development of safe and efficient structural designs, necessitating a deep	1908	2005.7887
Every exposure has been heralded far and wide, and has excited a desire in every town, village and hamlet to turn Up and root out corruption of every kind and description. In addition to this development of a more sensitive conscience, due in turn to the development of the means of intercommunication and to the emulation and competition which have sprung up between localities to have done with the grafters, we must remember that for the first time in the whole history of the world public administration is being conducted in the full light of publicity. In Europe, even in those countries where the press is freest, the public servants have been sheltered, and for the most part are still completely concealed from public observation. Government in most European countries is conducted by a sort of gentlemen's agreement.	In the United States, however, a different tradition has evolved. Here, the press and public hold a vigilant watch over the actions of those in power, demanding transparency and accountability at every turn. This relentless scrutiny has become a fundamental aspect of American democracy, fostering an environment where corruption is much less likely to take root unnoticed. As a result, the American public has developed an acute awareness of the workings of their government, and a keen intolerance for misconduct. This cultural shift towards transparency and accountability has been significantly aided by the rapid advancements in technology and communication. The proliferation of newspapers, radio broadcasts, and more recently, the internet, has ensured that information is widely and swiftly disseminated, leaving little room for corrupt practices to hide. This transformation has not been without its challenges. The increased exposure can sometimes lead to sensationalism, where the media might prioritize scandal over substance, potentially leading to public cynicism and distrust. Nonetheless, the overall effect has been overwhelmingly positive, creating a more informed and engaged citizenry capable of holding their leaders to account. Thus, while Europe continues to operate under a more opaque	1911	2000.0565
Such copying activity has been the object of careful psychological analysis in recent years. Many thousands of school children of various ages have been asked to draw  299   definite things which are familiar to them, an animal, a carriage, a church, or to render a thing which they see before them, a cube or a table or a landscape; and both the extreme individual differences and the differences of age and of training have been carefully analysed. We know that the youngest children do not draw at all what they have seen but that they give graphic expression to what they know concerning the thing, and thus combine in their picture elements which are never seen together. Moreover, we know that their interest belongs essentially to disconnected detail. Slowly the state is reached where real impressions are controlling the drawing more and more and where at least the outlines correspond to the appearance while the depth, the shadows, the foreshortening are still neglected and falsified.	As children grow older and receive more formal instruction in art, their ability to observe and replicate the finer details of perspective, shading, and proportion improves significantly. The educational system plays a crucial role in this development, introducing more complex concepts of spatial relationships and light interaction as they progress through their schooling years. This systematic approach helps refine their raw, intuitive grasp of drawing into a more accurate and technically adept skill. By adolescence, many students are able to produce drawings that not only capture the basic form but also the mood and atmosphere of the subject. This maturity in drawing parallels cognitive and perceptual growth, where abstract thinking and better motor coordination allow for more sophisticated artistic expressions. Furthermore, exposure to various artistic styles and historical art movements broadens their understanding and appreciation, influencing their own creative outputs. Educators have noted that this progression is not linear and can be highly variable depending on individual aptitude, interest in art, and the quality of art education provided. Some students may excel in creating realistic, highly detailed drawings, while others may adopt a more stylized or abstract approach, indicating that personal style also begins	1909	2007.6594

"It is easy to reason after the facts have been clearly stated; hence the following prelude to the study of the relation of clothing to colds, pneumonia and consumption. We observe that practically all illnesses are ushered in by what is commonly called a cold; but what is not appreciated as it ought to be is the fact that the symptoms indicate the efforts of the system to clear itself of accumulated waste, the actual cause of disease. Mr. J. H., sixty-five, on consulting me put this question: ""Why is it, doctor, that I get a cold every fall when I put on my winter flannels?"" My explanation satisfied his mind, and, the season having been fall, instead of making the usual change he removed his summer underwear and never after wore a stitch of underclothing. He lived to be eighty five and died of old age in normal fashion, so to say."	This case, while remarkable, is not unique in my practice. It highlights a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of colds and the body's response to external conditions. The common belief that exposure to cold weather is the direct cause of colds is a misconception. Rather, it is the body's reaction to abrupt changes in environment and its own regulation processes that often trigger these symptoms.  When Mr. J.H. switched directly from light summer clothing to heavy winter garments, his body struggled to adapt to the sudden change in insulation and temperature regulation. This stress can lead to a decrease in immune function, making the body more susceptible to viruses, which are the true culprits behind colds. The lesson here is about the importance of gradual transition between seasonal clothing and understanding that the body has its own mechanisms for dealing with temperature changes. Encouraging these natural processes, rather than abruptly interfering with them, can potentially reduce the incidence of what we term as 'seasonal colds'. This does not suggest that clothing is irrelevant—indeed, appropriate dressing is crucial for comfort and overall health—but it	1911	2007.1527
But predetermined sentences and our present system of punitive imprisonment are surely incompatible with these ends. Treatment must be reformative; our prisons must become schools, colleges of decent life. And to give them a fair chance of doing their work, the periods of consignment must not be settled beforehand. Discharge must also be tentative and conditional, or probationary. We have hopeful beginnings already in our Industrial and Reformatory Schools for juveniles, and a promising experiment in the Borstal system for juvenile adults, which is to be extended and improved. But they all want improving in the indeterminate and reformatory direction — to be more indeterminate and more reformative. The judge or magistrate is not in a position to know how long it will take to cure a prisoner, or what treatment he needs. Educational experts, after close study of the individual, may be in such a position.	Thus, the establishment of a parole board or similar entity, staffed with psychologists, educators, and other specialists, would be a prudent step forward. Such boards could assess each inmate's progress and readiness for reintegration into society, determining release dates based on demonstrated rehabilitation rather than on arbitrary timelines. This approach would not only be more humane but likely more effective at reducing recidivism. Furthermore, the very architecture and routine of prisons must be transformed to support this rehabilitative model. Cells should be replaced with more open, communal living spaces that encourage social interaction and personal responsibility. Programs for education, vocational training, and therapy should be expanded and made central to daily life, rather than peripheral activities.  Inmates should be encouraged to take an active role in their rehabilitation through goal setting and regular evaluations of their progress. This involvement can foster a sense of agency and purpose, which are critical for successful re-entry into society. By re-envisioning our penal institutions in this way, we can hope to not only reform individuals but also reduce the broader social costs associated with crime and incarceration.	1908	2007.0139
"Therefore, with my boy Frank, I walked along the Embankment until I got close to Waterloo Bridge, when, as I approached the great single arch that spans the roadway, I noticed a boat containing three men shoot out into the river from beneath the wall, close to where we were walking. It slipped silently beneath the shadow of the second arch, where there was some scaffolding, the fine old bridge being under repair. "" The bridge above was just as crowded as that at Blackfriars, the throng struggling both ways, meeting and fighting among themselves for the mastery. In those frantic efforts to cross the river, men and women had their clothes literally torn from their backs. The men were demons in that hour of terror ; the women became veritable furies. On the Embankment where I stood in the shadow, however, there were few persons."	Most had either gravitated toward the more populous areas in their panic or had managed to find their way into the nearby streets, hoping to discover some alternate route across the tumultuous river. The air was thick with the cries of the desperate and the sound of chaos that echoed off the walls of the massive structures surrounding us. Frank gripped my hand tightly, his small face upturned to mine with a look of concern. I squeezed his hand reassuringly, though my own heart raced with the anxiety of the scene unfolding before us. As we watched the boat glide stealthily beneath the bridge, I could not help but wonder what urgent mission drove these men to brave the waters in such perilous times. Their movements were precise, suggesting a familiarity with the task at hand, yet there was an undeniable tension in the way they scanned the dark waters around them. The boat soon disappeared into the darkness beneath the scaffolding, and the sounds of their paddling faded away, swallowed by the greater noise of the city's distress. Turning away from the river, I decided it was best to lead Frank away from	1906	2002.3354

In this same connexion of the preparation of home makers for adapting themselves and their families to their environment, charity workers agree that among working people the women who have been in domestic service are much better able to manage on their income than those who have spent their girlhood in factories Intemperance, which is known by all charity workers to be a prolific cause of crime, is often excused in its first manifestations as resulting from innutritious food. In families where the wages would be sufficient to supply nutritious food, the homemakers do not know how to buy or to prepare it."	Thus, the cycle of poverty and poor living conditions perpetuates itself, trapping families in a relentless struggle against social and economic disadvantages. This lack of knowledge, coupled with the limited financial resources, creates an environment where physical and mental health deteriorates, and the potential for upward mobility diminishes significantly. Professor Devine notes that education in basic home economics could serve as a preventive measure, equipping these individuals with the necessary skills to better manage their resources, improve their living conditions, and thereby reduce the likelihood of descending into the despair that breeds crime and disease. Moreover, the role of community support in these settings cannot be overstressed. Local initiatives aimed at providing nutritional education, budgeting assistance, and even simple cooking classes can have profound impacts. These programs not only teach essential life skills but also foster a sense of community and support among participants, offering a buffer against the isolation that so often accompanies poverty. In summary, the challenges faced by these unprepared homemakers are multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive approach that includes education, community support, and changes in social policies to address the root causes of poverty	1911	2004.534
"Newbury, too, had grown a little pale and silent. But when his eyes met hers there was that in them under which her own wavered. "" Come and see the flowers in the wood, "" he said, softly, and, leading the way, he took her out of range of those observers in the garden, deep into a noble beechwood that rose out of the garden, climbing through a sea of wild hyacinths to a hilltop. A mossy path offered itself, winding through the blue; and round them closed the great beech' trees, in a marvel of young green, sparkling and quivering under the shafts of light that struck through the wood. The air was balm. And the low music of the wood pigeons seemed to be there for them only — a chorus of earth's creatures, wooing them to earth's festival. Unconsciously, in the deep heart of the wood, their footsteps slackened. She heard her name breathed. "" Marcia!"" She turned, submissive, and saw him looking down upon her with adoring tenderness, his lips gravely smiling. ""Yes!"""	"Newbury reached out and gently took her hand, his touch as delicate as the breeze that rustled the beech leaves above. ""Marcia, I have longed for this moment, to be alone with you amidst the stillness of nature, where nothing can overshadow the sincerity of my words."" His voice was earnest, filled with an emotion that resonated deeply within her. Marcia felt her heart flutter, a mix of anticipation and nervousness. The serene beauty of their surroundings, the secluded wood bathed in dappled sunlight, seemed to echo the intensity of the moment. ""You have brought so much light into my life,"" he continued, his eyes never leaving hers. ""I find myself thinking of you in quiet moments, wondering how I ever managed before you stepped into my world."" She could feel the warmth of his hand, the earnestness in his gaze, and something within her melted. This was not the grand declaration of a drawing-room romance; it was more profound, more genuine.

The results from this work are seldom well marked in the crossed fruit although the skilful operator may sometimes be able to see it. But the results of the cross will show in the seedlings from the crossed fruit and it must not be expected that the seedlings will partake equally of the nature of each, for we know from much experience that the results of such crosses are uncertain and irregular. Pollination. Under natural conditions flowers are pollen Ized in various ways, but chiefly by wind, in the case of plants that have inconspicuous flowers such as corn, pine, spruce and poplar; and by insects in our cultivated fruits and most other plants which have conspicuous flowers. Some flowers are probably pollenized in both ways. Hybrids.	The creation of hybrids, whether intentional or accidental, presents a fascinating study of genetic variability and inheritance. The hybrid offspring often exhibit characteristics intermediate between the parent species, but can also display new traits not found in either parent, a phenomenon known as hybrid vigor or heterosis. This can result in greater disease resistance, increased growth rates, and other beneficial qualities, making hybrids highly valuable in both agriculture and horticulture. However, not all hybrids are successful. Some may suffer from reduced fertility or other genetic disadvantages that can limit their survival and reproduction. This inconsistency in hybrid success underscores the complexity of genetic interactions that occur during the process of crossbreeding. In the garden and the laboratory, hybridization requires careful selection and breeding practices to ensure the desired traits are enhanced while minimizing any deleterious effects. This often involves multiple generations of crossing back to one of the parent species to stabilize desirable characteristics while weeding out undesirable ones. Through such meticulous efforts, breeders can develop new plant varieties that contribute to the diversity and resilience of our agricultural systems.	1914	2007.2668
"A kind of succession has been postulated by some modern thinkers, as Tarde and Baldwin, which is intended to exhibit the machinery of transmission, finding this to consist in the principle of imitation. But to my thinking, these writers err on the side of over emphasis, leaving no room for the true historical continuity of ideas. Imitation does play its part in the higher stages of intelligent learning and transmission that we have attempted to delimit. But if a custom propagates itself by imitation, a scientific idea involves rational receptiveness. It being clear that transmission cannot be fully described in intellectualistic terms, we are under the necessity of finding to what extent other factors participate. We have, so to speak, two parallel lines of succession; that represented by the biological term ""heredity, "" as well as the line of tradition that has been under consideration."	The interplay between these two is complex and often overlooked. Heredity provides the substrate, the biological predispositions that shape our capacities and inclinations, while tradition offers the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of previous generations, transmitted culturally rather than genetically. This duality is crucial in understanding human development, as neither heredity nor tradition operates in isolation.  Indeed, while heredity equips us with certain potentials and predispositions, it is tradition that molds these raw capacities into fully formed faculties. It is through tradition that language, art, science, and moral systems are passed down and refined, allowing each generation to build upon the achievements of its predecessors. Thus, while imitation may serve as a mechanism in this cultural transmission, it is far from the sole process at work. Moreover, it is essential to recognize the role of innovation within tradition. Each individual, while inheriting a cultural legacy, also contributes to it, potentially altering the trajectory of cultural evolution. This dynamic interaction between the inherited and the acquired, between tradition and innovation, forms the crucible in which individual and collective identity are forged	1908	1993.7062

The Statute of Frauds, for instance, requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, such as contracts for the sale of land, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, and contracts for the sale of goods over a certain value. This statute aims to prevent fraud and perjury by requiring a written agreement or some memorandum or note thereof to be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Consideration, the legal term for the value exchanged in a contract, must be present for a contract to be legally binding. It can be a promise to perform a certain action, a promise to refrain from doing something, or the exchange of money	1913	1954.0386
As these are not banks of issue, but banks of deposit, loan and discount only, the bonding feature is believed to be adequate protection. The net discount earnings from these 7,145 subsidiary banks, would be startling, impressive and conclusive evidence that the general welfare clause, rightly considered and enforced, supplements and reinforces the purpose to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. The revenue from discounts alone, now flowing into the coffers of private and corporate interests, would flow into the national treasury to reduce and in time wholly liquidate the expenses of the national government. Such a consummation would solve the tariff isue, limited to the protection of home industries as against the incursions of the older civilizations which do not yet subscribe to fundamental democracy and the brotherhood of man. We thus secure: 1. A homogeneous national currency, responsive to the jurisdiction. 2. A money medium that is a legal tender, both of coin and currency. 3.	A direct control over inflation and deflation, allowing for a more stable economic environment. 4. A reduction in the cost of government borrowing, as the national treasury can access funds at lower interest rates directly from the central reserve rather than through private banks. 5. Enhanced fiscal capabilities to address socio-economic disparities through targeted public spending without the necessity to over-rely on tax increases. This system of national banks serving as repositories for the public wealth ensures that the financial benefits derived from the nation's economic activities are returned to the populace rather than accruing to a select few. It democratizes financial power, aligning it with the principles of a representative democracy and ensuring that it serves the broad public interest. Moreover, by eliminating the profit motive from our banking system, we reduce the risk of speculative financial bubbles that can lead to devastating economic crises. This model promotes a more prudent and sustainable approach to financial management, emphasizing long-term stability over short-term gains. Such reforms would not only reinforce the economic foundations of our nation but also affirm our commitment to a more equitable society where the economic system operates not just	1911	1988.4221
From noting an anomaly of such importance the student is led to consider the causes of it, and so discovers that London has, for certain reasons which I will now describe, not only occupied a special position in all the military history of England, but very largely determined the fate of every struggle fought out upon the soil of this island. In the first place, London always had and continues to have a numerical position of an extraordinary kind. It accounts today for   something like a sixth of the population. It has often in the past accounted for a similar proportion of the population of its day. It has never had less than one tenth of England within its boundaries, so far as we can estimate the numbers of the past.	Moreover, London's geographical position on the River Thames has made it a strategic point of immense importance. The river provides a natural barrier against invasion from the south, while also serving as a major conduit for trade and supplies. Historically, control of London meant control of the river, and thus control of the economic lifeblood of the region. In military terms, London has often been the prize in conflicts due to its economic and political significance. During the English Civil War, for example, both Royalists and Parliamentarians understood that possession of London could significantly influence the outcome of the war. The city's robust defenses and its ability to sustain a large population made it a formidable stronghold. Furthermore, London's role as the political center of England, housing the main institutions of government, has added to its strategic importance. The city's capture or defense has often been synonymous with control of the country. This was vividly demonstrated during the Norman Conquest when William the Conqueror made it a priority to secure London, thereby consolidating his hold on England. Thus, London’s unique combination of demographic concentration,	1912	1976.3378
doubt. Man, in spite of his obvious duty to the contrary, would continue so often not to preserve himself, not to nourish himself and to prove resistant to the blandishments of sex, that the attempt to squeeze his behaviour into these three categories began to involve an increasingly obvious and finally intolerable amount of pushing and pulling, as well as so much pretence that he was altogether ' in, ' when, quite plainly, so large a part of him remained ' out, ' that the enterprise had to be given up and it was once more discovered that man escaped and must always escape any complete generalisation by science.	This discovery, while it frustrated the efforts of those who sought to define man in narrow, absolutist terms, also opened up a more nuanced understanding of human nature. It revealed the complexity and the inherent contradictions within individuals, which defy reduction to simple formulas. The richness of human experience, with its interplay of rationality and irrationality, self-preservation and self-destruction, desire and aversion, suggests that any attempt to categorize humanity must accommodate vast and varied spectra of behaviors and motivations. Philosophers and psychologists began to argue that the essence of humanity lies not in predictable patterns but in the capacity for unpredictability, the ability to act against instinctual drives or societal expectations. This capacity for transcendence, for acting in ways that seem contrary to immediate biological or psychological interests, is seen as uniquely human. It challenges the deterministic views of behavior and opens up a realm where freedom and ethics start to play a significant role in shaping human actions. Thus, the study of man shifted from a focus on trying to fit human behavior into rigid frameworks, to an exploration of the complexities that constitute human	1908	2003.7574
"For, while it does not elevate the traffic to the level of legitimate business, it practically removes all restraints upon it, except such as may be imposed by special legislation. Since 1883 the business has been taxed to provide against evils resulting from it — and the business pays the tax with the understanding that the tax operates as a licence. It is probable, however, that the liquor interests prefer licence; but rather than meet the voters on a square issue, they are willing to play the same trick in 1911 and 1912 that they played in 1850-51, for at that time they adroitly argued that a vote in favour of prohibiting licence would operate ambiguously: temperance people would vote ""No licence, "" supposing that ""No licence"" meant no saloon; and anti temperance people would vote ""No licence, "" knowing that ""No licence"" meant free whiskey. And so the ""No licence"" article was adopted and has been a barrier from the beginning to all consistent liquor legislation.

The institution of a more comprehensive and effective public health system. This would include the establishment of local health departments in every county, tasked with not only preventing the spread of diseases but also promoting general health awareness among the population. It is essential that such departments have the authority to enforce health regulations effectively and are equipped with the necessary resources to carry out their duties. 4. The reform of the educational system to ensure equal access to quality education for all children, regardless of their economic background. This would involve increased funding for public schools, the implementation of modern teaching methods, and the provision of necessary educational materials. Additionally, this reform would aim to reduce class sizes and ensure that all schools are staffed with well-trained, adequately paid teachers. 5. The implementation of stricter environmental protection laws to safeguard Ohio’s natural resources for future generations. This includes stricter regulations on industrial pollution, incentives for businesses to adopt greener practices, and enhanced conservation efforts to preserve the state’s forests, waterways, and wildlife. Each of these reforms is crucial for the progress and well-being of Ohio’s citizens, and it is imperative	1911	1986.0438

Two of his family were down with the disease (influenza fever) and he found himself on the verge of an attack. The season was mid winter, and after an unseasonably warm spell of weather (always the precursor of grip epidemic), it had turned cold and a snowstorm was on. Dr. Winternitz donned his walking boots and plunged out into the night and tramped for two hours until he was in a free perspiration, when he returned home, took a good rub down with a dry towel, and went to bed, to waken in the morning absolutely free from the disease with which he was threatened the night before. I will remark that in the dress reform so essential for preventing pneumonia and other diseases, there is no occasion for adopting the Greek costume nor any fantastic garb a la Duncan, in order to meet the requirements for skin breathing.	Rather, it is the adjustment and choice of suitable materials and the avoidance of excessive layering that play crucial roles. Clothing should permit the skin to breathe and maintain a proper balance of warmth and ventilation. Wool, being a natural fiber, provides excellent insulation while allowing moisture to escape, which makes it an ideal choice for undergarments during the colder months. Similarly, cotton, with its breathable properties, is appropriate for warmer climates. Moreover, the fit of the clothing is equally important. Garments that are too tight restrict movement and can hinder circulation, while overly loose clothing may fail to provide sufficient warmth or protection against the elements. It is about finding a middle ground where the clothing supports bodily functions without constraining them. In addition to clothing choices, regular physical activity, like that undertaken by Dr. Winternitz, is vital in enhancing circulation and bolstering the immune system, thus providing a natural defense against respiratory ailments. Such holistic approaches to health, combining appropriate dress and physical vigor, are indispensable in the fight against seasonal diseases.	1911	2001.0702
Hadn'T Erlcort a duty to perform in preventing his going back to the bad? Refuse this markedly improved fiction, and you drove him to writing nothing but best sellers from now on. He urged Erlcort to reflect. They had a jolly time, and the ex best - seller went away in high spirits, prophesying that Erlcort would come to his fiction yet. There were authors who did not leave Erlcort so cheerful when they failed to see their books on his shelves or tables. Some of them were young authors who had written their worthless books with a devout faith in their worth, and they went away more in sorrow than in anger, and yet more in bewilderment.	Erlcort, ever the conscientious bookseller, felt a pang of regret each time he had to turn away these hopeful scribes. He understood the heartbreak that often came with rejection, the crushing blow to one’s ego and aspirations. Yet, he maintained a firm belief in curating his collection with integrity, ensuring that each book he stocked held some merit in literary quality or unique appeal. It was a delicate balance to maintain—encouraging young talent while upholding standards.  At times, he would take the extra step of offering gentle, constructive criticism, hoping to guide these young authors towards improvement. He believed in the potential of every writer to grow and often recommended resources, workshops, or even connected them with more experienced mentors from his network.  For Erlcort, the bookstore was not just a place of business, but a hub of community and culture, a nurturing ground for the literary arts. He held a silent promise to himself and to his patrons to foster a space where both literature and its creators could thrive, even if it meant making the hard decisions that occasionally	1913	2000.0758
In other words, the fact of the sterility of hybrids, and certain other purely factual considerations, were urged by Buffon as conclusive objections against the theory of descent. Specifically, his arguments against evolution are three: (1) Within recorded history no new true species (in his own sense of the term) have been known to appear. (2) There is one entirely definite and constant line of demarcation between species: it is that indicated by the infertility of hybrids. This is the most fixed point that we possess in natural history. No other resemblances or differences among living beings are so constant or so real or so certain.	(3) The constancy of species is further demonstrated by the persistence of specific traits over time, even under varied environmental conditions. Buffon argued that while individual organisms may adapt or exhibit slight variations, these changes do not accumulate to form new species. Thus, according to Buffon, the stability of species over time and the infertility of hybrids serve as irrefutable evidence against the theory of descent with modification. These arguments, while persuasive to some during his era, were later challenged as the field of genetics advanced and the mechanisms of inheritance became better understood. The discovery of DNA and the understanding of genetic mutation and recombination provided clear mechanisms for the variability and heritability of traits that could lead to speciation. Moreover, the fossil record began to be recognized as a crucial source of data for understanding the gradual changes in species over vast periods, offering tangible evidence of the very processes Buffon had declared impossible.	1911	2001.1185
"To grasp the profound import of this staggeringly intricate and yet simple query one has only to bear in mind that the feelings which moved the uncouth Devonshire peasants in Philpott's play are common to the whole of mankind, the overwhelmingly majority of whom have to toil for their daily bread in similar monotony, and surrounded by equally rigid boundaries from which escape is impossible, and whose outlook is equally limited. Can it be wondered at that men seem dull and gloomy if there be brought to mind the ghastly array of "" moral "" sufferings, which have terrorised "" God's Image "" ever since the formulation of principles of guidance wholly opposed to the innermost cravings of human nature ? How could civilisation become anything other than a mockery, when it was destroying life's most precious attribute: the joy of life itself ? Is it not natural that under such circumstances we alone amongst all living beings should consider life such a burden that our greatest thinkers try to look behind the screen instead of occupying themselves with the immeasurable opportunities which life offers ?"	Indeed, the tragedy of the human condition, as depicted in the arts and literature, reflects this deep-seated discontent. The peasant in Philpott's play, like countless others across the epochs and continents, embodies this struggle against an existence defined by labor and limitation. Yet, this condition also serves as a fertile ground for philosophical inquiry and artistic expression. The very act of questioning the value and purpose of life, of peering behind the veil of mundane existence, is a testament to the unique capacity of human beings to transcend their immediate circumstances. This philosophical and artistic endeavor, while it may seem a diversion from the practicalities of life, actually enriches it, offering both solace and a challenge. It pushes individuals to confront and, potentially, to redefine the parameters of their existence. Thus, while the query about life's burdens may seem to underline a bleak view of civilization, it also highlights the indomitable spirit of inquiry and resilience that characterizes humanity. The greatest thinkers and artists have not merely succumbed to despair but have used their insights to illuminate the paths towards understanding and, perhaps	1911	1971.5612

"In order to make a comparison between the relative illuminating value of high and low candle power units, it is necessary to take a definite length of platform into consideration ; therefore, in the following table, this has been put at 1,000ft. The height of the lamps is stated as the height above the photometer screen, which must be added to the ""height mentioned in order to calculate the height above the platform. It naturally follows that the width of the platform which would be illuminated to the minimum extent is equal to half the distance between the lamps. Thus, in the case of A, for example, this would be 10 ft., or 5 ft. on either side of the line of lamps. A general analysis of the above table goes to show that when the distance apart of the lamps exceeds 60 ft.,  28 and it is intended to use high candlepower lamps, these must be at least twice as efficient as the smaller units in order to obtain the same results at the same cost. For instance, supposing examples A, B, C, and D were carried out by means of low pressure gas mantles or tungsten electric lamps, therefore the electric flame lamps might be favourably considered under Scheme I., but in order to get satisfactory results and keep the extremes of illumination within the prescribed limits, it would be necessary to use high current lamps with dioptric or similar light deflecting globes.

However, it should also be noted that higher CP units might require more sophisticated technology and infrastructure, which could initially increase the cost. In addition to the cost-effectiveness and practicality of lamp arrangement, other factors such as the color temperature of the light, its distribution pattern, and the overall impact on	1912	1988.3976
Use of Photographs as Evidence. — Photographic views should be taken from selected positions, which, if sworn to as being true representations of what they profess to be, may be introduced in evidence The value of photographic views cannot be overestimated. They are invaluable in case of destruction of buildings or other structures by wind, ﬂood, or ﬁre. They are much easier to comprehend than are maps or plans by jurymen, and they are quite difficult of misrepresentation, and are now generally accepted as evidence. They show elevations and depressions, distances and shapes as they naturally appear to the eye, and are more convincing to both jury and judge. They are quickly and cheaply made, and are comprehensible to the most uneducated and unskilled, and are received for nearly all purposes and in all cases where the original object cannot be had.

568 THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY PROTOZOAN GERM PLASM BY Professor GARY N. CALKINS COLOMBIA UNIVERSITY IN his classical essays on the nature of the germ plasm, Weismann, more than twenty years ago, drew a distinction between that protoplasm destined for the perpetuation of the race and that needed by the organism for its ordinary functions of moving, eating, digesting, etc. The former, which he designated germ plasm, in Metazoa is early differentiated from the latter, and in some forms may be distinguished as the rudiments of a germinal epithelium even before the end of segmentation. The latter develops into the vegetative organs of the adult and serves to nourish and support the former. The distinction, therefore, especially in the higher Metazoa, indicates a real difference in potential, and the vegetative cells have no primary reproductive functions. In lower Metazoa the distinction is not so clear, many of the vegetative cells turning to germ cells either in groups or singly.	In Protozoa, the division of labor between germ and somatic cells is even less pronounced, given that the entire organism, often consisting of a single cell, must perform all life functions and also handle reproduction. This blurring of lines between somatic and germ plasm in such primitive organisms raises intriguing questions about the very origins of cellular differentiation. Weismann's theory posits that in these simplest forms of life, the germ plasm is not localized in a specific region of the cell but is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. During reproduction, which is often asexual through processes like binary fission, the entire cell divides, effectively making every division a reproduction of the entire organism, including its germ plasm. This suggests that every part of the protozoan cell holds the potential to reproduce the entire organism, a phenomenon termed totipotency. However, sexual reproduction, when present in Protozoa, introduces a more complex scenario. For instance, in ciliates, a subclass of Protozoa, there are two types of nuclei: a large macronucleus responsible	1911	2000.7394

per sq. metre after exposure. Tests on a Doped Fabric. Cellulose ester are not the only substances employed as dopes. The mixture mentioned above as applied to fabric No. 81 is an example of the cheaper and hitherto more widely used compositions. When dry these are usually coated over with an oil varnish to prevent the action of water on the gelatinous layer. Some tests were made of such a fabric in different stages of proofing, and the results are appended. The laboratory numbers, weights, and descriptions, are as follows : — Laboratory Reference No. Weight in grs. per sq. m. Description. 160 161 162 1610 175-3 221-0 A rather fine linen, 100 threads to the inch. Similar linen doped. Similar, but varnished also. The stress strain diagrams for the three materials are rt produced in Figs.	6, 7, and 8 respectively. The untreated linen (Lab Ref No. 160) showed typical fabric behavior with a moderate degree of strength and elongation before rupture. Upon doping (Lab Ref No. 161), the material's weight increased due to the addition of the cellulose ester, and the stress-strain curve indicated a higher tensile strength but reduced elongation, suggesting that the doping made the fabric stiffer.  The varnished sample (Lab Ref No. 162) presented the highest increase in weight, reflecting the additional mass of the oil varnish. Interestingly, the stress-strain behavior of this sample was quite different from the others. The varnish layer provided a significant enhancement in the tensile strength, surpassing even the doped-only fabric. However, the elongation at break was the lowest among the three, indicating that the varnish layer had made the fabric significantly more brittle. These observations suggest that while both doping and varnishing increase the fabric's resistance to tensile forces, they do so at the cost of flexibility. The	1912	1999.1118
"The heat was stifling day and night. Nevertheless, the baby throve. Even at that stage, Dulayut was a happy little philosopher, and lay contentedly enjoying her mother and the temperature of 99 degrees. She was untrammelled by clothing, having successfully resisted the silver bangles which the nurse tried to force on her ankles. As the days went on she showed a determination to get to the cooler air of the window chinks. "" Me! "" commented the nurse, holding the kicking little legs, "" dekh ni wun wai ti diow!

The baby’s eyes, bright with a foreign spark, would scan every face and object with an intensity that seemed beyond her years. Her laughter was loud and her cries fierce, demanding attention whenever her interest was piqued or her displeasure aroused. It was clear even then that Dulayut would not easily blend into the backdrop of village life, with its slow rhythms and unspoken rules.

"At the Alexandrian museum the subjects of natural history and anatomy were carried on by the faculty of medicine, one of the four faculties originally established at the museum. In addition Wm. H. ""Welch, ""The Interdependence of Medicine and Other Sciences of Nature, "" Science, January 10, 1908.  to medicine agriculture also forms a root for biology as well as for chemistry. Psychology in early times had an indistinct origin in metaphysics, but as an inductive science it is of recent growth. In addition to the metaphysical problems which the study of mental processes was supposed to solve, two practical problems may be mentioned as stimulating the development of psychology. First the study and treatment of pathological mental states, which unites psychology with biology and chemistry in that all three have their origin to some extent in medicine."	Second, the application of psychological principles to education and social reform, which links psychology with sociology and pedagogy. These interdisciplinary connections highlight the evolving nature of psychology from a purely philosophical pursuit into a more empirical and applied science. The progression of psychology as a discipline was significantly influenced by the establishment of psychological laboratories, first by Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig in 1879. This event marked the transition of psychology to a more experimental and methodical approach, focusing on the observation, description, and measurement of mental phenomena. The adoption of experimental methods facilitated a more systematic and scientific exploration of human consciousness, which was previously the domain of philosophers. As psychology continued to develop, it increasingly incorporated methods and theories from other sciences. The influence of Darwinian theory, for example, introduced the concept of adaptation and evolutionary perspectives into psychological theories of human and animal behavior. This biological perspective encouraged a more integrative approach to understanding mental functions, positioning psychological phenomena within the broader context of biological survival and functioning. Furthermore, the advent of psychometrics and the development of intelligence testing brought psychology into a new realm of practical application	1911	2001.5603
"It seems that the time has nearly arrived which was so unerringly prophesied by Abraham Lincoln, when he wrote on November 21st, 1864, to his friend, William S. Elkins, as follows: ""Yes, we may all congratulate ourselves that this cruel war is nearing its close. It has cost a vast amount of treasure and blood. The best blood of the flower of American youth has been freely offered upon our country's altar that the nation might live. It has been, indeed, a trying hour for the Republic, but I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. ""As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavour to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."	"I feel more anxious for the safety of my country than ever before, even in the midst of war. God grant that my suspicions may prove groundless."" The prescient words of Lincoln echo ominously in our times as we observe the burgeoning influence of corporate power and wealth concentration. The Republic, as envisioned by its founders, was premised on the participation and benefit of the many, not the few. Yet, as we stand today, it seems the scales have tipped alarmingly towards the latter. The challenges we face are not merely economic but deeply rooted in the fabric of our political and social structures. The entrenchment of this power not only jeopardizes the economic stability of the average citizen but also threatens the pillars of democracy itself. The increasing disconnect between the governing bodies and the governed feeds into a cycle of disenfranchisement and disillusionment. It is imperative, therefore, that we heed Lincoln’s warning by fostering a more equitable distribution of wealth and ensuring that our political institutions remain free from the overbearing influence of concentrated financial power.

It is not, however, a perfect majority system. For, like the second ballot system, on which it is so obviously an improvement, and like our own double election system, on which it is a still greater improvement, it may drop out at some stage of the whole process of election a candidate who is really preferred by a clear majority to any other candidate in the field taken singly.	This inherent flaw arises because the process allows for the possibility that the most broadly acceptable candidate, who might not be the first choice of a majority initially, could be eliminated early on if they do not secure enough top-spot preferences. As the rounds of elimination proceed, voters’ secondary or tertiary choices come into play, potentially skewing the outcome away from a candidate who might have been the most acceptable overall compromise for the largest number of voters. Thus, while the system aims to ensure that the final elected candidate has the support of a majority, it does not necessarily mean that this candidate is the most favored overall when all preferences are considered. The system can be seen as a series of filters, each removing the least favored candidates based on a snapshot of preferences at each stage. However, this snapshot might not accurately reflect the deeper, more nuanced preferences of the electorate, which could be more effectively captured in a single, more comprehensive voting process that considers all preferences simultaneously. This could be achieved through methods like the Single Transferable Vote, which allows for a more nuanced expression of voter preferences and reduces the likelihood of disc	1914	2001.8506
We have seen that the two main objections which Christianity raises against Socialism, that it will abolish private property and that it will disrupt the family, whether considered as direct proposals, or as following either from any sound interpretation of Socialistic doctrine or from the adoption of the proposed economic programme, have been entirely without foundation. We have also seen that the third objection, that Socialism is materialistic, while it contains much truth, is for the most part irrelevant ; and in so far as it is significant at all, the question resolves itself into a dispute as to the best method of performing certain things which Christians and Socialists alike agree ought to be done, namely, to do away with economic injustice and to secure the largest, fullest and highest life physically, intellectually and spiritually, to all human beings.	Thus, the critique that Socialism inherently contradicts Christian values fails to recognize the deeper alignment in fundamental goals and moral imperatives. Indeed, many proponents of Socialism argue that its principles are profoundly aligned with the Christian ethos of compassion, community, and care for the disenfranchised. For instance, the redistribution of wealth in society is seen not as a threat to property rights, but as a fulfillment of the Biblical mandate to support the poor and share one's blessings. Likewise, the emphasis on community and collective action resonates with the Christian call to fellowship and communal responsibility. Moreover, the concern that Socialism advocates for a purely materialistic worldview overlooks the variety of philosophical underpinnings that can accompany socialist economic principles. While it is true that some interpretations of Socialism lean towards a secular and materialist philosophy, this is not a universal stance. Many socialist movements have been deeply intertwined with religious communities and perspectives that see the movement as part of a broader spiritual or ethical mission. In addressing the objection of materialism, it is crucial to distinguish between materialism as a philosophical worldview that	1911	2006.5348
"Next came the celebrated house of the rue St. Honore"", where, in superb rooms, the walls of which were decorated with pictures by Joseph Vernet, Boucher, Carle Vanloo, and Quantin de la Tour, Mme Geoffrin, wife of a manufacturer of mirrors, but friend of empresses and foster 1 M&noire* de Morellet, p. 205.

These gatherings were attended by the intellectual elite of Paris and beyond, including such luminaries as Diderot, d'Alembert, and Voltaire. Her salons were not merely social occasions but forums for serious philosophical and literary discussions, influencing the course of Enlightenment thought. Madame Geoffrin's influence extended well beyond the confines of her salon; she was a patron of the arts, subsidizing struggling artists and writers, ensuring that their work could reach a broader audience. Her ability to bridge the gap between the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy, coupled with her keen intellect, allowed her to cultivate a network of influential figures across Europe. Her home in rue St. Honore was more than just a meeting place. It was a crucible where ideas concerning art, politics, and philosophy were debated and refined. The walls, adorned with works by the greatest artists of the time, reflected her deep connection to the arts, while the conversations that filled these rooms echoed her commitment to intellectual exchange. The impact of these gatherings resonated far beyond these	1912	1944.7279
This process of food making is called assimilation and can be carried on only in the green parts of the plant and in these, only when exposed to light and air. Hence foliage, air and light are essential elements for plant growth, and the greater the quantity and better the development of foliage and the more light this foliage has at its disposal for its work the more vigorously will the tree grow. In general, therefore, the growth of the fruit and wood may be reduced either by the removal of foliage, which reduces the working surface, or by shading, which somewhat checks the activity of the foliage by hindering light action. Transpiration. The flow of sap in trees is not well understood.	It is known, however, that sap moves upward from the roots through the xylem or wood tissues, carrying water and dissolved minerals absorbed from the soil to the leaves. In the leaves, these substances interact with carbon dioxide absorbed from the air through tiny openings called stomata, in a process powered by sunlight known as photosynthesis. The resulting sugars and other carbohydrates are then transported throughout the plant via the phloem, another type of vascular tissue, to support growth and development in various parts of the plant including fruits, flowers, and new shoots. Transpiration plays a crucial role in this movement of sap. It is the process by which water vapor is lost from the plant through the stomata in the leaves, creating a pull that draws more water and nutrients up from the roots. This continuous stream of water moving through the plant helps to keep cells turgid and maintain structural integrity, as well as cooling the plant through evaporative cooling. However, excessive transpiration can lead to water stress, especially during periods of drought, when the roots are unable to supply enough water to replace what is	1914	2006.6267
"I happened to go round to the other window and look back and, my word ! if there wasn't the moon right behind us ! We have been travelling so very fast that we must have run past it without knowing we had done so."" "" Oh, we could not possibly have done that!"" I exclaimed. "" But there's more to come, Professor, "" continued M'Allister. ""When I last saw the moon it was nearly full and not so very much bigger than when we saw it at starting, but now this moon behind us is an enormous thing ; yet it is only a new moon, or rather what folks call a new moon with the old moon in its arms !"""	"The Professor, ever the skeptic, adjusted his glasses and peered intently through the window. ""M'Allister, what you're observing is indeed peculiar, but it's not what you think. We haven't outrun the moon, nor has its size or phase altered so drastically."" He paused, considering the phenomena before continuing. ""What you see is likely an optical illusion, a play of light and shadow caused by our unique vantage point and the velocity at which we travel. The atmosphere and other celestial bodies can distort our perception."" M'Allister, not entirely convinced but respecting the Professor's opinion, nodded slowly. ""It does seem far-fetched, doesn't it? But for a moment, it felt as if we were in a different space altogether, racing the celestial bodies in their heavenly track."" The Professor chuckled softly, his eyes twinkling with a mix of amusement and curiosity. ""The universe is vast and filled with wonders that often defy our immediate understanding. Our journey is but a brief crossing through its immense gallery of marvels. Let us keep our minds open"	1911	1960.888

I need to be doing, not just lying here thinking and worrying."" She paused, collecting her thoughts. ""And now this note from Oliver. If he's seeing that his father is lonely, then it's not just a child's fancy. Something must be done."" Charles sighed heavily, the lines of his face deepening with concern. ""I know, I know,"" he replied, his voice softening. ""Perhaps you're right. Maybe it's time we reconsidered our approach. Being away, isolated like this—it's not helping, is it? We thought a change would be beneficial, a way to escape the pressures, but perhaps we've been too hasty."" Mrs. Reading nodded, her expression resolute. ""I'll go to them tomorrow. It's clear they need us, and perhaps we need them just as much. This separation, this supposed 'cure,' it's not the answer. Not for any of us."" Charles reached out, taking her hand gently.

"As the sites for new homesteads along the fiords became exhausted, the more adventurous sought a new outlet. Passing down the west must of the Danish peninsula, they reached the Saxon plain, which stretching far inland, forced those who had been seacoast fishermen for  many ages to turn away from the sea. On islands of fertile soil rising above the floods, on banks of mud painfully won for agriculture from sea and marsh, these colonists formed their homes, as well fitted to preserve their type of family as the fiords were to produce it. They found the country almost uninhabited, and they were already in possession when Tacitus wrote.. "" They live, "" said he, "" in isolated and scattered dwellings, which they erect wherever a spring or field or wood takes their fancy."" From them came the Franks and the Saxons who carried the particularist family into Gaul and Britain. Here at once a difficulty presents itself."	How could these scattered and isolated families, each so deeply entrenched in its own peculiar customs and way of life, come together to form the effective and cohesive groups that eventually became known as the Franks and Saxons? The answer lies in the nature of their migrations and settlements. As these groups moved further inland, the necessities of defense and mutual aid compelled them to form tighter communities. While each homestead initially stood alone, the threats from neighboring tribes and the harsh realities of survival in new territories necessitated a more communal approach. Thus, over time, these isolated families began to cluster into small villages, each still maintaining its unique traditions but also sharing common interests and defenses. They built their homes close together for safety and began to share resources such as water, pastures, and arable land. The individualistic nature of their settlements gradually gave way to a more collective identity, one that was forged in the fires of necessity and mutual dependence. This transition was not immediate nor was it uniform across all areas. In some regions, the process was slower, with families clinging to their independence for generations before the	1908	1982.1975
"The differentiation of mana into magic and religion took place so early in the growth of society that MM. Hubert and Mauss do not undertake to give us instances of it; but it is, I presume, similar to the differentiation of magic and science, which in the case of medicine and alchemy was not completely effected until very late times. Finally MM. Hubert and Mauss admit that but few instances of the explicit belief in mana are known to us; but that, they say (p. 116) ""ought not to make us doubt that it has been universal."" Indeed they go so far as to say (p. 118) ""we have a right to conclude that everywhere there has existed a notion which includes that of magical power."" This conclusion is one, I should say, which yet requires proof. (5) The connexion between magic and religion, which is treated by MM. Hubert and Mauss from the point of view of Sociology, has also recently been examined by Wundt from the point of view of Psychology, in vol."	"IV of his ""Völkerpsychologie"". Wundt argues that the fundamental psychological distinction between magic and religion lies in the type of social interaction and the nature of the forces each invokes. In magic, the practitioner operates through personal power, manipulating the environment directly or invoking spirits as tools to achieve specific ends. Religion, on the other hand, involves a community of believers who interact with a divine force or beings that are worshipped and revered, not controlled. This power dynamic reflects a broader social organization where magic tends to be practiced by individuals or small groups, while religion is inherently communal and organized. Furthermore, Wundt highlights the transformation of magical practices into religious rituals as societies evolve. As the concept of supernatural power becomes institutionalized, the role of the individual magician diminishes, and the community - mediated by priesthoods or religious leaders - takes on a central role in mediating between the divine and the mundane. This transition is marked by a shift from coercive practices aimed at controlling supernatural forces to propitiatory practices aimed at appeasing or pleasing these forces. Therefore, the differentiation between"	1908	2006.3517
"Schmidt shrugged in some embarrassment, doubtful whether he was being praised or criticised. "" Some buglers can play very good music, "" he remarked, helplessly. From the gate of the straw - yard a harsh voice challenged them sharply. From the wagons they passed to the field in which the men were camped, their blankets spread on the ground between the big fires, which were now great, glowing heaps of wood ash, lighting the place with a lurid glamour and throwing red gleams on the blossom of the surrounding orchards. To Von Marx, in the mood which governed him, there was a quality in the scene that disturbed him like a presentiment."	"The very air seemed thick with the portent of events yet unfolded, each shadow cast by the flickering flames danced with ominous suggestion. He walked slowly, his boots crunching softly on the grass damp with evening dew, his eyes scanning the perimeter as if expecting some hidden danger to leap from the darkness. The men themselves appeared undisturbed, their laughter and occasional songs rising above the crackle of the fires, creating a contrast that only deepened Von Marx's sense of unease. They were soldiers, accustomed to the abrupt transitions from peace to peril, yet their current tranquility seemed to him almost a reckless disregard for the lurking uncertainties of war. As he approached one of the fires, a young soldier caught sight of him and immediately stood, saluting sharply. ""Sir,"" he said, his voice carrying clearly in the still night. Von Marx nodded, an acknowledgment rather than a return of the salute. ""Everything is quiet, sir,"" the soldier continued, perhaps misreading the concern in his superior's eyes. ""The scouts have reported no movements in the vicinity."" Von Marx merely"	1913	1972.6735
Macdonald crept up slowly. If the man woke and discovered him he would be again challenged. Should he take the man's big revolver and shoot him as he lay? No. That was a coward's action, an unjustifiable murder, he decided. He would take the horse, and risk it by making a dash for life. Therefore, on tiptoe he crept up, passing the prostrate man, till he approached the horse, and in a second, old though he was, he was nevertheless in the saddle.	With a swift, silent motion, he urged the horse forward, avoiding any sudden sounds that might awaken the sleeping man. The horse, perhaps sensing the urgency or merely trained to respond swiftly, broke into a gentle trot that quickly escalated into a gallop as they put distance between themselves and the potential threat. Macdonald's heart pounded in his chest, not just from the exertion, but from the adrenaline of the escape. He knew the risks of his choice; the landscape was treacherous in the dim moonlight, and the possibility of pursuers was real. Yet, the thrill of freedom and the wind against his face gave him a wild sense of exhilaration. He rode on, guiding the horse expertly over the rough terrain, constantly aware of the sounds of the night, listening for any indication that they had been discovered. As the miles stretched behind them, Macdonald allowed himself to think of what lay ahead. He knew the region well enough to head for a small, secluded valley where he could lay low until the search for him waned. His mind raced with plans	1906	1969.3485
The census of 1907 shows that in a total population of 2,048,980 the coloured number 608,907, or 29.7 percent. The unmixed negroes number 242,382. 17 Bryce, '' Impressions of South Africa, '' p. 366. It is an unquestionable fact that the yellow as well as the negroiu peoples possess many desirable qualities in which the whites are deficient. From this it has been argued that it would be advantageous if all races were blended into a universal type embodying the excellences of each. But scientific breeders have long ago demonstrated that the most desirable results are secured by specialising types rather than by merging them.	This principle of selective breeding, applied to human races, suggests that each race may be best served by preserving its distinctive characteristics and strengths. The argument for racial amalgamation, though appealing to some as a utopian ideal, overlooks the complexities involved in the intermingling of deeply rooted cultural, physical, and psychological traits. Furthermore, the history of civilization shows that diversity, rather than homogeneity, has fueled human progress and innovation. Each culture brings its unique perspectives and skills to the global table, enriching the collective human experience. Therefore, while promoting understanding, respect, and cooperation among different racial groups is essential, it is equally important to acknowledge and preserve the distinct identities that contribute to the vibrancy of the human race. The challenge lies not in blending all into one, but in fostering a world where all can coexist in harmony, each contributing their best to the common good.	1911	2005.6395
A fruit grower provided with a well insulated fruit room will often find it to his advantage to lower its temperature by the use of ice early in the season. Figs. 72 and 73 show a good method of constructing a fruit storage house large enough to hold a few carloads of apples, with provision for the use of ice for reducing the temperature. The building is designed to be located on a hillside of such a slope that the first floor will be on the level of the surface at one end and the second floor a few feet above the surface at the other. The building is 18 by 38 feet, interior measurement, two stories in height and divided into four rooms, two on each floor. On the second floor is the ice storage room, 18 by 21 feet, in which the future supply of ice Is stored, and the ice chamber, 15 by 16 feet, in which is held the ice that cools the refrigerating room directly below. A door in the ice chamber communicates with the outside.	The refrigerating room on the first floor, measuring 18 by 21 feet, is directly beneath the ice chamber and is cooled by the cold air descending from the ice held above. This room is used for storing the fruit and maintaining it at a constant, cool temperature. The remaining space on the first floor comprises another storage room of the same size, which can be used for additional fruit storage or for equipment and supply storage depending on the grower's needs. The construction of the building utilizes heavily insulated walls and ceilings to prevent the loss of cool air and to maintain an even temperature throughout the structure. The walls are typically built with a double layer of insulation and an air gap in between, while the roof is designed to reflect sunlight to further aid in temperature control. Proper ventilation is also crucial in the design to allow for air exchange and to prevent the buildup of ethylene gas, which can hasten the ripening and spoilage of the fruit. Adjustable vents are installed at various points to control the airflow based on external weather conditions and internal temperature requirements. The use of gravity-fed air cooling	1914	1988.1699

It is first of all a renewed link with the past and its associations; it is to be of daily uses, both public and collegiate, but these above all as preparing the future, not simply dignifying the present and commemorating the past. In sum it is a new link between Chelsea Past and Chelsea Possible. P. GEDDES. 364 THE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW ASPECTS OF THE SOCIAL MOVEMENT IN INDIA."	"The social movement in India, as it is unfolding, is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, reflecting the diverse aspirations and challenges of a rapidly transforming society. At its core, the movement seeks to address the deep-seated inequalities and entrenched social hierarchies that have long characterized Indian society, while also promoting new ideas of citizenship, empowerment, and participation. The caste system, despite being officially abolished, continues to exert a profound influence on social relations and opportunities in India. Efforts to dismantle caste barriers and promote social mobility are central to the social movement, with education and economic empowerment seen as key tools in this struggle. Additionally, affirmative action policies, such as reservations in education and employment, remain highly contentious yet critical aspects of the social reform agenda. Gender equality is another pivotal element of the social movement. Women in India face a myriad array of challenges, from pervasive violence and discrimination to limited economic opportunities and political representation.

The silver salt may be precipitated on adding silver nitrate to a fairly concentrated solution of an acetate, and can be crystallised in fine needles from hot water; the crystals contain 64-65 percent silver. It is recognised by the smell of the ethyl ester formed when ethyl alcohol is added to a solution of the acid or its salts, and the mixture treated with strong sulphuric acid. Propionic acid occurs in sweat It can be salted out of its aqueous solutions by means of calcium chloride like butyric acid. All its salts are soluble, but the silver salt the least soluble. Its basic lead salt is easily soluble in cold but not in hot water, in which respect it differs from the salts of formic, acetic and butyric acids. Normal butyric acid occurs in sweat, faeces and urine, and in the form of glycerides, to the extent of about 6 percent, in butter.	It is also a product of anaerobic fermentation, particularly during the decomposition of sugars in the presence of certain bacteria. Butyric acid can be extracted from these sources using distillation after acidification with sulphuric acid, and it is commonly synthesized through the fermentation of starches and sugars by Bacillus subtilis. This acid has a distinctly unpleasant smell, reminiscent of rancid butter, but it plays a vital role in human digestion as a by-product of microbial metabolism in the intestines. Like propionic acid, butyric acid is a short-chain fatty acid that is slightly soluble in water, but its esters are highly soluble and often pleasant-smelling, making them useful in the flavor and fragrance industries. The acid itself is used in the manufacture of varnishes and disinfectants, and as a cattle-feed supplement, it promotes healthy digestion and growth. Its salts and esters, particularly the butyrates, have applications in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, reflecting the broad utility of this fatty acid despite its initially off-putting odor.	1913	2005.5824
Detroit 65 2'9, lion Muuic. Corp’ns, § 237. note. Mil. R. Co., 20 Mich. 105 [1870].	In the landmark case, the court held that the corporation in question, being duly formed under the laws of the state, possessed the inherent powers and privileges granted to such entities, unless explicitly restricted by statute. The decision underscored the principle that a corporation, by virtue of its legal status, carries the capacity to perform all acts within the scope of its charter, and that this capacity is not to be curtailed lightly without clear legislative intent. This ruling has since served as a cornerstone in corporate law, affirming the autonomy of corporate entities to manage their own affairs, within the bounds of the law, without undue interference. The case elaborated on the rights of corporations to enter into contracts, to sue and be sued, and to own property in its name. The judgment further reinforced the doctrine of corporate personhood, establishing that a corporation is a separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders, thus shielding them from personal liability for the corporation’s debts and obligations. This principle, born out of the 1870 Michigan ruling, has had profound implications across the legal landscape, influencing countless decisions and shaping the	1913	1933.2816

Frequently revived, with notable performances by Garrick at Drury Lane, starting October 19, 1744. The play was enhanced with spectacular stage effects and costumes, making it a favorite among audiences. Garrick's portrayal of Macbeth was celebrated for its intense emotional depth and dramatic vigor, setting a standard for future productions. The Merchant of Venice. Revived by Macklin at Drury Lane on February 14, 1741. Macklin's portrayal of Shylock revolutionized the character, turning him from a comic villain into a tragic figure, imbued with dignity and pathos. This interpretation profoundly influenced subsequent renditions of the role and is considered a pivotal moment in the play's performance history. Othello.

A study of the history of the Hun and Slav, and a careful analysis of their respective national characteristics, seem to warrant the conclusion that they are both amenable to the ways of western progress, and that we have more to fear from their great numbers than we have from any undesirable qualities inherent in themselves. And now we come to consider the other type of immigrant which is making itself so strongly felt in our land and which, if we are to judge by the history of other nations, will continue to be an unsolved and vexatious problem long after the Pole and the Hun and Italian are forgotten. The Jew has been a source of worry and discomfort to every nation in which he has ever settled in any numbers, unless we except our own.	In our own case, it is true, the Jewish community has contributed significantly to various sectors, including commerce, science, and arts, enriching the cultural and economic fabric of the nation. However, the historical backdrop of their integration into society has not been without challenges. The resilience and adaptability of the Jewish people have often been met with resistance and prejudice, rooted in economic competition and cultural differences, rather than any inherent negative qualities. The influx of Jewish immigrants at different periods has sometimes stirred nativist sentiments and led to discriminatory practices, yet over time, many of these immigrants have assimilated or significantly integrated into the mainstream culture, retaining their unique heritage while contributing to the national progress. The question that remains for us, as for other nations, is not so much how to curb the influence of such a dynamic group but how to harness this potential in a way that promotes mutual understanding and the collective good. As we look towards the future, it is imperative to foster an environment of inclusivity and respect, learning from the past to address the challenges that come with a diverse population. In doing so,	1911	1999.7987
P. southeast mi mar morata. — Olive green with darker spots above; under surface of throat and limbs pale greenish yellow, generally immaculate, of belly light olive green marbled with white. P. coriacea. — yellowish brown above; sides blackish; under surfaces black and yellowish marbled. Attention has already been directed to the peculiar method of oviposition in 1'scudophryne. The Burrowing Toadlet. P. guentheri. Two large oval compressed metatarsal tubercles on each foot; tip of the toe not reaching beyond the eye. A large parotoid gland on each side of the head. Hind limb very stout, the longest toe not reaching  beyond the eye. Upper surfaces with prominent smooth warts more or less confluent into lines. Male with large flat oval lumbar gland. Colour: Brown or olive above; forehead and a few large markings on the back lighter.	Underparts whitish, often with gray or brown mottling especially on the throat and chest areas. This species is typically found in sandy or loose soil environments where it can utilize its specialized burrowing adaptations. P. guentheri is known for its unique burrowing behavior, using its robust hind limbs and metatarsal tubercles to dig into the ground. This provides a means of escaping predators and extreme weather conditions, particularly during the dry season. Additionally, P. guentheri exhibits a fascinating reproductive strategy. Unlike many amphibians that lay eggs in water, this species deposits its eggs in underground burrows, which helps protect them from desiccation and potential aquatic predators. The eggs undergo direct development, meaning they hatch as fully formed miniatures of the adults, bypassing the free-swimming tadpole stage typical of many other frog species. This combination of physical and behavioral adaptations makes P. guentheri a particularly interesting subject of study in terms of evolutionary biology and ecology. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions not only showcases the diverse strategies employed by amphibians	1909	2007.5629
So far as we can connect them with the actual experience of men, this will help us to appreciate their reality and power. The effort to do this will make plain to us some other things which it is important to remember. [ 74]  We shall see at once that the book does not come from a single writer, but from many authors and ages. It represents the heart of man in communion with God through a thousand years of history, from Moses to Nehemiah, perhaps even to the time of the Maccabaean revival. It is, therefore, something very much larger and better than an individual book. It is the golden treasury of lyrics gathered from the life of the Hebrew people. And this gives to it a singular and precious quality of brotherhood. The fault, or at least the danger, of modern lyrical poetry is that it is too solitary and separate in its tone.	It tends to express the isolated emotions of individual poets, often disconnected from the broader human experience. In contrast, the poetry found within this ancient text is deeply communal, reflecting the collective joys, sorrows, fears, and triumphs of a people. Each line resonates with the shared spirit of a community, making it timeless and universally relatable. Moreover, the variety of voices within this compendium ensures a richness and diversity of perspective that is rarely found in the works of a single author. It allows for a more nuanced exploration of themes such as faith, justice, suffering, and redemption, themes that are central to the human condition. As we delve into these ancient writings, we encounter a mosaic of human emotion and divine interaction, painted across centuries by various hands, each adding their unique hue to the spiritual and cultural heritage of their time. This multifaceted nature not only enhances its literary value but also its spiritual depth. For the modern reader, it offers a chance to engage with a living tradition, one that has not only survived but thrived through millennia, adapting and resonating with	1908	2006.8646

Courtney Saville would succeed Francis Brill.	He had always liked the sound of Courtney—more distinguished, he thought, and certainly less common than Francis. Saville added just the right touch of sophistication and mystery. Yes, Courtney Saville, he decided, would be a man of enigma, a character right out of the pages of a thrilling novel, the type that could command attention in any drawing room or court of law. As the ship rocked gently now that the storm had passed, Courtney—no longer Francis—looked out over the dark waters, the pain in his nose a dull throb that seemed almost inconsequential compared to the excitement of his transformation. He imagined the grand introductions at social gatherings, the whispered speculations about his origins, and the respect he would command in professional circles. This incident, though unfortunate, had given him a rare opportunity: to reinvent himself in the image of his aspirations. He began to plan. First, he would need a new wardrobe to match his new identity—something less provincial, more in line with the fashions of London's elite. Then, there were the manner	1913	1973.6105
"Then neither side gave quarter, and now today all through Islington, Hoxton, Kingsland, and Dalston, right out eastward to Homerton, a perfect massacre of Germans is in progress. ""Lord Byfield has issued two urgent proclamations, threatening the people of London with all sorts of penalties if they kill instead of taking an enemy prisoner, but they seem to have no effect. London is starved and angered to such a pitch that her hatred knows no bounds, and only blood will atone for the wholesale slaughter of the innocent since the bombardment of the metropolis began. ""The Kaiser has, we hear, left the 'Belvedere' at Scarborough, where he has been living incognito. A confidential report, apparently well founded, has reached us that he embarked upon the steam trawler Morning Star at Scarborough yesterday, and set out across the Dogger, with Germany, of course, as his destination. Surely he must now regret his ill advised policy of making an attack upon England."	The streets of London, once bustling with the usual daily throng of busy city life, have transformed into scenes of fury and vengeance. The mobs, driven by hunger and rage, are unrelenting in their pursuit of justice—or what they perceive as such. Amidst the chaos, the sound of breaking glass and the shouts of the enraged populace echo through the air, a grim reminder of the city's descent into lawlessness. Reports continue to flood in from various quarters, detailing the brutal reprisals against anyone suspected of being German. The police, overwhelmed and undermanned, are barely able to maintain any semblance of order; their attempts to control the crowd are futile against the wave of collective fury. In quieter moments, one can almost hear the city's heartbeat, racing with a mix of fear and a desperate craving for retribution. The once revered principles of law and justice seem to have evaporated, replaced by a visceral need to respond to the horrors that have been inflicted upon the city. As the news of the Kaiser's departure spreads, mixed reactions swirl through the city. Some	1906	1974.9203
But even in temperate South Africa it is possible that large political units, wholly black, may survive. The South African black, except in Cape Colony, is not at present granted equal political rights, but if he continues to progress in intelligence as he has recently done his demand for political and social equality must become exceedingly strong, as it has in the United States; and the struggle for equality will of itself be a means of developing a fixed sense of race separateness which must long make the colour question a sore spot in South African politics. In the Australian commonwealth the colour problem exhibits a most peculiar and interesting phase. The aboriginal inhabitants scarcely figure in the question at all.	Their numbers are too sparse, and their assimilation into the modern societal fabric almost negligible, rendering them largely invisible in political debates on race and integration. Instead, the Australian color question predominantly revolves around policies concerning immigrants, particularly from Asia. The introduction of the White Australia Policy at the beginning of the 20th century was a clear reflection of the prevalent attitudes towards maintaining a homogeneous white British-descended population. As Australia progresses through the century, however, there has been a gradual but noticeable shift in these perceptions. The dismantling of the White Australia Policy through various legislative changes during the mid to late 20th century marked a significant transformation in the country’s approach to racial diversity. This policy change, driven by both economic necessities and a growing recognition of human rights, allowed for a more multicultural society where Asian and other non-European immigrants could contribute more substantially both economically and culturally. This shift, while progressive, has not resolved all racial tensions. Debates about immigration, cultural integration, and the role of race in societal identity continue to be prominent. Similar to South Africa, Australia faces challenges in reconciling	1911	2006.3712
"So you've come round at last ?"" said the doctor. ""GoodI Don'T try to talk Vol. CXXVII. — No. 759. — 45 just yet, though. You'Ll feel more up to it presently."" His plump, deft fingers were feeling Von Marx's brow under the bandage that circled it and trying his pulse. The injured man moved his dry lips. ""Where — ?"" he managed to breathe. ""Hush!"""	"the doctor gently admonished, pressing a finger to his own lips. ""You're in the hospital. You've had a bit of a bad turn, but you're safe now. Don't worry about anything. Just focus on resting."" Von Marx's eyes flickered with a mix of confusion and relief as he tried to assimilate his surroundings. The sterile smell of antiseptics, the soft hum of medical equipment, and the occasional distant clatter of a trolley rolling down the hallway—all these details slowly pieced together the reality of his situation. The doctor, noticing his patient's growing awareness, offered a reassuring smile. ""You've been unconscious for a while,"" he continued. ""There was an accident, but you're on the mend now. We'll take good care of you here."" Von Marx's mind raced as he processed this information, his memory foggy. The last thing he remembered was the urgent rush of wind and a blinding light, then nothing until now. His throat felt parched, and he whispered, ""Water... please."" Without a word"	1913	1999.9447
Not only his character, reputation, and truthfulness may be inquired into and tested, but he is subject to an examination as to his professional qualifications, his knowledge, accuracy, and learning. For the annoyance and risks of injury to a man’s business consequent to undergoing such an examination and for the information thus established, the courts must declare no compensation‘ is due or they cannot support their decisions. 300. If Expert Cannot Collect Extra Compensation, then No Extra Preparation Can be Required: However doubtful the law may be as to extra compensation to experts for professional opinions, it is certain that if an expert can demand no more pay than an ordinary witness, so certain is it.	that he cannot be required to make any special preparation for giving evidence beyond that which any ordinary witness would be expected to make. This principle holds even if the preparation involves considerable labor and the application of special skills or knowledge which the expert uniquely possesses. The courts have consistently held that the duty of an expert witness is to testify to facts observed and opinions formed in the ordinary course of his professional work, not to undertake new investigations or to prepare elaborate studies specifically for the case. 301. The Role of the Expert Witness in Court: The primary role of an expert witness in court is to provide clarity and understanding to the court regarding complex technical or professional matters. An expert witness does this by explaining the facts or data that are beyond the common knowledge of the judges or jury. This assistance must be strictly confined to the expert’s area of specialty and must be based on information that is already known to the expert through his professional activities. The expert should not assume the role of an advocate or become a partisan in the proceedings, but should remain a neutral and objective provider of facts and informed opinion.	1913	1959.6779
Mr. Turtle said he didn't think his ancestor flew much, and that they had never been able to find all the pieces of him to this day. He said he thought it was better to start from the ground and go up. So they went along, talking, to Mr. Rabbit's house, and it was about sundown when they got there, for it was several mile posts, and Mr. Turtle doesn't travel very fast. 642 Mr. Rabbit said it would bo fine to have supper, with some of his new juice to go with it; so he Hew around and got out his best things, and made a nice soup out of vegetables from his garden (for Mr. Rabbit has the best garden of anybody), and when it was all ready he went out where Mr. Turtle was sitting on the front stoop, looking at the moon and a new comet (which some people said was going to strike the Big Deep Woods), and told him to come in.	Mr. Turtle ambled slowly into the cozy dining room, his eyes twinkling at the sight of the spread Mr. Rabbit had prepared. The table was laden with an assortment of dishes, all fragrant and steaming under the warm glow of the candlelight. As Mr. Rabbit served the vegetable soup, he chattered excitedly about the day's happenings in the Big Deep Woods, occasionally pausing to ensure Mr. Turtle had everything he needed. After the soup, Mr. Rabbit brought out a platter of roasted root vegetables and a fresh green salad tossed with nuts and berries, a favorite of Mr. Turtle. The conversation meandered from the weather, which was turning crisp as the season changed, to tales of their younger days and the adventures they had experienced. As they ate, Mr. Turtle listened intently, nodding and chuckling, his slow, thoughtful responses providing a grounding contrast to Mr. Rabbit’s rapid-fire enthusiasm. The new juice Mr. Rabbit had mentioned turned out to be a delightful berry concoction, sweet and tart, which perfectly complemented the meal	1913	1985.8293
"Instantly the music ceased, and there was a pause of dead silence. Huntford stood patiently in the lamplit dusk, and presently he heard Herr Vollmer moving softly within. Then the door was opened very slowly to the width of an inch or so, and one eye and a section of Herr Vollmer's face appeared at the narrow crack. "" I hope I don't intrude, "" said Hunt ford, "" but it seemed to me that such near neighbours as we are ought to be better acquainted with each other. The fact is, "" he added, "" I am ashamed of myself that I have not called upon you before."" "" Ach, ja!"" said Herr Vollmer. "" Dot is so! Come in! Come in!"" He stood aside and Huntford entered. Herr Voll mer motioned him to a sofa or lounge beneath the studio window, and as Hunt ford sat himself down upon the soft — the luxuriously soft — seat, he was impressed (although he could see but indistinctly in the rapidly gathering darkness) with the elegance, it may even be said with the sumptuousness, of Herr Voll mer's surroundings."	"The walls were adorned with rich tapestries and a collection of fine paintings, each illuminated by its own subtle lighting, creating an ambiance of cultured sophistication. The furnishings were a blend of classical and modern, with heavy, ornate pieces juxtaposed against sleek, minimalist designs. A grand piano sat in one corner, its ebony surface gleaming under the soft glow of a nearby lamp. Herr Vollmer, noticing Huntford's appreciative gaze, seemed to swell with a quiet pride. ""I find comfort in surrounding myself with beautiful things,"" he said, his voice carrying a hint of an accent that hinted at his European origins. ""They are reminders of the beauty that exists in the world, despite the shadows that life sometimes casts."" He moved to a sideboard and poured two glasses of a dark, amber liquid. ""Brandy?"" he offered, extending a glass towards Huntford. As the latter accepted it, Herr Vollmer continued, ""I believe that good music and good drink can elevate our spirits and bring us closer to the sublime."" Huntford sipped the brandy,"	1913	1999.1198
"I hate a wife to whom I go to school."" There were notable exceptions to this rule of ignorance among Roman women — for instance, the women of the Scipio family win our admiration for their attainments. Of these we shall have more to say hereafter; but they do not disprove, rather, by the startling contrast they provide, do they prove the state of intellectual darkness of the majority of their fellow women. AMY HAUGHTON. (To be continued.)"	Indeed, it is the remarkable lives of such exceptional women that illuminate the otherwise dim historical landscape of women's intellectual and social roles in ancient Rome. Women like Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, who not only managed her household with famed diligence but also educated her sons to become significant political figures, exemplify this influence. Her correspondence and shrewd political advice were highly regarded, suggesting a level of education and acumen not commonly afforded to most Roman women of the time. The rarity of such educated women only highlights the broader societal restrictions placed on women's learning and participation in public life. Most were confined to domestic roles, their education limited to household management and perhaps some basic literacy, if that. The intellectual pursuits and public roles were predominantly reserved for men, with women's involvement seen as an exception rather than a norm. As we explore further into the lives of these exceptional women in subsequent discussions, it becomes clear that their stories are not just mere footnotes in history but pivotal chapters that challenge our understanding of gender roles in ancient civilizations. Their legacy is a testament to the potential that was	1911	1979.6647
"But he confines himself in the ancient world to Greeks and Romans, and in the ancient, mediaeval and modern worlds to Teutons, leaving wider inquiries to others, and contented to be sure of his footing on his own ground. He deals with the State itself, the head of the State, the King, and its body, the Assembly; and finds in Hellenic, Italian and Teutonic antiquity alike, the germs alike of the monarchic, the aristocratic, and the democratic principles of government. Everywhere he puts the tribe before civic or national institutions; he contrasts the Hellenic and Italian  conception of the State as a city with the modern conception of a national State and asserts broadly that "" the Teutons passed from the tribal stage into the national stage without ever going through the city stage at all."" He traces the idea of kingship from the Homeric king, zeus born and Zeus nourished, down to the constitutional monarchies of modern times."	He observes the transformation from the almost divine reverence afforded to the early kings, whose authority was deemed to stem directly from celestial endorsement, to the contemporary monarch, bound by constitutions and often symbolizing the state more than ruling it. This progression, he notes, mirrors the broader societal shift from viewing the state as an extension of the divine order to seeing it as the product of human agreement and legislation.  Moreover, he explores the assembly's evolution from a gathering of elite elders or warriors in ancient societies to more inclusive democratic institutions, where policies and leaders are determined by a broader segment of the population. This change, according to his analysis, reflects a gradual democratization of power, paralleling the shift from a strictly hierarchical society to one where there is greater equality among citizens. In his meticulous examination, he delves into how these ancient forms have influenced modern governmental structures, suggesting that many contemporary political concepts have their roots in these early models. He argues that understanding these origins is crucial for comprehending the present complexities of state governance and the ongoing struggle between different political ideologies and systems. Through his focused study	1908	1995.168
"In more enlightened America the High School teacher is sent away for a year's holiday every seven years, and her salary is paid, but in America there is a value set on the personality of the teacher. In England little value is set on the teacher in any way. What is she but a teacher, or, more contemptuously, "" a school teacher "" ? She educates the race, and receives in return thirty-six shillings a week. VARIOUS HANDS."	"In contrast, the plight of the English teacher, burdened not only by the weight of her responsibilities but also by the scant recognition of her role, is indeed a stark one. The notion that one who imparts knowledge and molds future generations should be so meagerly compensated and appreciated is a reflection of the broader societal undervaluation of education. It is not merely a question of financial remuneration; it is the lack of societal respect and support that truly belies the grave discrepancy in how educators are regarded across the Atlantic. Moreover, the absence of provisions for rest and rejuvenation for teachers in England starkly contrasts with the American system, where the importance of maintaining the well-being of educators is acknowledged and actively supported. This disparity not only affects the morale of the teachers but inevitably impacts the quality of education that the students receive. For how can one expect a teacher, worn by continuous toil and devoid of adequate rest or encouragement, to perform at their best? It is high time that England reevaluates its stance on the value of teachers. They are not merely ""school teachers"";"	1911	1989.4889
Larger prices in shorter time appeal strongly to the farmer, and he is quite willing to send two out of every litter to the special feeding station of his society in order to find out beyond a doubt not only what is good for pigs, but particularly for his pigs. If skimmed milk means sides and sausage, another fact the bacon co operators have discovered is that pig's blood means tulips. One industry inherits from another. The admirable bacon factory at Frederikssund shows that every particle of pig's blood drained from the concrete floors upon coke, dried in an oven, pulverised, and shipped in tight cartons to Holland to fertilise her beds of world famous tulips, is sold at a price that adds materially to the profits paid back to the members of the bacon society. The advantages of co operative pig curing are manifold. In the first place, the farmer is relieved of every responsibility but growing his animal and delivering it to the factory.	From there, the society takes over, managing the slaughter, processing, and distribution, thus ensuring that each step is handled efficiently and hygienically. This streamlined process not only maximizes the quality of the final product but also significantly reduces waste. Every part of the pig is utilized, from the meat to the by-products like blood and bones, which are transformed into valuable commodities. Moreover, the centralized handling by the cooperative allows for better bargaining power when selling the products. By pooling their resources and outputs, farmers can access larger markets that would be out of reach individually. This collective approach often leads to better pricing, both in buying feed and selling the bacon, which in turn increases the profitability for each member. Additionally, the cooperative model fosters a spirit of community and mutual assistance among farmers. They share knowledge and techniques, learn from each other’s successes and failures, and collectively invest in innovations that can improve their operations and products. This community support system is crucial, especially in challenging economic times or when dealing with diseases that could affect livestock. Finally, the environmental impact is also considered. The cooperative	1913	2005.8479
There are thus three important factors to be taken into account in solving public utility problems. We have first the possibility of municipal, state or national close control of rates and charges; then the possibility of lower rates and charges if taxes and payments by private corporations engaged in public service are abolished; and then the possibility of making still lower rates by drawing upon land values at least for the original cost of establishing the service. Some of this runs counter to the expressed views of many well informed and undoubtedly public-spirited citizens.	Yet, it cannot be ignored that the financial structure of public utilities bears directly upon their efficiency and accessibility to the masses. The debate over municipal versus private control is not merely ideological but deeply intertwined with practical outcomes on service quality and economic equity. The argument for municipal control often hinges on the premise that public ownership eliminates the profit motive, potentially leading to lower costs and more equitable service distribution. Conversely, proponents of private management argue that competition and profit incentives drive innovation and efficiency, albeit sometimes at the cost of higher rates. Furthermore, the integration of land value taxation as a means to fund public utilities presents an intriguing alternative. By leveraging the increased property values that typically accompany the establishment of utilities, municipalities can potentially fund these services without imposing traditional tax structures that may burden less affluent citizens disproportionately. This approach also aligns with the principles of economic equity, as it essentially charges those who benefit most from public investments. In conclusion, while these proposals may diverge from traditional views, they offer a comprehensive framework for addressing the perennial challenges of managing public utilities. Each option presents distinct advantages and potential pitfalls, necessitating a	1911	2006.686

On the back is written, "" Character of Preville, the French comedian ; June 12th, 1756, "" (a dip for 1765). Garrick composed it, then, just at the moment when northeast was annoyed at PreVille's seeming want of courtesy ; that is probably the reason why he did not communicate it to Suard. Mr. Baker, in his Unpublished Correspondence, p. 27, quotes it as written at Paris; but 1 v June 5th, 1765, Garrick had been back at London for more than a month. Another French actor who had much admiration for Garrick was Caillpt."	Caillot often spoke of Garrick's performances with great enthusiasm, recounting the subtleties of his expressions and the profound impact of his dramatic interpretations. He admired how Garrick could transform himself completely into his characters, bringing them to life with a realism that was rarely seen on the French stage at the time. Caillot's own approach to acting was deeply influenced by these observations, and he endeavored to incorporate similar elements of emotional depth and authenticity into his performances. Despite the admiration, there was also a sense of rivalry, as each actor sought to prove the superiority of their respective national styles of acting. French theatre at the time was marked by a more formal and declamatory style, whereas Garrick introduced a more naturalistic style that was revolutionary in its focus on psychological realism. This transnational exchange of ideas between actors like Garrick and Caillot was indicative of a broader trend in the 18th century, where the arts served as a conduit for cultural dialogue between England and France. This period saw increased interest in and appreciation for the nuances of different national artistic expressions,	1912	1975.4967

Olive shrugged, her expression softening a bit as she looked at her younger brother. ""I don't know, Tam. But we need to be strong, all of us. We have to take care of each other now."" Charlie nodded, feeling a weight settle on his shoulders—a sense of responsibility he hadn't felt before. He reached out and squeezed Tam's shoulder reassuringly.

What a bustle of preparation there was on the night before; the mending of lapti, the filling of the sacks with things to be dipped in the stream, the procuring of bottles and cans for bringing back the water of the river. For most of us it was an extraordinary occasion, a pilgrimage within a pilgrimage; for those who were in Palestine for the first time it was a first occasion of tramping a distance in such a crowd. The caravan, of course, is not travelling, like gipsies, in houses on wheels, but the journeying together of a great concourse of people on foot, or, in the East, with camels and mules. There were more than a thousand of us that set out next morning at dawn, even before it was light. Lubomudrof was there, dear old Dyadya, the boy from the Urals.	He had never seen such a multitude gathered in one place before, and his eyes were wide with wonder. The older pilgrims, seasoned by many such journeys, moved with a purposeful stride, their faces set toward the sacred river with an air of solemn determination. Younger participants, like Lubomudrof, were swept up in the excitement, their laughter and chatter piercing the cool morning air. As the sky began to lighten, the throng pressed forward, each step bringing them closer to their spiritual destination. The path was rough, winding through rocky terrain and sparse vegetation, but the collective spirit of the group made the journey seem lighter. Occasionally, they would pass through small villages where curious locals would come out to watch the procession, offering blessings and sometimes, fresh water and bread. The leaders of the caravan, wise with experience, paced the journey to allow for rest at intervals. During these breaks, stories were exchanged—tales of past pilgrimages, of miracles witnessed, and of the deep personal reasons each had for undertaking this arduous trek. The unity of purpose bound them	1913	1955.8771

"M. Chevreul's yellow light must have been something different to that of our lamps to have produced the effects lie describes. The series of black, white, and intermediate shades which Mr. Ritchie gives to represent the "" tone values '' of various colours produced by different  83 lights can do no more than indicate their comparative luminosity. Would it not have made the matter clearer to have called them luminosity values, for although the word "" tone '' is correctly used to signify the brightness of a colour, it is so often confounded with ideas of hue, shade, tint, or the purity or dullness of a colour that its meaning may be a little ambiguous."	"Indeed, the complexity of the term ""tone"" could easily lead to misunderstandings, especially among those who are not deeply versed in the nuances of color theory. Luminosity, on the other hand, directly addresses the aspect of light and brightness, which is central to the effects that M. Chevreul was exploring. By focusing on luminosity values, one can more accurately assess and compare the impact that different lighting conditions have on the perception of various colors. This clarity is essential when considering the practical applications of Chevreul’s findings, such as in painting, textile design, or interior decorating, where the true representation of color under varied lighting conditions can significantly influence the aesthetic outcome. Furthermore, understanding luminosity helps in the creation of visual effects in photography and cinematography, where lighting plays a pivotal role in setting mood and directing viewer attention. Thus, while ""tone"" might capture a broader range of color characteristics, specifying ""luminosity values"" could provide a more precise and useful framework for discussing and applying the principles outlined by Chevreul and further elaborated by Mr. Ritch"	1912	2006.9188

Method of Testing.—The floats were mounted on the carrier with a precision that ensured their stability during the experiments. Water was poured into the testing tank to a predetermined level, mimicking the conditions the floats would encounter in a real-world scenario. The carrier, equipped with the floats, was then drawn through the water at varying speeds to simulate different flying conditions. Sensors attached to the carrier and the floats measured the resistance encountered, the buoyancy levels, and the angle of attack of each float during motion. 8. Data Collection and Analysis.—Throughout the series of tests, data was continuously collected from the sensors and recorded for later analysis. This data included the drag coefficient, lift forces, and the overall hydrodynamic efficiency of the floats. Special attention was paid to the behavior of the floats at the moment of take-off and landing simulations, as these are critical phases for hydroplane performance. 9. Adjustments and Re-testing.—Based on initial findings, adjustments were made to the positioning of the floats on the carrier to optimize performance. This involved altering the gap between the floats, as well as their	1912	1981.0597

He wrote to him simply as a friend, and in his letters are to be seen true sympathy and sincere respect for Garrick's character and talents ; these feelings the English actor fully reciprocated.	"Garrick often expressed his appreciation for the warmth and candor in the letters he received, remarking on more than one occasion how they bolstered his spirits during times of harsh criticism and professional doubt. The correspondence between the two men spanned several years, revealing a mutual admiration and a shared understanding of the pressures and joys of theatrical life.  In one particularly heartfelt letter, Garrick wrote of the solace he found in Liolard's words, stating, ""Your letters, dear friend, arrive as balm to the weary soul, soothing the sting of public censure and reminding me of the true essence of our art."" Liolard, in turn, praised Garrick's latest performances, which he had read about in reviews, and offered his own reflections on the evolving nature of drama and audience expectations. Their exchange not only provided personal support but also fostered a creative dialogue that influenced their respective works. Liolard occasionally shared drafts of his new plays, seeking Garrick's insights on plot and character development, while Garrick confided in Liolard about the challenges of"	1912	1941.4598
624 The next step in the evolution was to cut off the supply of silver money by closing the mints to silver coinage. Under cover of a bill which provided for revising and amending the laws relative to the mints, the coinage of silver was covertly dropped. By the same surreptitious method, under an act to codify the statutes, the legal tender quality of silver dollars for any sum in excess of five dollars was taken away. This brought on the silver struggle. Popular agitation for the re opening of the mints and the re coinage of silver resulted in the partial restoration of silver coinage under the Bland allison bill of 1878, which was superseded in 1890 by the law known as the Sherman bill, whereby silver bullion to the amount of four and one half million ounces per month was purchased by the government, against which were issued silver treasury notes. These notes constitute a large part of the currency used in business today. Under President Harrison and Cleveland the money trust succeeded in having the Secretary of the Treasury surrender the option of the government to redeem its notes in silver and in having them redeemed in gold.	"This action effectively placed the United States on a de facto gold standard, further marginalizing silver. This shift was met with considerable resistance from those who supported bimetallism, the system under which both gold and silver were used as legal tender. Proponents of silver argued that the gold standard benefited the wealthy and creditors by keeping money scarce and interest rates high, while harming farmers and debtors who benefited from the inflationary effects of a more plentiful money supply that included silver. The debate reached a fever pitch during the presidential election of 1896, where William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic candidate, famously proclaimed in his ""Cross of Gold"" speech that mankind should not be crucified on a cross of gold, advocating strongly for the free coinage of silver. Despite Bryan's impassioned arguments, he lost the election to William McKinley, who was a staunch supporter of the gold standard. The victory of McKinley signaled the waning influence of the silver movement, and in 1900, the Gold Standard Act was passed, which confirmed the gold standard and effectively ended the use of silver as standard"	1911	1988.4425
Kimberley was a failure; men languished on the scorched, bewildering trail, died of fever and disillusionment on the fields, perished of hunger and thirst and uttermost exhaustion on the dispirited way back. But presently there were mild discoveries to the south — taunting promises of the greater thing; and some ten years later Bagley stumbled on the riches of a fairy tale in a dry desolation called by the aborigi nals Coolgardie. Coolgardie was overrun by a wild motley from the several Australian colonies and the far four quarters of the earth. Within the year Pat Hannan scratched the earth at Kalgoorlie and disclosed in one delirious day square miles of wealth in alluvial gold. Dreams came true — the maddest visions of the leanest old graybeard who had prospected that parched and fiery waste through years of dogged expectation. Came, then, the rush to Siberia — to Bulong and White Feather and Black Flag and Broad Arrow.	Towns sprang up as if by magic, shanties and tents clustered thickly where once had been but the red dust and the lonely spinifex. The air, once silent save for the whistle of the wind, now rang with the clamor of picks, the rattle of cradles, the creaking of wheelbarrows, and the shouts of men. Saloons, stores, and makeshift gambling dens grew as naturally as weeds in a garden, each new establishment as temporary and fragile as the hopes that built them. Men poured into the region, their eyes alight with greed and desperation, each one driven by the tales of nuggets just lying on the ground, waiting to be picked up by the lucky or the swift. Fortunes were made and lost in the blink of an eye, and every fresh face was a story of either a dream pursued or a life running from something worse. The desert, indifferent to human suffering or success, watched as its face was scarred by the relentless digging, the upheaval of its ancient soils, and the ceaseless tr	1913	1928.706
It is true that moral progress has a tendency to increase our sense of duty towards our fellowmen. But at the same time it also makes us more considerate as regards the motives of conduct; and — not to speak of suicides committed for the benefit of others — the despair of the self murderer will largely serve as a palliation of the wrong which he may possibly inflict upon his neighbour. EDWARD WESTERMARCK. 34 THE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW THE CRIMINAL PROBLEM.	The question of crime and its causes has long vexed society, and numerous theories have been proposed to explain this dark aspect of human behavior. Some argue that criminality is born of economic desperation, others that it is a manifestation of psychological imbalance, and still others that it is merely a product of societal conditions that shape an individual’s choices.  In our quest to address the criminal problem, we must consider a holistic approach that encompasses social, economic, and psychological factors. The rehabilitation of offenders, rather than mere punishment, should be the cornerstone of our criminal justice system. This approach not only aims at reducing recidivism but also at transforming offenders into productive members of society. Moreover, preventive measures should be emphasized, focusing on education and community programs that can deter individuals from turning to crime. By investing in social services and ensuring economic opportunities, we can address some of the root causes of criminal behavior. Thus, the criminal problem requires not just a response from the justice system but a concerted effort from all sectors of society. Only through a comprehensive and compassionate approach can we hope to make significant strides in solving	1908	2006.1779
"1 His Letters sur lei arts imitateurs ; ou rur la danse et sur let ballets had several editions: Lyons, 1760 (8vo); Stuttgart, 1760 (12mo); London, 1783 (8vo); St. Petersburg, 1803 (4to); La Haye, 1807 (8vo). 5 That of Lyons (where Noverre directed the ballets from 1757 to 1760), which at this date was the finest in France. adopted is superior to that I have given up, I must admit that of all my ballets that one made the least sensation here Farther on, speaking of the necessity of suppressing the masks usually worn by ballet dancers and of trusting to the natural expression of the features, * Noverre says: "" Mr. Garrick, the celebrated English actor, is the model I propose."	"His remarkable ability to convey the deepest emotions without the use of masks is what I believe dancers should emulate. The mask hides the face, which is the mirror of the soul, and thus, conceals the genuine expressions that are crucial to the performance. The art of ballet, as in acting, should strive to represent human emotions as faithfully and intensely as possible. This can only be achieved through the unmasked, natural expressions of the dancers, allowing them to connect more profoundly with the audience."" Noverre goes on to criticize the then-prevailing tendencies in ballet that favored elaborate costumes and intricate machinery over the purity of expressive dance. He argues that these external embellishments detract from the emotional and thematic core of the ballet. ""The true artistry of ballet lies not in superficial spectacle but in its ability to portray the subtleties of human experience, to tell a story through the body's movement, guided by the music and expressed on the dancer's face."" This revolutionary idea proposed by Noverre in his letters was instrumental in shaping modern ballet, steering it towards more expressive and narrative-driven performances"	1912	1977.0126
"I don't believe for one moment that she will marry a penniless A. She has endless opportunities, and, I am told, many proposals — "" Ah! — "" The journal at this point was abruptly closed and locked away. For the writer of it, who was sitting nt an open window of the library, became aware of the entrance of a motor into the forecourt of the house. Arthur Coryston was sitting in it. When he perceived Lester at the window, he waved to the librarian, and, jumping from the car as it drew up at the front door, he came across the court to a side door, which gave access to the library staircase. As he entered the room, Lester was disagreeably struck by his aspect. It was that of a man who has slept ill and drunk unwisely. His dress was careless, his eyes haggard, and all the weaknesses of the face seemed to have leapt to view amid the general relaxation of tenue and dignity."	"""Good morning, Lester,"" Arthur managed, his voice uneven, betraying a night of turmoil. ""I hope I'm not intruding too early."" Lester, adjusting his spectacles, scrutinized Arthur with a mixture of concern and disapproval. ""Not at all, Arthur. But you seem... distressed. Was there a problem on the road?"" Arthur shook his head, pacing near the shelves lined with leather-bound books. ""No, the drive was fine. It's everything else that's amiss."" He stopped and turned toward Lester, his expression fraught with anxiety. ""I need your advice, or perhaps your listening ear, more than anything."" Lester gestured towards a pair of armchairs by the fireplace. ""Sit down, Arthur. Tell me what's troubling you."" As they settled into the chairs, Arthur ran his fingers through his disheveled hair, sighing deeply. ""It's Helena,"" he began, the name coming out like a sigh. ""I proposed to her last night."" Lester raised his eyebrows, a silent prompt for more information. "	1913	1985.5885
As Marcia moved away, there was a sudden sound at the end of the hall. Arthur had run hurriedly toward the door leading to the outer vestibule. He opened it and disappeared. Through the high arched windows to the left, a boy on a bicycle could be seen descending the long central avenue leading to the fore court. It was just noon. The great clock set in the centre of the eastern facade had chimed the hour, and as its strokes died away on the midsummer air Marcia was conscious, as her mother had been the preceding afternoon, of an abnormal stillness round her. She was in her sitting room, trying to write a letter to Mrs. Bets's sister about the boy mentioned in his mother's last words.	The pen seemed heavy in her hand as she attempted to articulate her thoughts. Each word felt labored, a testament to the emotional weight the situation carried. The room around her, usually filled with the soft patter of servants and the distant laughter of the estate's guests, was unnervingly silent. She found herself pausing, listening intently for any sound that might break the stillness—a creak of the floorboards, the rustle of the ivy against the pane—but nothing came. It was as though the entire house was holding its breath. Outside, the sun was high, casting sharp shadows across the manicured lawns and turning the fountain's spray into a mist of diamonds. It was a perfect day, yet the beauty seemed almost mocking in its contrast to her somber task. She dipped her pen into the inkwell again, her thoughts drifting to Arthur's sudden departure. What urgency had called him so precipitously? The unknowns tangled with her concern for the boy, whose future now lay uncertain. Drawing a deep breath, Marcia forced her attention back to the	1913	1960.5858
"If for no other reason on earth, we ought to have it for those two reasons. ""These are two of the steps toward direct legislation, and now I come to another phase of popular government which is not so generally favoured as the initiative and the referendum — namely, the provision known as the recall. ""This so-called dangerous and unwise novelty in legislation is simply the same provision made by every man who hires labourers, the retention of the power of discharge. Is there anything novel or strange about that?"	Certainly not. It is the fundamental right of every employer to dismiss an employee if the work performed fails to meet the agreed standards or if the employee behaves in a manner detrimental to the interests of the employer. In the context of public service, why should the citizens, who are essentially the employers of public officials, not retain a similar right? The recall allows for this—it is a mechanism through which the voters can remove an elected official from office before the end of his or her term if they believe that the official is not fulfilling their duties effectively or ethically. This provision does not destabilize the political system, as some fear, but rather reinforces the accountability of public officials. By knowing they can be recalled, officials may be more motivated to serve with integrity and efficiency, aligning their actions more closely with the desires and needs of their constituents. It is a direct expression of democratic principles, ensuring that those elected to represent the people are continually subject to the will of the people. Furthermore, the recall should not be seen as an easy tool for political manipulation. It typically requires a significant number of signatures	1911	1988.8654
"An enabling act is now before the state legislature. ""The plans, which include the government appropriation for the Milwaukee harbour, should be carried forward."" The mayor commented favourably on the record of the city attorney's office. He found that when the present administration came into office damage suit claims of over $1,000, - ooo were pending against the city. Some of these were of seventeen years' standing. Furthermore, $280,000 in claims have been tried and dismissed; only one of the cases, covering $15,000, has been so far appealed to the Supreme Court. Before the existing government controlled Milwaukee the average total yearly settlement was $42,423."	This marked reduction in the city's liability is a testament to the efficacy of the current administration's legal strategies and their commitment to fiscal responsibility. The mayor also pointed out that the city attorney's office has not only been successful in defending against these claims but has also been proactive in preventing potential lawsuits through better policy implementation and oversight. In addition to the handling of damage suit claims, the mayor highlighted the city attorney's role in the drafting and advocacy of the enabling act currently under consideration. This legislation is crucial for the continuation and expansion of public works, including the significant developments planned for the Milwaukee harbour. The proposed improvements to the harbour are expected to enhance trade, bolster the local economy, and create numerous jobs, contributing to the overall prosperity of the city. The mayor emphasized the importance of state support through the enabling act to ensure that these plans come to fruition, thereby securing a better future for all residents of Milwaukee. With the city's legal affairs in competent hands and strategic plans underway, the mayor expressed optimism about the direction in which Milwaukee is headed. He reiterated his administration's dedication to maintaining transparency, reducing	1911	1999.6167
"..."" M. Le Texier presents his compliments to Mr. Garrick and begs him to be good enough to let him know whether it is true that he is to play next Wednesday, 29th inst., the 1 In the original French edition of this book the sources of information about Le Texier employed by us were Voltaire's Corresnon dance, that of Mme du Deft'and, that of Horace Walpole, the Uorr. Hit. of Qrimm, the Biographic Lyonnaite (Lyons, 1839), the Mens. Sees, of Bachamnont, vols. vi. and vii., the letters published by Boaden and those unpublished in the Forster Collection, and especially Paris, Versailles, et la Province, par un ancien officier aux gardes franchises (Paris, 1811, vol. i.). Since the publication of our essay M. Auguste Rondel, the well-known French theatrical scholar, and M. Th."	F. Gautier, director of the Archives de la Comédie-Française, have very kindly provided us with additional material which has greatly enriched our understanding of Le Texier's role in the French theatrical world of the eighteenth century. Their contributions have shed new light on his interactions with contemporary playwrights and actors, as well as his influence on theatrical practices of the time. Our further research into this period, facilitated by these new sources, reveals that Le Texier was not only a prominent figure in the vibrant cultural life of Paris but also played a significant role in the diffusion of French theatrical art across Europe. His correspondences indicate frequent communications with other major cultural centers, such as London and Vienna, suggesting his active involvement in a network that sought to elevate the standards and reach of theatrical performances. Moreover, the newly accessed archives include several critiques and reviews from Le Texier's performances at the Comédie-Française and other venues, which highlight his versatility and skill in both dramatic and comedic roles. These documents also reveal the public's admiration for his ability to captivate audiences	1912	1996.7924
"Let me say, in the first place, that nothing could have been kinder than the attention shown to me in the course of my visit. One of my first steps was to pay a visit to Cleveland. Ohio, where the "" Ncla "" Works and Laboratory of the General Electric Company (formerly known as the "" National Electric Lamp Association "") are situated. Here I met Mr. S. E. Doane, Dr. E. P.

The facilities provided for the staff include not only the usual amenities such as dining halls and rest areas, but also educational opportunities and recreational facilities, promoting not merely the physical, but also the intellectual and social well-being of every individual connected with the company. The laboratories themselves are equipped with the latest and most sophisticated apparatus, enabling the conduct of a wide array of experiments and research activities that push the boundaries of electrical engineering and light technology.  During my tour, I was particularly impressed by the rigorous testing procedures each product undergoes before it is deemed ready for the market. The commitment to quality and innovation was evident in every department, from design to production. It was clear that the company not only aims to lead in the market through advancements in technology but also through sustainability and efficiency which are increasingly becoming critical in global business practices. Furthermore, the collaborative atmosphere among the researchers and engineers was palpable. Ideas flowed freely in discussions that spanned from theoretical physics to practical application improvements. This environment fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement that is crucial for staying at the forefront of the industry. In summary,	1912	1963.8522

Similarly, in Thompson v. City of Louisville, 34 Ky. L. Rep. 1020 [1906], it was determined that the city had the authority to regulate activities that could potentially disrupt public order or safety, provided such regulations were not arbitrary or discriminatory in nature. Further examination can be found in the case of Smith v. City of St. Louis, 70 Mo. 593 [1880], where the court upheld the city's right to impose restrictions on businesses to preserve the welfare of the community. This principle was echoed in Brown v. City of Denver, 7 Colo. 305 [1883], which affirmed the city's power to regulate certain trades to prevent nuisances and maintain public health standards.

He sat down in the wicker rocker by the window. Far below in the streets there were bright lights and the shuffle of many feet. But Mr. Warner neither saw nor heard; he was estimating his failure — as a man who has let the good things of life pass him by. He had got nothing.

He sighed heavily, the weight of his despair pressing down upon him like a physical burden. Clara had often told him that she felt trapped, that their modest apartment was a prison to her. She wanted excitement, luxury, a life filled with the kind of splendor she read about in her magazines. All he could offer was his love, steadfast and true, but it was not enough. Not for Clara. Not for the world they lived in. The book—the one with the man who had done the unspeakable—lay open on his lap.

It is the surprising, unexpected occurrences which attract attention and demand to be accounted for. Now, primitive man has only one way of accounting for things : if something happens, somebody did it. Man has the power to do things. This remarkable thing therefore which has happened was done by some man. What is further remarkable about it is that, whereas in the ordinary course of things a man is seen to do what he does do, in this instance nobody was seen to do it.	Therefore, it must have been done by some man not visible to the eye—perhaps a spirit or a god. This is the foundation of the belief in supernatural beings, which is so widespread among primitive societies. As man's experience broadens and his knowledge increases, his explanations become more complex. But the fundamental impulse to attribute events to a personal agency remains a strong influence in his thought processes. In this way, early man personified natural forces as deities with human characteristics. Thunder became the voice of a god; the wind, the breath of spiritual beings. These anthropomorphic interpretations served not only to explain the mysteries of nature but also to establish a connection between the human and the divine, infusing the environment with a sense of personalism that made the universe relatable and somewhat predictable in human terms. As societies evolved, so did their mythologies and religious constructs, which became more elaborate, incorporating moral and ethical dimensions alongside explanatory functions. This anthropomorphism and personification provided a framework for communal norms and values, linking the community through shared narratives and rituals that reinforced social cohesion and collective identity	1908	1948.3434

"It is of this black and white oryx head that Roosevelt writes: ""A curious instance of the lengths to which some protective coloration theorists go is afforded by the fact that they actually treat these bold markings as obliterative or protective."" Colonel Roosevelt, like the rest of the world, seems never to have thought to find out how these patterns look from a lower level, such as lions and leopards necessarily see from, they being under three feet tall, while the oryx and zebra are nearer five. This great oversight invalidates almost all that has ever been written on this subject. 2'' African Game Trails, '' Appendix E.  21 could now see the deer, and all agreed that it was these white stripes that had fooled them."	When viewed from the perspective of a predator prowling through the underbrush, the stark contrasts of the oryx's markings blend into the light and shadow patterns created by sunlight filtering through the savannah grass. This deceptive appearance serves to break up the animal's outline, making it more challenging for predators to pinpoint its exact location or even recognize it as a potential prey at a distance. The effectiveness of such coloration is further demonstrated during the movement when the oryx's swift, darting escapes cause these stripes to blur, confusing the predator's visual perception and increasing the oryx's chances of evading capture. Thus, what may seem conspicuous and bold to the human eye, positioned much higher off the ground, turns into a sophisticated survival strategy when seen from the viewpoint of the oryx's natural adversaries. This phenomenon underscores the importance of considering environmental and interspecies interactions in the study of animal coloration, revealing a layer of complexity that often goes unnoticed in casual observations.	1911	2007.677
of glycerol instead of the alcohol used by Wollny. After heating with the glycerol and soda for eight minutes the fluid becomes clear and is allowed to cool to 80° C.; 90 cc. of water, at about the same temperature, and 50 cc. of 2-5 percent sulphuric acid are added. The rest of the process is as in the description given above. This is the official method in Germany. Clearly such estimations have a comparative value only, and even that only if the same conditions are always observed. 6  By sending a current of steam through the acid mixture figures that are 25 percent higher are obtained, but owing to the decomposition of non volatile acids by prolonged heating a source of error is introduced if the attempt be made to repeat the distillation by adding more water till the distillate no longer reacts acid.	This method, while providing a useful benchmark for comparative analysis, must be approached with caution due to the potential for variability in results based on minor deviations in procedure or the inherent characteristics of the sample being tested. The precision of the method largely depends on the strict adherence to the specified temperatures, concentrations, and timing. It is also important to ensure that all equipment used is properly calibrated and that reagents are of the highest purity to avoid introducing additional sources of error. For those seeking to implement this method in a laboratory setting, it is advisable to conduct preliminary trials to establish a baseline and adjust the process parameters as necessary to suit specific experimental conditions. Additionally, it is beneficial to run parallel tests using a known reference sample to validate the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained. This practice not only helps in fine-tuning the method but also provides a measure of confidence in the reproducibility of the data generated. Ultimately, while this glycerol-soda method is recognized officially in Germany and is a valuable tool for certain analytical purposes, its effectiveness is contingent upon meticulous experimental design and execution.

Out upon such counting-house incentive, such day book right and wrong, such adding machine altruism! No Socialist, however humble, but rises far above such concepts, but weighs them, finds them wanting, and sets them (where they belong) in the category of the untrue. Incentives are bound up with Individuality, and that, in turn, is at every point crushed down, deadened, rendered ineffective by the levelling tendencies of Capitalism. Thousands and millions of us perform the same drudgery day by day, month by month, year by year. In shop, mill, factory, mine, foundry; on railways, on the sea, on the farm, in the cities, what dreary, heartless reduction to one mean likeness of mediocrity!	Where is the room for the spirit to soar, for the mind to explore, for the heart to expand in such confines? Where is the recognition of the unique capabilities and aspirations of each human soul? Instead, we are met with the dull thud of conformity, the ceaseless repetition of the same tasks, the same words, the same thoughts, almost as if humanity itself were another cog in the vast machinery of production.  This is the grievous fault of Capitalism: it sees not the worker, but the working hands; not the person, but the productivity; not the dreamer, but the doer of deeds that often have no meaning beyond the ledger's bottom line. It reduces the rich tapestry of human experience to a mere exchange of labor for wages, a transaction devoid of any deeper human connection or purpose. Thus, the true incentive for any society that aspires to elevate itself above the mere accumulation of wealth must be to nurture the individuality of its members, to celebrate and support their diverse talents and passions, and to foster a community where every person is valued not for	1911	1920.8218

Resistance derivative! due to the gyroscopic action of the propeller and engine. — In reference to the standard axes the propeller axis lies along ox and positive rotations are such that, when a tractor screw is viewed from the pilot's seat the motion, if positive, is clockwise. If the screw is rotated from y to z (Fig. 4) with angular velocity Q the angular momentum is IQ, I being the moment of inertia of the rotating parts. This may be represented as a vector along the axis of x. If now the machine is yawing, ie., turning from x to y with an angular velocity r, the change of momentum in a time dt is jQrdl and is in the direction ab.	The vector product of the angular velocities Q and r results in a gyroscopic couple that acts perpendicular to the plane formed by these two vectors. This couple tends to oppose the yawing motion, which can have significant implications for the stability and control of the aircraft. The magnitude of the couple is given by the product of the moment of inertia, the angular velocity of the propeller (Q), and the angular velocity of the yaw (r), expressed as \( L = I \times Q \times r \). The direction of this couple, as determined by the right-hand rule, is along the axis of y if the initial propeller rotation is clockwise when viewed from the pilot's seat. This resistance to yawing due to the gyroscopic effect of the propeller is critical in the design and operation of aircraft, especially in scenarios involving rapid changes in flight direction or during maneuvers that involve significant yaw motions, such as turns. It is also a key factor in determining the handling characteristics of the aircraft, influencing how pilots must approach certain maneuvers to maintain control and stability. Furthermore, this gyroscopic action can	1912	1970.1923
They were entrained to Baldock, slightly east of Hitchin, where they marched out on the Icknield Way. These were followed by Fortescue's Brigade, who were also bound for Baldock and the neighbourhood. The bulk of the cavalry and field artillery of^both  divisions, together with the divisional troops, were compelled to set out by march route from Aldershot for the line of defences. The single and all sufficient reason of this delay in sending out the cavalry and artillery was owing to the totally inadequate accommodation on the railways for the transport of so many horses and guns.	The roads, churned into muck by the heavy wheels and hooves, became almost impassable in spots, causing frequent delays and a good deal of frustration among the men. Despite these challenges, the march was executed with a remarkable level of discipline and order, a testament to the training and resilience of the troops involved. As they moved through the countryside, local villagers lined the roads, offering whatever support they could—cups of tea, slices of bread, and sometimes just a cheer, which bolstered the spirits of the weary soldiers. Once arrived at their defensive positions, the troops began the arduous task of setting up camp and fortifying their positions. Trenches were dug, barbed wire was strung, and artillery pieces were carefully placed to cover the approaches. The landscape, once tranquil and pastoral, transformed into a bustling military encampment brimming with activity. Meanwhile, the logistical challenge of coordinating the movement of supplies to support such a large force in the field was immense. Wagons loaded with ammunition, food, and medical supplies trundled along the same rut	1906	1924.723
"Another shell, another and another, struck in our midst, utterly disorganising our defence, and each time making great breaches in our huge barricade. Neither Maxim nor rifle was of any use against those awful shells. "" I stood in the wrecked room covered with dust and blood, wondering what the end was to be. To fire my rifle in that moment was useless. Not only did the German artillery train their guns upon the barricade, but on the houses which we had placed in a state of defence. They pounded away at them, and in a few minutes had reduced several to ruins, burying in the debris the gallant Londoners defending them. The house upon the roof of which I had, earlier in the day, taken up my position, was struck by two shells in rapid succession, and simply demolished, over forty brave men losing their lives in the terrible catastrophe. "" Again the enemy, after wrecking our defences,  retired smartly up the hill as the terrible bombardment of London ceased."	The silence that followed was almost as harrowing as the bombardment itself. Dust hung thick in the air, obscuring the sun and casting a pall over the devastated streets. The cries of the wounded and the groans of the dying filled the eerie quiet, a stark reminder of the brutality of the attack. We scrambled from our positions, dazed and disoriented, to assess the damage and provide aid where we could. The scene was one of utter destruction; buildings that had stood for centuries were reduced to rubble, historic landmarks obliterated. As we moved through the debris, helping the injured and searching for survivors, the reality of our situation became painfully clear. The enemy's strategy was not only to destroy our physical defenses but to break our spirit, to demoralize us so completely that resistance would seem futile. But amidst the chaos and carnage, a different kind of resolve began to take shape among the survivors. Whispers of retaliation and rebuilding started to circulate, a defiant refusal to be cowed by terror. Our commanders, though shaken, quickly began to regroup and formulate a	1906	2002.8218
But the causes of this deterioration are patent, and would seem to be preventible. It is hardly justifiable to place them on a par with the diminishing efficiency of bodily metabolism which is an essential characteristic of every human being. They have never been shown to be universal characteristics of society. Many families of factory lords have continued their successful careers far beyond the proverbial three generations. And the persistence of national life among such a people as Jews, even without the help of any political organisation of their own, shows that it is possible to maintain the national spirit for an indefinite time and to counteract the tendencies hostile to its survival.	This suggests that the decline often observed in certain societies or groups may be more closely linked to environmental factors, societal structures, and specific policies rather than to an inherent natural law of decay. If we consider the factors that contribute to the longevity and prosperity of certain groups, such as the aforementioned Jews or long-standing business families, we see a pattern of strong community bonds, a focused preservation of culture and identity, and often, a strategic adaptation to changing circumstances. Furthermore, educational systems, economic policies, and social welfare structures play significant roles in either exacerbating or alleviating the pressures that lead to societal deterioration. For instance, communities that invest in robust education systems and create opportunities for economic mobility tend to sustain their vitality longer and resist the entropy that might otherwise be inevitable. Moreover, the role of leadership cannot be underestimated. Visionary leaders who prioritize the long-term well-being of their people over short-term gains can implement policies that strengthen the social fabric and build resilience against decline. This is evident in societies that have rebounded from crises through reform and innovation guided by principled leadership. Therefore, while biological factors	1908	2005.5577
= 0-008, and p — 0 078. Take a velocity of 50ft./sec. and a temperature difference 120 F. We have — •24 x 008 x 6 x 078 x 50 x 120 Fah H n ^ ^ or hp. equivalent: — •27 x 780 550 = '382 or say -4 (nearly). * Let a = sectional area of a uniform stratum that must be ' absorbed' by the plane to Account for the skin frictional resistance. Then Resistance = op Vs. Resistance also is given by expression ?Cp VA, (where A is area of plane, C normal plane resistance coefficient, and { doable surface coefficient of skin friction), or a = SCAT. Mass per sec. = apV =? cao V, or per sq.	ft. = cao. Given these parameters, we can now determine the required sectional area 'a' and the resistance it must absorb to account for the skin frictional resistance experienced by the plane. By setting these equations for resistance equal to each other, we find a relationship between the coefficients and the areas involved: \[ \rho V^2 s C_f A = \rho C_p V^2 A \] Where \( C_f \) is the skin friction coefficient and \( C_p \) is the pressure drag coefficient. Solving for the sectional area 'a', we get: \[ a = \frac{C_f}{C_p} A \] This gives us the effective area of the stratum that must be 'absorbed' to account for the skin friction. This analysis helps in understanding how changes in surface area, velocity, and coefficients of friction and pressure impact the overall resistance a plane faces while moving through the air at a given speed and temperature difference. It also underscores the importance of optimizing these parameters to reduce drag and improve efficiency in aircraft design and operation.	1912	1995.4271
"Upon trees in close proximity to each other were hanging the dead bodies of my five comrades, including poor Tom Martin. They presented a grim, ghastly spectacle. The Uhlans had strung them to trees, and afterwards riddled them with bullets ! "" Gradually, we were driven back upon London. Desperately we fought, each one of us, and the personal risk of every member of our club, of any other of the rifle clubs, and of the Frontiersmen, for the|matter of that, was very great. We were insufficient in numbers."	Our ammunition, too, was running low, and the enemy's forces were seemingly endless. They advanced with a relentless precision that spoke of superior organization and numbers. The streets of London, once bustling with life, were now echoing with the sound of gunfire and the cries of warfare. Buildings that had stood proud were now scarred with the marks of conflict, windows shattered and walls pocked with bullet holes. As we retreated through the maze of city streets, the grim reality set in. We were fighting a losing battle. Every corner turned could be our last, every shadow could conceal an enemy. Yet, despite the overwhelming odds, there was a fierce determination among us. This was our city, our home, and if we were to fall, we would do so defending it. The air was thick with smoke and the acrid smell of gunpowder. The sky, once clear, was now a murky haze of grey. The sounds of the distant artillery were a constant reminder of the enemy's advance. We moved stealthily, utilizing every bit of cover we could find, from overturned carts to	1906	1994.3315
"Not a man in South London will shirk his duty to the Empire. The future, whether England shall still remain Mistress of the World, lies with us. It is that important all present fact that the League of Defenders is impressing upon us from all the hoardings, and it is also the fact which stimulates each one of us to bear our part in the defence of our homes and our loved ones. "" Germany shall yet rue the day when she launched her legions upon us."" Life in London north of the Thames at that moment  was more exciting than that within the fortress of South London. In the latter, everyone was waiting in hunger and patience the march of events, while north of the river the ever present Germans in foraging parties were a constant source of annoyance and anger."	The streets were filled with the sounds of marching feet, the clatter of horse hooves, and the rumble of artillery moving to positions. The air was tense with the anticipation of conflict, and the citizens, though wearied by constant vigilance, were determined in their resolve. Barricades were erected at strategic points, sandbags piled high against windows and doors, and every able-bodied man was enlisted to contribute to the defense efforts. Even the women and children assisted, supplying food and water to the defenders or helping to fortify buildings. The League of Defenders, a volunteer organization, had grown rapidly in numbers and influence. They patrolled the neighborhoods, organized local militias, and conducted drills. Posters and flyers, emblazoned with calls to arms and patriotic slogans, were ubiquitous, reinforcing the gravity of the situation and the need for unity and resilience. Amidst this chaos, the spirit of camaraderie flourished. Neighbors who had once been strangers now bonded over shared duties and the common goal of protecting their city.

"But to give more than a fraction of them even a smattering of vernacular education is more than the protecting Government can achieve. It is inexpedient to ask whether or not the bureaucracy in general, or the upper authorities in particular, desire to see the masses in India schooled. Taking simply the inductive method that would be followed in any judicial inquiry as to home administration, we are however forced to conclude that no such ideal guides our Indian administration as is supposed to govern the policy of most European Governments. In home politics, all parties profess to applaud the maxim that ""where there is no light the people perish."" It is acclaimed as a religious truth alike by those who maintain the Nonconformist ideal of religious education and by those who insist upon the Anglican."	Yet, in the administration of India, the same fervor for education appears notably absent, or at least significantly subdued. The colonial policy, it seems, operates under a different set of principles, where the illumination of the masses is not deemed as imperative as it is within the metropolitan boundaries. This divergence perhaps roots from a variety of complex socio-political reasons, including the vastness of the population, the diversity of languages and cultures, and perhaps an underlying apprehension regarding the empowerment of the colonized through knowledge. Indeed, it can be argued that the educational policies that are implemented are often more aligned with the needs of the administration rather than the educational upliftment of the populace. The focus predominantly lies on producing a small class of educated locals who can assist in administrative tasks rather than fostering a widespread educational movement. This class, while educated, remains tightly controlled and is often imbued with values and ideologies that serve to reinforce the colonial structure. Furthermore, the type of education dispensed is frequently more vocational in nature, aimed at producing clerks and interpreters rather than thinkers and innovators. The curriculum	1908	1968.7063
When we send a general out to lead a war, we have no right to blame him for getting his men killed, unless we can prove a very serious carelessness on his part; and it must be remembered that a soldier is compelled to go into action even against his judgement, whereas the members of the YV.S.P.U. are, in every case, free agents. Having said my say, allow me to congratulate you on the appearance of THE FREEWOMAN. I had been longing for an English feminist paper, ajid I find yours stimulating, although I do not find myself quite in harmony with the editorial attitude on sex, and especially marriage. However, perhaps it is too soon to judge, and I prefer to keep my opinions until they are digested, and perhaps later on you will allow me to give them a vent. (Mrs.) SOPHY GUDINI.	Your initiative in launching such a publication is commendable, and it is indeed heartening to see issues pertaining to women's rights and freedoms being discussed with such fervor and insight. The discourse on sex and marriage is, as always, a complex and polarizing subject, yet it is precisely these challenging topics that need to be addressed openly to pave the way for meaningful societal change. It is only through such dialogue that we can hope to dissect the varied perspectives and experiences that form the fabric of our collective understanding of these issues. I look forward to future editions of THE FREEWOMAN and to the evolution of its editorial stance as it continues to provoke thought, invite controversy, and inspire action. It is through such platforms that the movement can hope to challenge existing norms and advocate for the rights and recognition that women rightfully deserve. Meanwhile, I will continue to reflect on these matters and gather my thoughts, hoping to contribute to your valuable publication in the near future. Yours sincerely, (Mrs.) SOPHY GUDINI	1911	2004.1965
The arrangement for starting the tubo is also novel. The tube need not be rocked, a development of the static discharge method being employed to set the lamp going. The specific consumption is given as about J watt per mean lower hemispherical c. p. GAS, OIL, AND ACETYLENE LIGHTING. During the past month a lecture was delivered by J. ABADY on Light and Competition (OW., May 11; J.G.L., May 14). The author presents figures for the cost of gas and electric lighting, in the course of which the results of some tests on metal filament lamps (giving 1'42-1'Sl watts per c. p.) are given. Discussing the possibilities of future progress, the author suggests that in the case of electricity greater efficiencies will be secured by the use of luminescent vapours, while in the case of gas, although there may be no immediate prospect of any vast improvement in the quality of the gas itself, there are great possibilities in the improvements of burners. More attention should also be given to methods of altering the distribution and colour of the light from gas lamps.	The lecture also touched upon the advancements in oil and acetylene lighting, which, while often overshadowed by the rapid developments in electrical illumination, still hold significant importance in certain contexts. Mr. Abady pointed out that for remote areas and in situations where the infrastructure for electricity is lacking, oil and acetylene lighting provide viable and economical alternatives. He highlighted the recent improvements in the design and efficiency of oil lamps and acetylene generators, which have made them more user-friendly and safer than before. In terms of oil lighting, advancements have been made in the refinement of the oils used, which now burn cleaner and with less odor. The wick design has also been improved for more consistent flame and better light output. For acetylene lighting, the focus has been on enhancing the carbide to water ratio controls in generators, thus optimizing gas production and minimizing waste. Mr. Abady concluded by emphasizing the need for continued research in all forms of lighting technology. He advocated for a balanced approach that does not solely focus on one type of lighting but considers the roles and benefits of various lighting systems	1912	1997.1055
Do not read facing the light. Don'T judge illumination by the brightness of the lamps. Do not think because a lamp looks glaring and brilliant that it is giving you a good light. It may be merely giving too much light in the wrong place. On the other hand a well shaded lamp may look dim because it is well shaded, and may still be giving a first class light to work by. Avoid excessive contrast. If you use a table lamp to provide a strong local illumination, do not leave the rest of the room in complete darkness. Provide a moderate general illumination. Use the right type of globe, shade, or reflector. Some forms of globes and reflectors are intended to diffuse the light evenly in all directions, others concentrate the light mainly in one particular direction.	Ensure that the type you choose corresponds to the needs of your space and the activities you intend to perform there. For example, a diffusing globe is well-suited for general room lighting, while a directional reflector might be better for tasks like reading or detailed craftwork. Furthermore, consider the color temperature of the light. Warmer tones, which mimic the glow of incandescent bulbs, are often more comforting in living spaces, whereas cooler, daylight-like tones might be more effective in a workspace as they help in reducing eye strain and improving concentration. Additionally, take care of the placement of your light sources. They should be positioned in such a way that they do not cast shadows on your work or create glare on reflective surfaces like computer screens or glossy magazines. Ideally, if you are right-handed, your light source should be placed to the left side of your workspace to minimize shadows cast by your hand and vice versa for left-handed individuals. Lastly, ensure that your lighting setup is flexible. Adjustable lamps are invaluable as they can be repositioned according to the task at hand or the time of	1912	2006.4429
"Nothing but one thing — the sense of quality, the sense that a woman has gifts, the sense that she is a superior, a master — can give her the strength to slip the comfort and protection and to be content to seize the "" love "" in passing, to suffer the long strain of effort, and to bear the agony of producing creative work. Having this sense, they will learn that freedom is born in the individual soul, and that no outer force can either give it or take it away; that only Freewomen can be free, or lead the way to freedom. They will learn that their freedom will consist in appraising their own worth, in setting up their own standards and living up to them, and putting behind them for ever their role of complacent self sacrifice. For none can judge of another soul's value. The individual has to record its own."	The realization of self-worth and the pursuit of personal standards is not a journey marked by ease, but rather one of relentless self-discovery and determination. In this pursuit, women must cast aside the societal expectations that seek to define their value and limit their capabilities. By embracing their intrinsic qualities and unique potential, they affirm their independence and contribute to a broader societal transformation. In this context, the role of education becomes paramount, not merely academic, but education in its broadest sense: learning to understand oneself, to value one’s insights and to develop the courage to stand alone if necessary. This education fosters critical thinking, nurtures emotional intelligence, and cultivates the resilience required to face the trials that accompany any path of genuine independence. Moreover, as women engage in this process of self-affirmation and development, they inevitably influence those around them. They become role models for other women, demonstrating that it is possible to live authentically and freely. This ripple effect can transform communities and, eventually, societies. Therefore, the quest for personal freedom and the expression of one’s true self should	1911	2007.1807
ABDE is, as before, the frontal surface; BCD is a cross section which is enlarged in the lower sketch. A depth of 2000 feet of cold air occurs much farther from the surface front than in either the stationary or cold fronts, indicating a very shallow wedge of cold air. Warm front slopes are considerably less than either of the other two types. It is not too unusual to find a warm front slope of 1 to 500. One reason for the shallow slope lies in the presence of warm air parcels moving with high velocities against the cold air below the frontal surface. FRONTAL FEATURES IMPORTANT TO OPERATIONS. — Perhaps the most important fact to remember about a front is that it is a very real discontinuity between airmasses, whose parcels have differing directions of mo  tion and practically always possess differences in temperature and moisture content.	These differences can lead to significant weather phenomena, including precipitation, cloud formation, and severe weather events such as thunderstorms or even tornadoes. The convergence zone where these contrasting air masses meet often becomes a breeding ground for cyclogenesis, the development of a cyclone, which can further intensify the weather changes. Another critical aspect of fronts is their impact on aviation. Pilots must be acutely aware of the location and movement of fronts to anticipate changes in weather conditions, such as turbulence, icing conditions, and shifts in wind direction and speed. Navigation and flight planning must consider these factors to ensure safety and efficiency in flight operations. Moreover, fronts play a crucial role in determining the air quality. As they move, fronts can carry pollutants and disperse them over wide areas, affecting air quality across different regions. Similarly, a front can bring in cleaner, fresher air from another area, significantly improving air quality. Understanding the dynamic nature of fronts and their associated weather patterns is essential for weather forecasting. Meteorologists use data from satellites, weather stations, and aircraft to track these fronts and predict their	1913	2004.826

Betty's mood had shifted swiftly from irritation to admiration of millinery, a change so quick it nearly gave me whiplash. However, knowing her as I did, this wasn't entirely out of character. ""Perhaps you should get some,"" I suggested, following her gaze to the bolt of crepe. ""It does look quite warm, and the texture is quite elegant."" Betty tilted her head, considering.

ART. 78] 153 Overhanging Ends. — For points between two supports a distance / apart the work would be just as before, except that at eacn support would be equal to the bending moment due to the overhanging end instead of zero. Propped Beam. — If this beam were propped by a central support to the same level as the ends, the central deflection becomes zero, or, in other words, the upward deflection caused by the reaction of the prop (and proportional to it) is equal to the downward deflection caused by the load at the middle of the span.	This additional support changes the nature of the bending moment diagram for the beam. Typically, a simply supported beam without a central prop would exhibit a maximum negative bending moment at mid-span due to the applied load. However, with a central prop, the bending moments at the supports become more complex, involving both positive and negative values, and the maximum bending moment shifts away from the center. In calculating the reactions at the supports, including the central prop, it is necessary to apply the conditions for static equilibrium: the sum of vertical forces and the sum of moments about any point must both be zero. This leads to a set of simultaneous equations based on the geometry of the beam and the locations of the loads. The influence of the prop also extends to the shear force diagram. The presence of the central prop introduces a point of zero shear, changing the linear progression of shear force across the beam. This zero point divides the beam into two segments, each behaving as a separate beam with its respective loading conditions and support reactions. Moreover, the deflection profile of the beam is significantly altered by the central prop. The	1908	1991.2441

From this / may be calculated if E is known. If, as a particular case, we take h = o, the equation — 2EVV(>4 + 8/) volume of bar .	reduces to \( f = \frac{2EW}{A} \), which is the familiar expression for the stress in a bar due to a static load W, evenly distributed over a cross-sectional area A, when the bar is assumed to be perfectly rigid. Continuing from the general case where \( h \neq 0 \), we can further simplify the expression by considering the practical applications where \( \delta l \) is indeed very small relative to \( h \). Thus, the term \( \delta l \) in \( h + \delta l \) can be neglected for a first approximation, leading to \( f \approx \frac{2EW}{A} \cdot \frac{h}{h} = \frac{2EW}{A} \). This approximation is valid under the assumption that the deformation \( \delta l \) does not significantly alter the height through which the weight falls. To apply this theoretical framework in a practical engineering context, we must ensure that the material properties, such as the modulus of elasticity \( E \), and the dimensions of	1908	1991.0822
The conditions of exposure on the laboratory roof, where the fabric is not only in the open all day, but is also regularly subjected to the action of moisture, are obviously much more severe than those to which the actual machine would be subjected. 289 (iii) From Fig. 13. A very large drop in strength is observed in the unvarnished fabric after 21 days' exposure, but the effect of further exposure is less pronounced. The total extension varies only very slightly, but at low stresses an important change is observed, eg., comparing curves a and d at a stress of 250 kgs. per metre, in one case the extension is 12J percent, and in the other 16 percent. (iv) From Fig. 14. The first period of 21 days has diminished the strength of the treated fabric No.	2 by approximately 15 percent. However, subsequent exposure up to 42 days shows a much more stable behavior with only a minor additional reduction in strength. This suggests that the initial period of exposure is critical for establishing the long-term durability of the treated fabric. The resilience of the fabric to further degradation after this initial period indicates that the treatment has a significant protective effect against the harsh conditions. (v) From Fig. 15. The comparison between treated and untreated fabrics over a 60-day period clearly demonstrates the benefits of the treatment. The untreated fabric shows a continuous decline in tensile strength, losing nearly 30 percent of its initial strength by the end of the period. In contrast, the treated fabric stabilizes after the initial drop and maintains roughly 85 percent of its original strength, showcasing the effectiveness of the protective treatment in mitigating the wear caused by environmental factors. (vi) From Fig. 16. Analysis of the elasticity modulus indicates that the treatment also helps in preserving the fabric’s elasticity. While the untreated fabric shows a significant increase in stiffness, likely due to the breakdown of fibers	1912	2001.9376

The photographs, taken from different angles, capture the deportee's distinguishing features, ensuring that his identity could be verified with precision in any future encounters. The Bertillon system, named after its creator, Alphonse Bertillon, is renowned for its detailed approach to the anthropometric measurement and documentation of individuals. This method not only includes photographic records but also meticulously measured body parts and distinctive marks, such as scars or tattoos, which are carefully noted on the card. The reverse side of the registration card provides spaces for additional comments on the individual's physical appearance, demeanor, and any other observations that might aid in future identification. This could include peculiarities in gait, posture, or even habitual expressions. The thoroughness of the Bertillon system has made it a crucial tool in criminal identification, allowing for a level of detail and accuracy that was unprecedented at the time of its development. Moreover, the system's influence extended beyond the field of criminal anthropology into various administrative and regulatory areas, demonstrating its versatility and the broad applicability of systematic data collection and categorization in managing identities in increasingly complex societies.	1913	2007.0677

In a similar vein, expert testimony is generally not admissible to establish the standards of care in professional services unless the witness is shown to have relevant experience or knowledge in that particular profession. This principle is rooted in the need for reliability and relevance in expert testimony, ensuring that opinions provided are based on a substantial foundation within the specific field in question. Furthermore, in cases involving technical or scientific matters, the testimony of a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may indeed be received. However, such testimony is confined strictly to the area of expertise. For instance, a mechanical engineer would not be permitted to offer expert opinions on medical procedures unless he or she possesses requisite qualifications and experience in the medical field. Experts may provide opinions on factual matters where their scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. However, they may not provide opinions on legal conclusions that will determine the outcome of the case—as such determinations are reserved for the judge or	1913	1956.5688
Notwithstanding those strong advisory votes in the state of Illinois, the legislature has refused to put before the people the measures which such overwhelming majorities demanded. If the vote of the people of Illinois could be expressed, after the exposition of the corruption in the legislature of that state, which has recently been investigated by grand juries, I have no doubt that the initiative and referendum would be carried by a vote as large as that with which it was carried in Oregon. Initiative and referendum laws have been adopted in cities in the Union by overwhelming majorities. They were adopted in Los Angeles by a vote of 12,105 to 1,955, or a vote of si to one The movement in California which was started by Los Angeles has been followed in that state by the cities of Sacramento, San Bernadino, San Diego, Pasadena, Eureka, Santa Monica, Alameda, Santa Cruz, Long Beach, Riverside, Santa Barbara, Palo Alto, Richmond and Berkeley.	The enthusiasm for direct democracy, as evidenced by these figures, reflects a growing discontent with traditional legislative processes perceived as slow, unresponsive, or corrupted by special interests. In states and cities where initiative and referendum have been implemented, citizens have taken a more active role in governance, proposing and voting on legislation directly. This shift towards grassroots participation is transforming the political landscape, empowering the average voter and reducing the influence of lobbyists and political insiders. In Oregon, the success of the initiative and referendum system has not only led to significant legislative changes but has also sparked a nationwide interest in adopting similar measures. The state's ability to enact laws directly by the people—for issues ranging from tax reforms to environmental protections—has been viewed as a model of democratic engagement. The process allows for a more dynamic and immediate response to public needs and concerns, bypassing the often gridlocked state legislative bodies. The spread of this movement across California cities highlights a regional trend towards greater civic engagement and public oversight of government actions. Each city, while unique in its specific implementations and the issues it addresses, contributes to a broader narrative of increasing	1911	2004.4666
"This is the lesson from the present physical condition of Mars. On the other hand, the continual progress of civilisation upon Mars, and the very high development attained there, coupled with what we know of our own progress during the ages past, give certainty to the hope that our own civilisation will continue to develop, slowly indeed, but surely ; and also to the belief that, compared to what it will be in the future, our present stage of civilisation is merely savagery. Development will lead to progress in everything which tends to increase the intelligence, wisdom, and happiness of the whole human race. Our world has seen the rise and fall of many civilisations, but fresh ones have risen, phoenix like, from the ashes of those which have departed and been forgotten. ""The individual withers, "" but ""the world is more and more."" As it was in the past, so will it be in the future — ever changing, ever passing, but ever renewing, until the final stage is reached."	This final stage, we may conjecture, will be one of such advanced knowledge and understanding that the problems which now vex and divide humanity may seem trivial by comparison. The course of evolution, both cultural and biological, suggests a future where the potential of human intellect and compassion might be realized to its fullest extent. As the Martian example hints, it may not be mere utopian fancy to imagine a society where the conflicts that arise from scarcity, misunderstanding, and unbridled self-interest are significantly ameliorated by advances in technology and social organization. The vision of Mars, with its apparent canals and signs of order, challenges us to consider the possibilities of our own planet. What strides might we make if our efforts were united, if the energies now expended on conflict were redirected towards understanding and cooperation? The Martian civilization, as perceived through our telescopes, stands as a silent testament to the potential heights a united world might reach. Just as the astronomers peer through their lenses to unveil the mysteries of Mars, so too must we endeavor to look beyond the immediate horizon of our current struggles and limitations.	1911	1974.984
So far as the elector was concerned, the great principle was that no vote was wasted, that every vote sooner or later must be used. As a rule they had a large number of candidates in each constituency. Just two years ago they had an election under this system, and while there were six members to be elected in each of the five divisions, there were 16 candidates in one, and in the others 13, 12, 10 and 9 respectively. It had been objected that the number of informal votes under this system was likely to be very largely increased: that was not their experience. They had only 2.86 percent of the votes throughout the whole state declared informal, and it was to be remembered that the whole system was new.	The arrangement, in fact, had been met with considerable approval. The electors had adapted quickly to the new method, which allowed for a more representative outcome and decreased the likelihood of disenfranchisement. This proportional representation, as it was termed, ensured that even smaller parties or less popular candidates who had a significant following could gain representation proportional to the amount of votes they received. This was a marked improvement over the previous winner-takes-all system where many votes essentially did not contribute to the final outcome. Moreover, the process of counting the votes, although slightly more complex due to the need to redistribute preferences according to voters' second, third choices, and so forth, was handled efficiently. The electoral officials were trained extensively prior to the election, which helped in managing the process smoothly and kept the rate of errors low. This training, coupled with public education campaigns about how to properly fill out the ballots, was instrumental in keeping the percentage of informal votes low. The success of this system in reducing wasted votes and increasing voter satisfaction was evident. Discussions were already underway about expanding this voting system to other	1911	1985.329

The values of the modulus of section are critical for calculating the stress distribution and bending moments in structural components. For example, consider a beam with a rectangular cross section, the modulus of section Z can be calculated as: \[ Z = \frac{I}{c} \] where \( I \) is the moment of inertia about the neutral axis, and \( c \) is the distance from the neutral axis to the outermost fiber, typically half the depth of the beam. For a rectangular section, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by: \[ I = \frac{bh^3}{12} \] where \( b \) is the breadth, and \( h \) is the depth of the rectangle. Consequently, the modulus of section \( Z \) becomes: \[ Z = \frac{bh^2}{6} \] This formula indicates that the bending strength of the beam increases with the square of its depth, highlighting the importance of beam geometry in structural design. For other shapes such as circular or I-beams, the calculation of \( I \)	1908	1984.5409
"In this he is, of course, largely at one with Robert Owen and others; but on the whole this is not the most prominent consideration with Socialists in general. In connexion with this question, it should be noted that Mr. Wells does not by any means ignore the difficulty that naturally occurs to most minds as involved in the point of view here suggested. ""A State, "" he says (p. 216) ""that undertakes to sustain all the children born into it will do its best to secure good births. That implies a distinct bar to the marriage and reproduction of the halt and the blind, the bearers of transmissible diseases and the like."""	He goes on to emphasize the need for a careful and systematic approach to eugenics, a concept that was gaining traction in his time. Wells was aware of the ethical and practical complexities involved in implementing such policies. He argued that while the state has a role in promoting the health and well-being of its population, it must also respect individual freedoms and rights. This balance, he suggests, could be achieved through education and voluntary measures rather than coercion. Wells envisioned a society where individuals are informed and encouraged to make responsible choices regarding reproduction, supported by a state that provides the necessary resources and education to facilitate these decisions. Moreover, Wells was critical of the laissez-faire attitudes of his contemporaries, asserting that the state should actively intervene to prevent the perpetuation of poverty and illness, which he saw as avoidable through social and scientific progress. This proactive stance, he believed, would not only lead to healthier individuals but also to a more robust and efficient society, capable of achieving greater things. His views, while progressive in some respects, also reflected the tensions and controversies of his era concerning the role	1908	2007.4503

This fitting is on somewhat similar lines to Fig. 1, but for the lower reflector Fiq. 5. — Showing method of obtaining the even illumination in Fig. 4. opaque glass is used, thus allowing part only of the light to be reflected. It will have been noticed that during the past year this method, more especially for window lighting, has been adopted with great success by quite a number of our best West End shops. This has resulted in extremely good illumination, and has also in many cases reduced the amount of current consumed. The first scheme to which I wish to draw your attention is the installation recently put in at the Kodak Company's premises in Kingsway.	Here, the arrangement involves an innovative use of upward facing lights which are recessed into the ceiling. This design not only hides the direct source of light, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the interior, but also efficiently distributes the illumination across the room. The use of mirrored reflectors and diffusing panels further ensures that the light is evenly spread, avoiding harsh shadows and glare which can often be problematic in retail settings. In addition to the aesthetic benefits, this system also boasts remarkable energy efficiency. By incorporating LED technology, the Kodak installation sees a significant decrease in energy consumption compared to traditional lighting methods. The LEDs provide a high lumen output while using less power, contributing to lower operational costs over time. Furthermore, the flexibility of this setup allows for adjustable lighting conditions. This is particularly advantageous in a retail environment like Kodak's, where different areas may require varied lighting levels to highlight specific products or create a particular mood. This approach to screened lighting not only meets the practical needs of modern retail but also aligns with contemporary design trends that favor minimalism and subtlety. It's clear that as	1912	2007.0945

St. 519, 22 Atl. 1045; and numerous other cases cited in the footnotes to section 143 of the Restatement of Contracts. It is well settled that any new promise or acknowledgment sufficient to interrupt the statute of limitations must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive. The new promise or acknowledgment must manifest an intention to pay the debt and thereby revive the obligation. The effect of such a new promise is to start anew the period of limitation, giving the creditor a fresh period within which to institute legal action. The law also recognizes that a part payment on a debt can similarly serve as an acknowledgment of the debt, thus reviving the statute of limitations. This principle is based on the rationale that part payment indicates the debtor's recognition of the debt as a subsisting obligation, and an intention to discharge it. This action resets the statute of limitations from the date of the part payment, provided the payment is voluntarily made and accepted by the creditor as such. Furthermore, courts have often found that even a verbal acknowledgment of debt	1913	1933.135
"Lest the wife should forget, she keeps on telling her. I wish all adventurers in life were so eager to put all their cards on the table! Of course, the obvious reply was, "" Take him, and may he bore you as much as he has me."" But, bless me, that would be original, and we must always observe the seven deadly virtues — which exist only on the stage and the veneer of them in the profession. Also Mr. Sutro has taken enormous trouble to accentuate the wife's complete lack of humour (I expect he would deny this, but it really makes it all the worse if he did it unconsciously). Now, there is every reason to believe that the wicked adventuress had no real designs on the straw doctor."	She was merely playing a game, a dangerous game perhaps, but one that amused her and kept the boredom at bay. Her real interest lay not in the conquest but in the sport of the chase. The doctor, for all his earnestness and professional dedication, was but a pawn in her intricate dance of social manipulation. It was the thrill of the hunt, the manipulation of emotions and events, that truly captivated her. And yet, the doctor, oblivious to the undercurrents, took every flutter of her eyelash, every seemingly accidental touch, as a sign of genuine affection or interest. His naivety, while endearing to some, only served to make him a more appealing target for her games. He was like a moth to the flame, drawn in by the light but unaware of the impending danger. The wife, on the other hand, was not so easily fooled. She saw through the veneer of charm and politeness that the adventuress expertly wielded. But what could she do? To accuse without proof would be to expose herself to ridicule and to strain	1911	1970.9696
"I hope you will not find me bigoted to our errors, for we have a multitude; but then I hope I may, without offence, endeavour to convince our good neighbours (who think that there is no salvation out of their own dramatic pale) that we have merits which their prejudices blind them from seeing, or the ignorance of our language and manners will ever make them incapable of tasting. I will venture to prove that there is not one French author, from their highest, Voltaire, down to their lowest, abbe"" Le Blanc, who understands accurately any three speeches together of Shakespeare; and yet these are the gentlemen from whom the nation in general takes their ideas of our theatre. The absurd blunders of the abbe are not worthy of criticism, but it That is, his World, published in three volumes, 1768."	is Voltaire's criticisms that have led many astray. He, who so often praised Shakespeare for his genius, failed to grasp the full depth and breadth of that genius. Voltaire looked through the lens of classical French drama, with its strict adherence to the unities of time, place, and action, and found Shakespeare wanting for his disregard of these rules. Yet, it is in this very disregard that Shakespeare's strength lies; his plays are a mirror to nature, not confined by the artificial constraints of classical drama. The French critics, guided by Voltaire, criticize Shakespeare for his plots which they find convoluted, and his characters which they consider overdrawn. They accuse him of mixing the tragic with the comic, the grave with the trivial, thereby violating the purity of genre. But these are not flaws; they are a testament to Shakespeare's understanding of the complexity of human life, which does not adhere to simple categories or predictable paths. Shakespeare's characters are not mere caricatures or ideals, but living, breathing individuals, flawed and multifaceted. They are driven by	1912	1914.8005
"Marks are given for industry and good conduct.

Report by the Comptroller general of Prisons, New South Wales. 1907 (for year 1906), p. 2.  . . ."	"This somewhat paradoxical instruction highlights the strict and often inflexible nature of the penal system at the time, which sought to maintain rigorous control while still offering a semblance of fairness through ministerial review. The rules further state that ""Good conduct marks are to be awarded monthly and can be forfeited for any misbehavior, negligence, or breach of prison regulations. Accumulation of these marks may lead to certain privileges such as increased correspondence rights, additional visiting hours, and, in some cases, recommendation for earlier parole consideration by the parole board."" It is also noted in the document that ""All prisoners, regardless of their classification, are required to engage in some form of labour, as it is considered beneficial not only to the institution but to the prisoners themselves, promoting habits of industry and reducing the monotony of prison life."" The type of work assigned is generally dependent on the physical and mental capacity of the prisoner, as well as the needs of the institution. Furthermore, the rules emphasize the importance of rehabilitation, stating, ""Education and moral instruction shall be afforded to all prisoners, with classes conducted by qualified"	1908	1979.3945
"Trees more than one year old are not desirable for orchard planting. At the North peach trees should be set out in the spring. The distance apart will  Fig. 100. Pruning peach trees, a.

Some growers put out twice as many trees as can grow well to maturity. In such cases they must be thinned out when they commence to crowd one another. Pruning. On inferior soils, such as those of parts of the peach region of Michigan and the Maryland peninsula, it is customary to do but little pruning and the trees are allowed to branch close to the ground and form rangy heads."	However, in regions with richer soil, more systematic pruning is often practiced to encourage a stronger, more compact tree structure. This involves removing weaker or overlapping branches and ensuring that the tree's canopy allows light and air to penetrate, which is crucial for the health of the tree and the quality of the fruit it produces. The primary objective of pruning should be to establish a strong framework of main branches while maintaining the overall shape of the tree. The recommended approach is to select three to five main branches that are evenly spaced around the trunk and angle upwards at about 45 degrees. This helps to balance the tree and prevent branches from shading each other as they grow. During the early years of a peach tree's life, pruning should be more aggressive to shape the tree and promote a strong, healthy structure. As the tree matures, maintenance pruning to remove dead or diseased wood and thin out dense areas will be more prevalent. It's also important to cut back branches that are too vigorous, as they can sap energy from the fruit-bearing parts of the tree. In addition to structural pruning, peach trees benefit from	1914	2006.2417
Corp’ns ,5 912 and Kirchman v. West & S. T. Ry. Co., 58111. note; see also 15 Amer. & Eng. Ency. App. 515.	The principle laid down in these cases is that a corporation, being a legal entity distinct from the individuals who compose it, can enter contracts and may sue or be sued in its own right. This separation of identity is fundamental in the corporate law doctrine known as 'corporate veil', which shields the personal assets of the shareholders from corporate liabilities under most circumstances. However, this veil can be pierced if the corporation is found to be a mere alter ego of its owners, particularly in cases of fraud or when statutory formalities have not been observed. In Kirchman v. West & S. T. Ry. Co., the court examined the conditions under which the corporate veil might be disregarded. The ruling emphasized that mere ownership of all or most of a corporation’s stock by one or few individuals is not itself sufficient to justify piercing the corporate veil. Instead, there must be evidence of misuse of the corporate form to perpetrate fraud, circumvent law, or achieve some other wrongful purpose. This doctrine is critical in ensuring that while corporations can act as separate legal entities, they do not serve as instruments	1913	1967.2649

But true happiness does not mean mere exciting of pleasure. True happiness is the unity of our inner life. If all of our strivings and experiences are in harmony with one another and the whole manifoldness of our inner state becomes a unity in itself, a moving equilibrium, in which new and ever new will acts harmonious with the conditions of life are unfolding themselves — then indeed true happiness is reached. The satisfaction which it brings has the same absolute value which perfect beauty has. Yes, happiness has its true place among the aesthetic values. It means the perfect beauty of the state of our soul, and the world is endlessly richer in its inner beauty by the fact that happiness glows in human souls.	This conception of happiness transcends mere pleasurable sensations. It is not something that can be chased down or manufactured through external means, but rather it emerges from the deep waters of a well-ordered soul. It is akin to the calm that follows the alignment of one's actions with one's deepest values and beliefs, a state where conflict within the self ceases and gives way to a profound peace. In this state, every breath, every moment becomes infused with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. The trivial distractions and the fleeting shadows of discontent that so often plague the human mind lose their power. The person who achieves this harmony lives not in pursuit of happiness, but from a place of happiness. Each action and decision flows naturally from this inner reservoir of peace, contributing not only to one's own well-being but also to the well-being of others around. Thus, happiness, in its truest form, is both a personal achievement and a communal blessing. It enhances the bearer's life and naturally extends its benefits outward, enriching the broader tapestry of human experience. It is the ultimate expression of	1909	1962.0381
"And, in passing, kt me point out to those who believe vaguely that a "" love child "" is the finest type that can be born, that this is only true in so far as the atmosphere in which the potential mother spends her months of pregnancy is one of love and unruffled calm. And then a first child is very often not as fine a specimen as subsequent ones, from the fact that in undergoing such a tremendous adventure the new mother is naturally anxious, and the child suffers accordingly. Unfortunately, Life is often hard upon this form of romance. Ostracism, then, is responsible for a poor type of child. But that is not all. In too many cases the girl has to keep herself, and it is mighty difficult to get a job without a character."	"She may find herself in menial positions, struggling with physical exhaustion and emotional turmoil, which are hardly conducive to the healthy development of her unborn child. The stress of having to fend for herself and her child alone, without the support of a community or the father, can lead to further complications, both mentally and physically. This harsh reality starkly contrasts with the idyllic notion of a child born out of a profound love. Moreover, the societal stigma attached to unwed mothers can exacerbate the situation, leading to isolation and a lack of necessary healthcare. The romanticized view of the ""love child"" does not consider these socio-economic factors that can significantly impact the health and well-being of both mother and child. It is essential to recognize that while the circumstances of conception might be rooted in love, the real-world challenges and prejudices can lead to outcomes that are far from ideal. Thus, support systems and societal understanding need to evolve to provide better care and acceptance for these mothers and their children."	1911	2004.1692
"She wrote lying on the path, slowly, all up and down in Siamese. Day the 15th, October, year 113. "" This is to let Kru know. No one is here. They have all gone to the Tewadah Palace. Only Dulayut is left behind: she is unhappy."" The sense of her wrongs overcame her afresh as she wrote, and the square Siamese characters went sloping up and down. But she signed her name firmly in Siamese, and clinched it in English, so that the Kru (who got cross sometimes over Siamese letters) should not fail to know who had written it: Dulayut, who was left alone, as if she were nobody's child, and had never been sent to school at all. The letter dispatched, she felt less miserable. The joy of protesting was on her, and lasted for a whole hour."	Then, as the sun began to dip and the shadows lengthened over the garden, Dulayut's spirits sank again. She wandered aimlessly through the empty rooms of the house, each corner echoing her solitude, her footsteps the only sound amidst the stillness. The large, ornate mirrors on the walls threw back her small figure, making her feel even more isolated in the vastness of the Tewadah Palace. She stopped by the window that overlooked the courtyard, watching the golden hues of sunset dance across the stone. Normally, this view would fill her with peace, but today it only deepened the ache in her heart. She felt abandoned, forgotten, like a wilted flower in a neglected garden. With a heavy sigh, Dulayut turned away from the window and decided to venture outside. The air was cooler now, the heat of the day giving way to a gentle breeze. She walked to the garden, her favorite part of the palace grounds, where the flowers seemed to understand her sadness. The frangipanis, with their soft, creamy petals, always	1911	1978.1108
"This dictum was at once fiercely attacked by the generationists who included in their party savants of European fame, the most notable being Bastian, of London. The discussion held the almost breathless attention of the newspaper reading world, and ended some years later in Pasteur's triumphant demonstration of his thesis. You can readily imagine that this research was not prosecuted by Pasteur because of its mere academic interest. He appended to his first paper, quoted above, this query — "" What could be more desirable than to push these studies far enough to prepare the road for a series of researches into the origin of various diseases?"" In 1861 Pasteur discovered the ferment of butyric acid. In the following year he discovered the ferment of acetic acid, and showed that microbes could be distinguished into two grand classes — aerobes and anaerobes."	His work was revolutionary, displacing old notions about spontaneous generation and setting the stage for modern microbiology. As Pasteur delved deeper, his focus increasingly shifted towards the practical applications of his discoveries, particularly in the realm of public health. His studies on fermentation led directly to his work on disease prevention, such as the development of vaccines. In 1865, Pasteur was called to address the problem of silkworm diseases that were devastating the silk industry in France. Through meticulous observation and experimentation, he identified the cause of the disease and recommended changes in the handling and breeding of silkworms that saved the industry. This success not only bolstered his reputation but also reinforced his belief in the germ theory of disease, which proposed that microorganisms were the cause of many diseases. Following this, Pasteur's research took him into the study of infectious diseases affecting humans. His work on anthrax and chicken cholera during the 1870s led to the development of vaccines for these diseases. By exposing the organisms to oxygen or treating them with agents that attenuated their virulence, he	1911	2005.1271

But he was an honourable old pilgrim, who without thought of his poverty had promised God that he would make the pilgrimage. He was seventy six years of age, as his beard, faded from grey - black to rich straw colour, testified; he was loving, by his soft eyes.	And his devotion was evident in the fervor with which he spoke of his journey, his faith lighting up his wrinkled face. Despite his destitution, there was a dignity about him, a resilience borne of years of faith and hardship. His gratitude for the small sum was profound, touching a chord in all who witnessed it. As the journey continued, he would often sit quietly, his lips moving in silent prayer, or he would share stories from his long life—tales of joy, sorrow, and divine encounters. Each story was imbued with the wisdom of the ages, and his audience listened, captivated by the depth of his experience and the strength of his spirit. His presence on the train became a reminder of the simpler, deeper connections in life that often go unnoticed. He spoke little of material needs or worldly frustrations, focusing instead on the spiritual sustenance that had carried him through his years. It was a lesson in perspective, a call to reflect on what truly enriches our lives. As the landscape outside the window shifted, so too did the thoughts of those around him,	1913	1913.1306
The outcome of party victory, under such influences, could result in nothing but subserviency, on the part of an officer so elected, to the interests that have elevated him to office. As a rule the conduct of his office does not rise above the selfish and sordid motives and influences that secured his  39 election. He has but little, if any, greater regard for the public welfare, as against private conflicting interests, than the machine workers to whom he is indebted for the office he holds. He is essentially the servant of the interests represented by these men, and, as a rule, protects their interests just as far as the restraints of office and the fear of public condemnation will permit, and only too often in corrupt violation of his trust as a public officer.	This state of affairs naturally fosters a system where inefficiency and corruption are not only tolerated but expected. The public, becoming cynical of such governance, gradually withdraws its trust from the institutions meant to serve them, leading to a pervasive apathy towards civic duties such as voting, further cementing the power of the machine. In such an environment, reform becomes exceedingly difficult as those in power have little incentive to change a system that benefits them personally, even at the expense of the general good. Moreover, the effects of such governance ripple outward, affecting not just the political sphere but the social and economic fabric of the community. Public resources are misallocated, innovative initiatives are stifled, and social injustices go unaddressed, all of which contribute to a stagnating society where the gap between the wealthy and the poor widens. This not only undermines the principles of democratic equality and justice but also erodes the potential for genuine progress and prosperity. Thus, it is imperative for the electorate to recognize the long-term damages of supporting such a system and to strive for greater accountability and transparency in their political	1911	1955.371

Cranberry bog newly planted, showing ditch and dike; also portion of bed not yet covered with sand. ditch four or more feet wide through the centre of the land. A smaller ditch should completely enclose the land, which should be divided into beds by lateral ditches about five rods apart. Where springs are met with they must be connected with a ditch. Importance of water. The flowage may sometimes be controlled from a pond above the bog, or by a brook or creek running through it.	The control of water levels is crucial for maintaining the optimal conditions for cranberry growth. The ability to flood the bog serves multiple purposes: it protects the plants from frost during the cold months, assists in harvesting by floating the berries for easier collection, and helps in managing pests and disease.  To effectively manage water levels, a series of gates or flumes is often installed at various points along the ditches. These can be adjusted to regulate the depth and flow of water throughout the bog, ensuring that each section receives the appropriate amount of hydration according to its specific needs.  Moreover, the quality of water is equally important. Water used for flooding should be free of any contaminants that might harm the cranberry plants. Regular testing of water sources is recommended to monitor for potential pollutants.  Properly designed and maintained drainage and irrigation systems are key to successful cranberry cultivation. This setup not only enhances the yield and quality of the crop but also ensures the sustainability of the bog ecosystem over time.	1914	1999.4442
"That is the way it came on Peter Schwarz. ""Now this is what I wish you to understand. A man will let himself become hard in his own person, as a bear will use his claws, but the inner heart of him may still be tender. When a man and his wife are one, as Peter Schwarz and I have been one these forty-seven years, in time the woman becomes — how shall I say it? She is the mildness of that man, his justice and his service. To her he leaves it to mend his mistakes. He knows she does those things that for his infirmity of spirit are hard for him, and, though he says nothing, he is glad. I do not say this is a good way or a bad way. I say it is the way of many men, and Peter Schwarz is one."	"""And so, when the harshness of the world would press too heavily upon him, it was to me he would turn, seeking the solace and comfort that his rugged nature could not summon forth on its own. In this manner, the balance between us was maintained, each supplying what the other lacked, creating a harmony that has endured the trials and tribulations of nearly half a century. Peter, with his stern demeanor and unyielding will, was often perceived as a tower of strength, unmovable and cold. Yet, within the confines of our home, within the circle of our joined lives, he allowed himself a vulnerability that the outside world would never glimpse. He entrusted me with the softness of his soul, the part that could forgive, could yield, and could nurture. This division of roles, perhaps archaic in the eyes of some, has been the bedrock of our union. It has allowed us to navigate through life’s complexities with a clear understanding of each other's intrinsic qualities. While Peter stood as the unbreakable shield, I acted as the gentle diplomat,"	1913	1904.8793
Was not that so craftily done in 1873, without a single request for it from any of all the millions of industrial xvorkers of this country, that no Congressman could be found who would say that he knew that he had voted to demonetize silver? Did a single soldier of the one million country's defenders, then living, ask for it? Is there a single case in the last forty years where our Secretary of the Treasury, who is named as one of these fortyfive directors, has been inacessible to the influence of these financiers? Are not these leading financiers the men who have grafted on to our institutions the system of issuing billions and billions of stocks, which are never to be paid, but held instead to absorb the product of honest industry? The men most interested in this latest and most dangerous plot for the enrichment of the few and the enslavement of the people have been largely connected with the great stock watering and bond inflating corporations that are annually absorbing millions of wealth that in justice belongs to industry.	Indeed, these are the same men who have engineered colossal mergers and trusts, manipulating the market to their advantage while the common laborer struggles under the weight of increased living costs without a corresponding increase in wages. They have used their influence to shape legislation that serves their interests, creating a financial environment where the rich grow richer at the expense of the working class. This manipulation of the economy is not only a betrayal of the American worker but also a destabilization of the very foundations of our economic system. The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few has led to a system where financial crises are engineered for profit, and where the average citizen is left vulnerable to the whims of those who control the capital. This is not capitalism as it was meant to be, but a perversion of it, a kind of plutocracy that undermines democracy and the general welfare of the nation. Thus, it is imperative that we call for greater transparency and regulation in financial dealings and ensure that our economic policies do not merely cater to the top echelon but promote the general prosperity of all Americans.

The only military r61e he played in England itself was the exceedingly unpleasant part of a domestic traitor who would sell, as occasion served, his King, his country, or his sister. This singular distaste which Englishmen have shown during the last three hundred years for an armed decision cuts out of the military history we are about to examine the whole development of modern artillery and of modern fortification.	It has left us, in this particular field, somewhat insular and detached from the main currents of European warfare, where the great sieges and prolonged artillery duels played pivotal roles in shaping the continent's political boundaries and alliances. As a result, England's military tactics and strategies have evolved along different lines, often focusing more on naval strength and the use of infantry in open field battles rather than on the comprehensive integration of artillery in siege warfare. This divergence has had profound effects on the military doctrines that were developed and taught in England. The emphasis has been less on the engineering skills that continental armies cultivated for constructing fortresses and breaching them, and more on mobility, logistics, and the control of sea routes. The English military tradition has thus been characterized by a certain agility and adaptability, but also by a potential vulnerability to well-equipped siege operations, a point that was underscored in various continental engagements. Moreover, the reliance on naval supremacy and the relative neglect of artillery and fortifications meant that English soil remained largely untested by the kinds of massive, drawn-out sieges that were common in	1912	1986.4933
"Miss Mahala herself had once said that if ever there was a lovable rascal it was Johnny Perry. But seasons fled in sun and shade, and Johnny was a big boy past fourteen. His voice had not changed; he could still sing ""The spacious firmament on high"" like a flute, like a young angel. But he was much pleased with a faint down upon his upper lip; it gave him a dream of the time when he should go out West and take up six hundred and forty acres  She hesitated; Reverie or Prayer, she must disturb it of land to be had for the asking. He was quite too big to be whipped; Miss Ma hala, keeping an eye upon him, felt this a pity. There were times when Johnny was playing some rogue's trick that her fingers tingled; as when he drew lurid flames with ocher and vermilion on the side of the shed that made little Pearl Asher afraid to go to bed. But it was quite a way across the woods, and Johnny was not often in evidence at Miss Mahala's. She was surprised one morning, when, coming home from a walk with Pharaoh in search of catnip, she saw her door open, and St. John Perry standing there with her Bible in his hands. ""What are you doing here, St."	"John?"" she demanded sharply, her surprise mingling with a tinge of irritation. Johnny looked up, his face a mix of mischief and innocence, a combination that only a boy of his age can perfectly render. ""I was just looking at your Bible, Miss Mahala,"" he replied, his voice smooth as he flipped through the pages. ""I heard there's a map of the Holy Land in here, and I was curious."" Miss Mahala softened slightly, her strict demeanor faltering as she watched the boy's genuine interest. ""Well, that's alright then. But you should have asked first,"" she admonished, walking over to take the heavy book from his hands. She pointed to the map spread across two of the pages. ""Here it is. See, there’s Jerusalem and the River Jordan."" Johnny leaned closer, his eyes tracing the ancient paths and cities. ""Gee, it looks a lot different than I imagined. It's all so... compact."" ""Yes, things often are,"" Miss Mahala said, a thoughtful look crossing her face as she observed him."	1913	1966.4999
In 1683 there were twelve thousand of these semi slaves in Virginia, composing about one sixth of the population, while nearly two thirds of the immigrants to Pennsylvania during the eighteenth century were white servants. Every other colony made greater or less use of them, and it is likely that more than half a million persons were of this class during the colonial period. Such a wide spread and important institution has great significance for the social and economic history of Europe and America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Moreover, the story is full of human interest because of methods used to supply the demand, similar to methods in the slave trade; the classes of people from which some servants were drawn — convicts, paupers, and dissolute persons of every type; the stormy life of many servants, and the troublesome moral and social problems which their presence engendered, such as intermarriage with negro slaves; the runaway criminal servants, and their influence on moral standards and on other phases of life in the colonies.	"The recruitment of these servants often involved deceitful practices. Agents, known as ""spirits,"" roamed the streets of London and other cities, enticing the unwary with promises of wealth and prosperity in the New World. Many were kidnapped or tricked into signing indentures, finding themselves bound to servitude for periods typically ranging from four to seven years. Once in the colonies, the reality of their situation became starkly apparent. They faced grueling work, harsh conditions, and strict oversight. Their legal status was ambiguous, and they occupied a position somewhere between free citizens and enslaved individuals. The dynamics within the servant class were complex. While some were indeed convicts or the destitute, others were skilled workers or even individuals who voluntarily indentured themselves, seeing it as the only viable way to reach the Americas. Regardless of their origins, their treatment was often uniformly harsh, and the hope of eventual freedom was a distant light. As their terms ended, some indentured servants gained their freedom and went on to play significant roles in the development of colonial society. They acquired land, started businesses,"	1913	1987.0082
"The second modification that should be mentioned is the substitution of party names for the titles, ""List 1, "" ""List 2, "" etc. Though I do not personally favour this modification, there is nothing in the system of election itself to prevent making it. If it is made, however, the simple provisions for nominating candidates covered by section 1 must be supplanted by far more elaborate provisions, such as legally regulated primaries, to guard against the giving of a party name to a list of candidates that has not a good right to it. The third modification is changing section 6 to read thus: After this first assignment of seats, the remaining seats, if any, shall be assigned to the lists showing the largest remainders of votes after the first assignment. This provision is at least as fair as the other, and simpler."	Moreover, it avoids potential confusion and ensures a more streamlined process during the allocation of seats. This approach also aligns with the broader goal of enhancing democratic representation while maintaining the integrity and simplicity of the voting system. The fourth modification, which could be considered, involves the introduction of a threshold percentage. Lists must achieve a certain percentage of the overall vote to qualify for seat allocation. This change would prevent overly fragmented parliaments and ensure that only parties with significant support are represented, thereby promoting more stable governance. Each of these modifications comes with its implications and must be carefully weighed against the principles of fairness, simplicity, and representativeness. The adoption of such modifications should ideally be preceded by comprehensive public consultation and expert analysis to gauge potential impacts and refine the proposals accordingly. The ultimate aim is to refine the electoral system in a way that upholds democratic values and meets the evolving needs of the electorate.	1914	2004.805

The Coryston Family A NOVEL BY MRS. HUMPHRY WARD CHAPTER VII IT was a breezy June afternoon, with the young summer at its freshest and lustiest. Lord and Lady Newbury were strolling in the garden at Hoddon Grey. The long, low line of the house rose behind them — an attractive house and an old one, but with no architectural features to speak of, except a high pitched, mossy roof, a picturesque series of dormer win dows, and a high gable and small lantern cupola at the farther end, which marked the private chapel. The house was evidently roomy, but built for comfort, not display. The garden, with its spreading slopes and knolls, was simple and old fashioned, in keeping thereby with the general aspect of the two people who were walking up and down the front lawn together. Lord William Newbury was a man of sixty-five, tall and slenderly built.	"His hair was white and finely groomed, lending him an air of distinguished grace, which was further accentuated by the precision of his attire. Lady Newbury, somewhat younger than her husband, walked with an elegance that matched his own, her gown rustling softly over the lush grass. Her face, though lined with the gentle tracks of time, still held the bloom and softness of a much younger woman, her eyes lively and observant beneath the brim of her wide sunhat. As they walked, they discussed the arrangements for the upcoming village fete, an annual event that drew not only the local populace but visitors from neighboring counties. Lord Newbury was particularly concerned about the placement of the stalls and the marquee, while Lady Newbury was more engaged with the guest list and the entertainment. ""William, do you think the marquee should be placed near the rose garden this year? It would provide a charming backdrop,"" Lady Newbury suggested, pausing to admire a particularly robust bush of peonies. Lord Newbury considered this for a moment, looking towards the rose garden"	1913	1944.414
"The skirts: These I can only send across by lady travellers — a thing seldom found; however, I will do my utmost to give her satisfaction on that head. "" I am sending her three pairs of embroidered cuffs, very cheap; if she wishes to have dearer ones, those with two rows of embroidery cost £2, and with three rows £4. ""As to the cotton stuff, either because M. Panckoucke has lost the sample, or because Mrs. Garrick forgot to give it him, I cannot send her any.""' Mrs. Garrick seems to have been well pleased with her cuffs, although they were so very cheap \ later she wished to give Monnet what is called "" a repeat order."" But by that time they were no longer modish: ""As to the embroidered cuffs which she asks for, tell her, please, that only the little shop women and servants wear them here; but if she would like some on fine thin muslin, they must be made specially. I await her orders on that point, and for her to tell me how many she will need."""	Moreover, Mrs. Garrick might be interested in the latest fashion we have here, which involves lace trimmings and delicate floral patterns, a style that is currently very popular among the ladies of distinction in Paris. These can be crafted to suit her taste and could serve as an excellent complement to her wardrobe, setting a tone of elegance and sophistication. As for the skirts you mentioned, I will continue to search for a reliable lady traveller who might assist us in transporting them safely and discreetly. I understand the importance of ensuring that these items reach Mrs. Garrick in impeccable condition. Regarding the cotton stuff, should Mrs. Garrick provide us with a new sample or more detailed description, I will be more than happy to match it as closely as possible. We have access to a wide variety of high-quality fabrics that could potentially meet her requirements. Please reassure her that we are committed to fulfilling her requests with the utmost attention to detail and quality. Lastly, should Mrs. Garrick desire any additional items or have other specific requests, do let me know, and I will make all necessary arrangements.	1912	1929.392
The factors which have to be taken into consideration before a scheme can be decided upon are many and varied. The CVnCmrf V/ntscif a. C GZ oturl os 3T V. FIG. 1. — Design for Indirect Liijhling Fixture, using Tungsten lamp.'. The introduction during recent years of the several new forms of illuminants, with their extremely high intrinsic brilliancy and greatly improved efficiency, has practically forced all of us concerned with the subject to scheme how best to apply the new conditions. When we remember the great number and types of new fittings and reflectors that have been brought into use within the last two years, I think it will be agreed that some very useful work has been done.	Indeed, the rapid evolution in lighting technology not only demands adaptation in terms of physical hardware but also requires a thorough understanding of the various environments where these new lighting solutions will be applied. For instance, the suitability of a certain type of bulb for indoor versus outdoor use, or for residential versus commercial settings, are critical considerations. Moreover, the aesthetic aspects cannot be overlooked. The design of lighting fixtures must complement the architectural features of the space while providing functional illumination. This dual requirement often leads to innovative designs that merge form with function, as seen in the growing popularity of minimalist and integrated lighting solutions that enhance both the utility and the visual appeal of a space. Additionally, energy efficiency and environmental impact are now paramount. With increasing awareness of sustainability issues, lighting schemes are expected to minimize energy consumption and reduce carbon footprints. This involves not only selecting energy-efficient light sources like LEDs but also designing systems that make the best use of natural light, incorporate smart technologies for better control and adaptability, and use materials and manufacturing processes that are environmentally friendly. In conclusion, the modern lighting designer must be a jack-of-all	1912	2004.267
"The ""The physico chemical cause of this ""restlessness"" which is noticeable in many insects and crustaceans is at present unknown. bees were ready to swarm out of the opening of the box used for the experiment when he suddenly removed the dark covering of the box so that the light now entered it from above. The heliotropic sensitiveness of the animals was so great that they crept upward within the box, following the direction of the light rays and were not able to make the nuptial flight. Thus, according to these observations the bees at the time of the nuptial flight are positively heliotropic machines. These observations may serve as examples of the way in which analyses of the vital phenomena of certain animals show tropisms to be elements of these phenomena."	Additionally, the responsiveness of these creatures to light suggests a deeply ingrained biological mechanism, possibly evolved to enhance survival by aligning their activities with environmental cues. In the case of bees, the heliotropic behavior not only influences their swarming and mating activities but also plays a crucial role in their foraging. Bees use the sun as a compass to navigate between their hive and food sources, which are often flowers that themselves follow the sun. This intricate dance between the physiological mechanisms of the bees and the external solar stimuli underscores the complexity of interactions within ecosystems. Further studies into the molecular and genetic bases of these tropisms might reveal specific pathways or triggers that cause such behaviors. Understanding these could provide insights into broader ecological patterns, such as how climate change could affect the temporal and spatial dynamics of pollinator activities. Moreover, this knowledge could lead to applications in agriculture and conservation, where managing the behavior of insects through light manipulation could improve pollination efficiency or control pest populations more naturally and sustainably. Thus, the study of such simple yet profound biological responses opens up a myriad of possibilities for both fundamental science	1911	2007.62
In their desperation the rebels were willing to alienate the northern counties of England to the Scotch Crown. John met that threat with all the energy of the Plantagenets. He ravaged the north as his grandmother's grand father had ravaged it. He set fire with his   own hands, in the morning, to whatever steading he had billeted himself upon the night before, and he pushed up into the border with a thoroughness that even William the Conqueror had not shown. His advanced bodies almost reached the gates of Edinburgh. They burnt Berwick, they burnt Haddington, and they burnt Dunbar. In all the north two castles alone remained in the hands of the rebellion when this cruel and terrible, but militarily most effective, task was accomplished.	The devastation wrought by John's forces was such that it left a scar upon the landscape and the people that would not soon heal. The fields were blackened, the stores of grain and livestock decimated, and many villagers found themselves without shelter or sustenance as winter approached. Yet, despite the severity of his methods, John's campaign successfully quelled the rebellion, breaking the resolve of the rebels through sheer terror and force of arms. In the wake of this harsh suppression, the northern counties lay subdued but smoldering with resentment. The scorched earth policy, while militarily effective in the short term, sowed the seeds of deep-seated animosity and distrust towards the crown. It was a pyrrhic victory that would haunt John's reign, as the northern lords, though outwardly compliant, nursed their grievances and awaited their chance for retribution. The remnants of the rebel forces, scattered and leaderless, either sought pardon and submitted to the king's mercy or fled further north, hoping to find refuge or support from the Scottish king. Meanwhile, John, confident in his victory	1912	1912.2203
"Details are, therefore, lacking ; but certain information is available, and deserves to be set forth here. Garrick appears to have reached Paris in the early days of June; on this point let us quote the Journal of Colle"", the dramatic author *: 1 Mr. Fitzgerald calls this visit "" a wedding trip . . . delayed."" Garrick had married in 1749, and had passed two summers travelling in England with his young wife. It seems to us far more probable that Garrick came to visit nis friend Monnet, who was better situated than any one else to aid him in securing dancers for his theatre; see p. 111. '"	Additionally, we learn from Colle's journal that Garrick was deeply intrigued by the Parisian theatre scene, which was markedly different from that of London. He attended performances at the Comédie-Française and was particularly taken with the French style of acting, which he found to be more expressive and less restrained than the British approach. This observation would later influence his own acting and production style, contributing significantly to his reputation for reforming English theatre. Colle notes several meetings between Garrick and prominent French actors and playwrights. These interactions were not merely social; Garrick was keen on discussing techniques and theatrical philosophies. His charisma and keen intellect made him a favorite in these circles, and he was often seen debating animatedly with his French counterparts. The purpose of Garrick’s visit extended beyond mere observation and social engagements. His theatre, the Drury Lane, was in need of fresh talent, particularly in the realm of dance and ballet, which had become increasingly popular among English audiences. Monnet, with his extensive connections in the French theatrical world, was instrumental in helping Garrick	1912	1978.046
"This was probably two years or longer before surprise at receiving it came. Going back to an earlier portion of the letter, written probably about the time of the asking for it, she says: "" I dread spring and summer. If every day were a zero blizzard, conditions would be easier to bear. When all the world is alive and stirring, it is harder to hibernate. In my corner, tied hand and foot and tongue, I am like a rat in a trap — the only thing left to do is to squeal"" — a pathetic bit of the native humour which when she was well had ever irradiated her whole life. Finally, to show how clearly appreciative she was, how inwardly responsive to even such poor desultory effort as was doled out (too often when most convenient, one fears), and especially to suggest how if a  system of recognition and care more intelligent, much more devoted had been employed, so much more good could have been done, let the conventional veil of sacred personality be removed from the very beginnings of the letter, and thus complete the picture as contained in its entirety: ""I can only thank you, "" she begins, ""for all your generous thoughts and deeds."""	"""Your kindness has been a beacon in these dreary days, a reminder that warmth still exists in the world, despite the cold that encases my own circumstances. You may not realize the extent of the comfort your words provide, nor the strength they offer to a soul so confined. Each letter you send is like a breath of spring air seeping into a sealed chamber, and I cherish them more than I can express."" ""Yet, as the seasons change and life burgeons around me, I find myself battling an ever-growing melancholy. The contrast between the vibrant life outside and my own state of stasis sharpens. It is during these times that your correspondence becomes my solace, my connection to the world that spins beyond my reach."" ""How I long for the days when I could partake in that dance of life, to feel unburdened and unrestrained. But now, I am relegated to the role of an observer, living vicariously through the narratives you share, the tales of ordinary days that seem extraordinarily precious to me."" ""Please continue to write, to share"	1911	1949.2637
"She could not stop. ""He is going to leave it to you, "" said her mind. ""He as good as said so. And it's right he should. You'Ve done for him when nobody else would, and when his own flesh and blood threw him over you took him up."" Althea was so excited that she almost felt  540 she could not sew hooks and eyes on the new poplin, lest she shouldn't space them right. It seemed to her she was made. Suppose he hadn't a great deal of money?"	"It was still enough to secure her comfort and independence, which was more than she had dared to hope for in many a year. Her hands trembled slightly as she threaded her needle, her thoughts racing ahead to what such a bequest might mean. A small cottage of her own, perhaps, or even the ability to help her sister's children with their schooling. The possibilities seemed endless, and for the first time in a long while, hope fluttered in her chest like a delicate bird. Althea's reverie was broken by the sound of Mr. Harrow's voice calling from the other room. ""Althea, could you come here for a moment?"" His tone was calm, but there was an undercurrent of urgency that she had come to recognize over the months she had cared for him. She placed her sewing carefully on the table, smoothing the fabric with a practiced hand before rising. As she made her way to his room, her mind continued to whirl with the implications of his words. What if he truly did leave her something in his will? The acknowledgment of her"	1913	1961.8448
The same point of view is reflecting itself in politics, especially in Socialism. It is the danger of Socialism. The acknowledgment of the feminine, intuitive factor in Syndicalism is the measure of the latter's value. This is what Mr. Balfour meant when he spoke of Syndicalism reflecting Bergson. The New Age, in an editorial on Mr. Balfour's speech, pits the two points of view one against the other, and on its own account claims that it represents the logical, mechanistic, with results foreseen kind of temperament: the Socialist rather than the Syndicalist: the masculine rather than the feminine. The Freewoman movement stands for both, but holds that if one must be absent, it had better be the logical, the masculinist; the feminist, the intuitive, is more vital, more fundamental, and can best save itself. In fact, the entire history of freedom means just this: it means the putting out of an advance feeler to prepare the way for the new, intuitive, life expanding impulse. Freedom is for something. It is the Scout of Life. It is the outrider which goes before the king.	This notion of freedom as a precursor to deeper, more intuitive societal changes is what drives much of the progressive thought of our times. The Freewoman movement, as it advocates for a more intuitive, less structured approach, suggests a shift from rigid systems to more fluid, responsive structures that reflect the complexity and subtlety of human experience. This shift is seen not just in political realms but permeates cultural and social spheres, advocating for a reevaluation of traditional roles and an embrace of a more holistic, interconnected view of human capabilities. As society grapples with these changes, the tension between the old and the new becomes more apparent. Traditionalists may see this as a breakdown of order, while progressives view it as a necessary evolution towards a more equitable and authentic societal structure. The challenge lies in balancing these perspectives, in finding a way to integrate the new without completely discarding the structure that the old provides. Thus, the role of movements like the Freewoman is crucial. They are not merely advocating for change; they are actively participating in the shaping of societal norms and values. They challenge	1911	2007.7616

Dae to slight gusts and other causes, stresses from two to three times the values so calculated may come on the wing spars. The spar will be taken as made of spruce cut to an i section, the web being 1 inch thick and 2 inches deep, with equal top and bottom booms 1 inch deep and If inches wide. The length of the spar will be taken at 20 feet, the end section being 2 feet long and each of the others 6 feet."	The calculation of the bending moments and stresses will be based on the assumptions that the load distribution along the spar is uniform and that the spar is simply supported at its ends. The total load acting on the spar will be assumed as 300 pounds distributed evenly along its length. This gives a load per foot of 15 pounds. First, we calculate the reaction forces at the supports (R1 and R2). Since the load is uniformly distributed and the supports are at the ends of the spar, both reactions will be equal and each will support half of the total load: \[ R1 = R2 = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ pounds} \] Next, the maximum bending moment (Mmax) occurs at the center of the spar (at 10 feet from either end). The bending moment at any point x from one end is given by: \[ M(x) = R1 \times x - \frac{w \times x^2}{2} \] where \( w = 15 \text{ pounds/foot} \) is the	1912	1981.9581
The function of the prophet is to awaken man to a realisation of the true meaning of life; to show him the eternal verities and impress their value upon his consciousness; to dethrone lawless egoism and enthrone love illumined duty in the house of life, and to reveal for man and nation the path that leadeth into the day. II. The nineteeth century was characterised by the utilitarian spirit. The age of iron, steam and electricity, of invention and unrivalled material advance, the golden age of physical science and critical investigation, was also rendered forever luminous by the number of prophets of progress who vitalized the thought of the world with messages instinct with spiritual virility. Some were preeminently awakeners, appealing to the sleeping conscience and calling men to recognise the august meaning of life, with its awful responsibilities and glorious possibilities.	These messengers, in their diverse ways, strove to reconcile the burgeoning industrial advancements with the deeper needs of the human spirit. They challenged the prevailing notions that material gain was the ultimate measure of success, urging instead a balance that considered ethical implications and the well-being of all humanity. The prophets of this era did not merely critique; they offered visions of a society where technology and progress served higher moral ends. Among these were poets and philosophers, social reformers and religious leaders, each contributing to a chorus that sought to temper the harshness of mechanization with the warmth of humanistic principles. They argued for labor rights, social justice, and a greater awareness of the interconnectedness of all life. Their teachings emphasized compassion, community, and the pursuit of truth beyond empirical evidence, pointing towards a cultivation of inner richness as the true foundation of societal advancement. As the century waned, the influence of these thinkers began to permeate various levels of society, planting seeds for future movements that would advocate for civil rights, environmental stewardship, and global peace. Their legacy was a tapestry of ideas that	1911	1995.3832
"The editor of the Star proceeds to argue that if legislation is bad it is because the people themselves have used the ballot ""wrongly or thoughtlessly"" in the selection of legislators and magistrates. The system, he affirms, is entirely adequate, if rightly used. But he had previously affirmed that the system was designedly established to prevent the development of a ""pure democracy"" — to build a rampart between the people's will and the object of their desires. Under the Constitution of 1787 the electorate is handicapped — and was designedly handicapped by men who feared ""pure democracy."" A remarkable feature of the first commission primaries at Trenton, New Jersey, on July 18th, was the inability of the campaign managers to get out the negro vote."	Despite efforts to mobilize this crucial demographic, turnout remained disappointingly low, suggesting a disconnection or disillusionment with the available political options or the process itself. This incident, while localized, speaks volumes about the broader challenges and perceptions that can influence voter engagement and participation in democratic processes.  The Star's editorial stance, while advocating for the efficacy of the current system if utilized correctly, seems to overlook the inherent barriers that might prevent it from being as effective as suggested. The constitutional framework, as the editor himself noted, establishes certain limits that were intentionally put in place to temper the direct influence of popular will. This dichotomy between the ideal of a participatory democracy and the practical limitations embedded within the political system raises important questions about the true accessibility and fairness of American democracy. How can the system be rightly used if it was designed with constraints that inherently affect its openness and responsiveness? The situation in Trenton is a microcosm of the larger tensions within American democracy—a system fraught with contradictions between its democratic ideals and the realities of its historical and structural limitations.	1911	2006.1263
The remedy lies in rescuing the country from the grip of the monopolies, and we must begin with the money monopoly. The way to do this is take away from the banks the right to issue money. The people's debts should be paid, their products exchanged and measured with public money issued for public ends. We should adopt a governmental system of currency that will expand and contract automatically with the demands of business. Mr. Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, after observing the effects of the national banks, said: My agency in procuring the passage of the National Bank act was the greatest financial mistake of my life. It has built up a monopoly that affects every interest in the country. It should be repealed. The issuing of money has ever been regarded as the highest attribute of sovereignty.	It is essential for the government to reclaim this sovereign right, thus ensuring that the control of the currency and of the general credit system is held firmly in the hands of the public, not private corporations. By doing so, we can eliminate the undue influence that private banks have on the economy, an influence that often leads to cycles of booms and busts detrimental to the general welfare of the nation. A system where the currency is tied to the real needs of the economy, rather than the profit motives of private entities, would facilitate a more stable economic environment. This would be a currency system that not only serves the interests of commerce and industry but also addresses the needs of everyday citizens. It would be a system flexible enough to provide the necessary funds for public projects and infrastructure without creating the debt that currently burdens our government and citizens. Such reforms would also help in decentralizing economic power, which has been concentrated increasingly in the hands of a few large banks. By democratizing the issuance and control of money, we can prevent the excessive accumulation of power that threatens our democratic institutions. Furthermore, the transition to	1911	1968.538
"In fact, he would be immediately discharged for that."" ""And so you think art is being stifled rather than fostered here. What should be done ? You have asked for my views, now give me yours, "" said Mme. Michaelis, as we started on our homeward walk. ""It is time to throw off our fetters, or at least to point them out to all the world, and thus help to save our budding artists from such enslavement. Why, even the drama that we have sought to uplift by building an endowed theatre, is really degraded by that very theatre."	"The problem lies not in the structures themselves, nor in the art, but in the governance and the rigid frameworks imposed upon them. Our institutions, endowed though they may be, are often strangled by conventions and old traditions that no longer serve the creative spirit of our times. They become cages rather than wings for the artist."" Mme. Michaelis nodded thoughtfully as they walked, her gaze lingering on the fading light of the day. ""So, you propose a liberation of sorts? A reformation of how we manage and fund these arts?"" ""Exactly,"" he replied with a fervor. ""We need to implement policies that allow greater artistic freedom, encourage experimentation, and foster innovation. We must establish a system where funding is not contingent upon adhering to outdated aesthetics or pleasing certain powerful patrons. Instead, support should be given to those who dare to explore, to redefine what art can be."" ""And how do we begin this monumental task?"" she asked, her voice tinged with both skepticism and hope.

Tests of the surface brightness of walls and floor showed that values ranging from 0-9-1-2 foot candles were obtained — a very satisfactory result in view of the fact that the lamps are placed so high, and the consumption of energy is only about 0-5 watts per square foot of floor area (under one third of a unit per hour). It is interesting to note how the use of artificial light, as a means of enabling games to be played in the evening, is spreading. In the case of such a game as squash rackets, played in a small space, and in a court which is preferably covered, the possibilities of extending the hours of play in this way seem very great. The recognition of the ease with which such courts can lw  LIGHTING OF A COVERED EACKET COURT. 431 FIG. 2.	FIG. 2 illustrates the method of lighting employed in a typical covered racket court. The lights are strategically placed at intervals along the ceiling, ensuring an even distribution of illumination across the entire playing area. This configuration not only minimizes shadows that could affect the visibility of the fast-moving ball but also reduces glare, which could be distracting for players. The luminaires used are specially designed for sports environments, featuring robust casings to protect against any impact from rackets or balls. Furthermore, the light fixtures are arranged in such a manner that they provide a blend of both direct and indirect lighting, which helps in reducing the contrast between illuminated areas and shadows, thus offering better visual comfort for both players and spectators. The addition of dimmable controls allows for adjustments in lighting levels, accommodating not only for different times of day but also for other events that may take place in the court, such as social gatherings or junior training sessions, which may not require the same level of brightness as competitive matches. Moreover, the use of energy-efficient LED technology in the lighting system aligns with modern sustainability practices. These LEDs	1912	2002.7799
Experiments of Ewing and Humphrey? — These included a microscopic examination of Swedish iron at intervals during the application of a sufficient number of reversals of stress to cause fracture. The observations showed that slip bands (see Art. 24) often appeared on some crystals after a comparatively small number of reversals of stress below the original yield stress, just as they do in plastic yielding. With further reversals the slip bands increase in number as well as broadening. Finally the numerous broadened slip bands developed into cracks across the crystal. These cracks quickly spread from crystal to crystal and quickly brought about fracture, probably, as mentioned above, by tearing at the edge of the crack due to a concentration of stress. The experimenters attribute the formation of cracks to the destruction of cohesion by the grinding action on the cleavage planes (see Art.	25). This action, they suggest, is facilitated by the particular orientation of the crystals relative to the direction of the applied stress. Repeated stressing in the same direction tends to align the crystal structures more uniformly, which also contributes to the eventual failure due to reduced ability to distribute the stress across a broader area of the metal structure.  The importance of these findings lies in their implications for the fatigue life of metals under cyclic loading conditions. The microstructural changes observed by Ewing and Humphrey provide a window into the processes that precede and lead to failure, offering critical insights for the design and maintenance of structures subjected to repetitive stress. Their work underscores the necessity of considering microstructural characteristics in the assessment of material durability and the prediction of service life. This understanding is crucial for industries where safety and reliability are paramount, such as in aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering.	1908	2004.8225
"a. 's necklace was stolen. Such, my friends, were the five men on whom suspicion fell."" He had hardly ceased speaking before an argument arose as to the guilty person — an argument so warm that Parker interposed. ""One moment, "" he said. ""I note that there are just twelve of you about the fire. Constitute yourselves a jury, and see if you can agree on a verdict as to which of those men took the necklace, or, if you prefer, which was most justly open to suspicion. I'M going to the writing room. You can send for me when you've decided."""	"The group around the fire looked at each other, some with a gleam of excitement, others with a skeptical arch of the brow. Nevertheless, the idea of forming a jury piqued their collective curiosity, and they began arranging themselves into a semblance of order. Mr. Thompson, the oldest among them, took the lead, clearing his throat. ""Very well, let's proceed in a civilized manner,"" he declared, adjusting his spectacles. ""We shall each state our thoughts regarding the suspects, and then proceed to a vote. If we must, we'll discuss further until we reach a consensus."" One by one, the members of the impromptu jury began to voice their opinions, each presenting their thoughts on who might have had the opportunity, motive, and means to commit the theft. Mrs. Langford suggested focusing on the alibis provided, while young Charles insisted on examining the emotional demeanor of each suspect during the days leading up to the theft. As the debate progressed, the fire crackled and the shadows danced against the walls of the cozy room, adding an eerie"	1913	1889.5294
"A small electric light bulb is fixed to the head of the machine just above the needle attachment ; this bulb is blackened on the upper side, so that the light only falls on the needle itself and on the part of the material through which it is to pass, leaving the operator's eyes in the shadow. There is a separate switch for each light, under the control of the worker. The method appears to give satisfaction, as I found every light in use at the time of my visit."" These are the chief points dealt with in the General Report. We will now proceed to give an abstract of Mr. D. R. Wilson's special report. SPECIAL REPORT ON FACTORY LIGHTING. (In dealing with this report we are obliged to abbreviate many portion!, and those rieBiiing fuller details « e referred to the official version; special interest, attaches to the complete series of measurements of illumination tabulated in the Appendix.)"	Mr. D. R. Wilson's report begins by emphasizing the critical importance of proper lighting in factory environments, not only for the efficiency of work but also for the health and safety of the workers. He notes that inadequate lighting can lead to increased errors, reduced output, and higher incidences of workplace accidents. The report then delves into the specifics of optimal lighting setups, advocating for a combination of natural and artificial light sources to ensure a well-lit working space throughout the day. The report discusses various types of lighting fixtures and their placements, recommending overhead lighting for general illumination and task lighting for specific workstations. Wilson stresses the importance of avoiding glare and shadows that could obscure a worker's vision or cause eye strain. He suggests using diffused light sources and positioning lights at strategic angles to minimize these risks. A significant portion of the report is dedicated to the analysis of light intensity. Wilson presents data from a series of experiments conducted in different factory settings. These experiments measured the lux levels (a unit of illumination) at various workstations and compared them to recommended standards. The findings indicate that many factories	1912	2006.7023
The rites of the cross in liturgy, the use and significance of the sign of the cross, the vast body of legends of the miracle of the cross, the hymns, the theological literature of the cross — all were transferred from the church of Rome to the church of the Anglo-Saxons. While in these ideas and practises we find no strikingly original elements, they are significant in that they took such deep root in English soil, and overshadowed all classes of society. Even to the semipagan, to whom the literature of the Fathers meant nothing, and the ritual in the church little more, the cross was a potent talisman to add to his ancient heathen formulas, and he accepted and trusted it as a ' victory token.' 1Blickl. Horn., p. 96.	The cross, thus integrated into the fabric of Anglo-Saxon spirituality, transcended mere religious symbolism. It became a cultural touchstone, a point of convergence where old and new beliefs intermingled. This adaptation was facilitated by the missionaries who, understanding the importance of cultural sensitivity, often incorporated elements of the existing pagan traditions into their Christian teachings. They presented the cross not only as a symbol of Christ's sacrifice but also as a powerful emblem capable of protection and blessing, akin to the amulets and charms of old. In the art and poetry of the period, the cross is frequently depicted and celebrated, not just as a theological symbol but as a part of the very landscape of Anglo-Saxon life. The Dream of the Rood, one of the most famous Old English poems, exemplifies this integration. The poem personifies the cross, giving it voice to recount the story of the Crucifixion from its perspective. This anthropomorphic portrayal reflects the deep emotional and spiritual resonance the symbol held. Moreover, the veneration of the cross during this period was not limited to the ecclesiast	1904	2006.1718
At the same time, he did not see why gas or incandescent electric lamps should not be used, even in conjunction with arc lights, for this purpose if the other rays were filtered to get the proper proportion of the blue rays, so as to represent daylight. MR. V. H. MACKINNBY expressed his interest in the paper. There was a large section of the general public which considered expense of secondary importance provided good colour dis crimination was secured. In his work he had frequently been interested in these colour problems, one point being the effect on the colour of a source of using tinted shades. It was often essential to use a form of reflector which did not alter the spectrum of the light in any way. In this connexion Mr. Mackinney demonstrated that a piece of Holophane glass did not affect the colour of light in transmission by holding it in the rays from a lantern.	He further elaborated on the importance of maintaining the integrity of the light spectrum especially in settings where precision in color perception is crucial, such as in art galleries and textile industries. Mr. Mackinney pointed out that the use of certain materials in lamp shades could significantly distort color perception by altering the spectral output of the light source. This could lead to erroneous color judgment, which might be detrimental in fields requiring accurate color matching. He also discussed the advancements in light-filtering technology, emphasizing that modern filters could be designed to selectively absorb or reflect specific wavelengths, thereby enabling the creation of lighting environments that closely mimic natural daylight conditions. This is particularly beneficial in design and manufacturing processes where color fidelity is paramount. Furthermore, Mr. Mackinney touched upon the psychological effects of lighting on human perception and mood. He noted that the quality of light not only affects how we see colors but also influences our circadian rhythms and overall well-being.  Concluding his remarks, Mr. Mackinney encouraged the audience to consider not only the functional aspects of lighting but also the aesthetic and health implications. He advocated for	1912	2006.5887
"Wait a bit! I think some of your judgments may be too hasty, Lord Corys tonne. There's a deal to learn in this neighbourhood — the Iloddon Grey estate, for instance."" Coryston threw up his hands. "" The Newburys — my word, the New burys! ' Too bright and good ' — aren't they? — 'for human nature's daily food.' Such churches — and schools — and villages! All the little boys patterns — and all the little girls saints. Everybody singing in choirs — and belonging to confraternities — and carrying banners. ' By the pricking of my thumbs, ' when I see a Newbury I feel that a mere fraction divides me from the criminal class. And I tell you, I'Ve heard a story about that estate — "" the odd figure paused beside the tea table, and rapped it vigorously for emphasis — "" that's worse than any other villainy I'Ve yet come across."	"""It's all very well to have a picturesque estate and a model village,"" Coryston continued, his voice growing more heated as he spoke, ""but behind the scenes, it's a different story. There's a tenant there—old Robbins. Been on the estate since he was a boy. Now, what do you think? They're evicting him—throwing him out after forty years—because he dared to speak his mind about the Newburys' management of the estate at the last parish meeting. Said the rents were too high and the houses were falling to bits. And for that, they're turning him out!"" Lord Corystonne's companion, a more moderate man, tried to interject, ""But surely, Coryston, there must be some mistake. The Newburys have always been known for their—"" ""No mistake about it!"" Coryston cut him off sharply. ""I've seen the notice myself. And it's not just Robbins. Anyone who doesn't toe the line, who doesn't fit into their perfect little picture, is out"	1913	1978.3674
Practically, however, this would be of little difference; the leather made from the hides of animals dead of old age would be of so low value as to be almost worthless; and the use of the hides of animals dead of disease, many forms of which are infectious and communicable to man, would be fraught with danger and difficult of execution. Mankind would have to face the problem of clothing without the aid of leather and fur. Can the surface of the earth (for the fish of the sea would have to be excluded) raise enough grain, fruits, nuts and vegetables, added to dairy products, to meet the albumin needs of the present earth's population? Unhesitatingly it may be stated that the area of the earth's surface now under cultivation could not, with the present methods of agriculture, dependably produce enough plant albumin to meet the needs of the present population. Very large areas of the earth's surface at present produce only grasses, shrubs and trees.	These areas, while supporting diverse forms of wildlife and livestock, are not currently utilized for intensive crop production due to limitations such as soil quality, climate, and topography. To address the potential shortfall in plant-based albumin, significant advancements in agricultural technology and changes in land use would be required. This could include the development of new crop varieties that are capable of thriving in less-than-ideal conditions, improvements in soil fertility management, and innovative farming techniques such as vertical farming and hydroponics. Moreover, a shift towards more sustainable agricultural practices would be essential to ensure that increased plant production does not come at the expense of environmental health. This would involve reducing reliance on chemical pesticides and fertilizers, implementing crop rotation and other soil health enhancing practices, and careful water management. The transition to a diet devoid of animal products would also necessitate changes in dietary patterns worldwide. Education and cultural adaptation would play crucial roles in facilitating this shift, helping individuals and communities to embrace plant-based diets that are not only nutritious but also palatable. In conclusion, while the challenge is formidable, with coordinated global effort and technological	1911	2006.842
A. I. B. 999 THE POPULATION QUESTION. To the Editor of THE FREEWOMAN. MADAM, — Mr. Collins may perhaps appear to have convicted me of some inconsistency in the two passages he has quoted from my letter. I believe, however, that both tendencies to which I have referred exist — that any improvement in the condition of the lower classes in itself tends to increase reproduction (and, therefore, to do away with the benefit of these improvements), but that the increased knowledge and foresight, which improved conditions are today likely to bring in their train, will probably ultimately bring about a restriction of reproduction.	This duality, I contend, is not contradictory but complementary. It constitutes the very crux of the population question as it stands today. On the one hand, better health, nutrition, and living conditions generally encourage a higher birth rate; on the other, the very improvements that elevate these conditions also foster greater education and awareness, which in turn may lead to a more deliberate and restrained approach to family size. It is my belief that the latter tendency will, in time, prevail, as it is supported by the increasing value placed on individual autonomy and economic prudence in modern societies. Moreover, as societies evolve, the pressures of maintaining a sustainable lifestyle amidst finite resources will necessitate a more measured approach to reproduction. The challenge, therefore, lies not in choosing between these two tendencies, but in nurturing the balance where improved living conditions go hand-in-hand with responsible family planning. It is a delicate equilibrium, requiring not only continued improvement in the economic and health sectors but also robust educational campaigns that underscore the importance of sustainable family practices. Thus, the progression towards a more educated and foresighted populace should be	1911	1954.5114
By comparison, the first case is as easy to handle as the second is difficult. Restriction of surface and near surface visibility, as in radiation fog, is the essential hazard to air and seacraft operation involved in advection fog. Icing of some magnitude occurs in upslope fog, but altitudes at which aircraft operate over foggy regions are normally above what is normally considered the fog level. The icing really occurs in orographical clouds.	In the case of advection fog, which typically forms when moist air moves over cooler surfaces, such as water or land, the resulting visibility impairment can extend over large areas and persist for prolonged periods. This type of fog is particularly challenging for navigation because it tends to be more extensive and less predictable than radiation fog, which forms under clear skies and calm conditions. The latter usually dissipates with the morning sun, whereas advection fog can linger and shift with prevailing winds, complicating both maritime and aviation operations. Furthermore, the operational difficulties in advection fog are exacerbated by its tendency to form layers of varying density. Pilots may encounter sudden changes in visibility, making it difficult to anticipate and react appropriately. This unpredictability requires heightened vigilance and reliance on instrumentation, which can be taxing and increase the risk of human error. Moreover, the broader geographic spread and the persistence of advection fog can disrupt schedules and routes, leading to significant logistical challenges and economic impacts. Ports may experience delays, and flights may need to be rerouted or cancelled, affecting not only the carriers but also the overall flow of	1913	2004.3202

At the same time it is only right to say that the matter has been got together somewhat hastily, owing to the urgent requests of some members of the Society for an immediate issue of the pamphlet. No doubt there will subsequently be opportunities of making such improvements as may appear desirable. For the moment the illustrations used are examples of electric lighting. But the text applies equally well to all illuminants, and we hope before long to reissue this publication, in which the text will be substantially the same, but the illustrations will deal with gas lighting. We should like to mention that it has naturally been necessary to make the contents of this primer very general. There are many problems which are peculiar to one branch of lighting, such as are involved, for example, in the lighting of shops, schools, streets, factories, c., which cannot be included in its scope.	Nevertheless, the principles laid out herein should provide a foundational understanding that can be adapted and applied to those more specific contexts as needed. The aim is to offer a broad perspective that encompasses the key aspects of efficient and effective illumination, regardless of the medium utilized. In the future, we plan to expand this work to include more detailed discussions tailored to the unique requirements of different environments and applications. This would potentially involve a series of supplementary guides or an expanded edition of this pamphlet, which would delve into the intricacies of lighting design and implementation across various settings. We appreciate the understanding of our readers and their patience as we continue to refine and enhance our materials. We also encourage feedback and suggestions, which are invaluable as we strive to meet the needs of our diverse audience and improve the utility of our publications. As always, our goal is to disseminate knowledge that is both practical and scientifically sound, aiding all those interested in the art and science of lighting.	1912	2006.8663

The experiments led to the devising of a practical  22 workshop test for the rapid estimation of the relative amount of impurity present in castor oil. Light alloys. — A preliminary Report by Dr. Rosenhain on light alloys was included in the Report of the Committee for the year 1909-10. Since that date a large amount of work on light alloys has been carried out at the National Physical Laboratory, partly for this Committee, especially in the way of examination of special alloys submitted by the Constructive Departments, and partly for the Alloys Research Committee of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.	The investigations have included tests on the physical properties of various aluminum and magnesium alloys, focusing particularly on their strength, ductility, and resistance to corrosion. Noteworthy among these studies has been the development of an alloy known as Duralumin, which offers considerable advantages in terms of weight reduction and strength for aviation and automotive applications. The testing procedures have been standardized to ensure consistency and reliability across all experiments. This includes the use of modern equipment for tensile, compression, and fatigue testing, as well as advanced metallurgical analyses to determine the microstructure and phase composition of the alloys. Furthermore, the research has extended to the study of the effects of heat treatment on the properties of these light alloys. Various heat treatment processes, such as quenching, annealing, and aging, have been examined to optimize the mechanical properties and enhance the performance of the alloys under different operational conditions. This comprehensive approach has not only contributed to a better understanding of light alloys but also facilitated the development of new applications and improvements in existing technologies. The collaboration with industrial partners has been crucial in translating these research findings into practical solutions	1912	1992.7394

Certainly the outburst of the members of the W.S.P.U."	has been passionate and perhaps at times uncontrolled, but it is the fire of those who have been long suppressed and now seek to assert not only their individual rights but the rights of all women. We must remember the context in which these actions and emotions arise. The struggle is not merely for the vote, but for a new recognition of woman's position in society, a breaking away from the shackles that have historically bound our ambitions and our capabilities. To be brave, to be selfish in the pursuit of what is just and right—these are qualities we must nurture. Christabel Pankhurst has been a beacon for many, not because she is infallible, but because she dares to demand loudly and without apology the rights that are due. In her, many women see the crystallization of their frustrations and their hopes. It is not merely a political campaign; it is a personal battle for self-definition and respect. It is easy to criticize from a distance, to dissect actions and words with the scalpel of hindsight. But we must not forget the courage it takes to stand up in	1911	1964.3046
I notice in the case of the room in which Mr. Ritchie made his experiments that three of the four walls were lined with green backed files. These would modify to some extent the colour of the light that fell upon the specimens of ribbon. Perhaps Mr. Ritchie can tell us to what extent the green surfaces would alter the results. It is, of course, conceivable that the modifying effect of coloured walls might correct the colour yielded by an incorrect source. A practical difficulty is that of defining standard daylight. With the great variation in the colour and density of the atmosphere, and the variety of reflecting surfaces that abound, a daylight standard is, I fear, unlikely to prove of great value to us.	Indeed, the complexity of defining such a standard arises from the inherent variability of natural light itself. Daylight can differ significantly not only from one geographic location to another but also from hour to hour as weather conditions change. The angle of the sun, the presence of clouds, and even the reflection and absorption properties of nearby objects can all influence the quality of light. Moreover, in a controlled experimental setting like Mr. Ritchie's, the presence of green-backed files might introduce a tinting effect, skewing the perceived colors of the ribbon specimens. This greenish hue, depending on its intensity and saturation, could potentially either dampen or exaggerate certain wavelengths of light, leading to a misrepresentation of the ribbon colors under what might be considered 'neutral' daylight conditions. Addressing this issue might involve using neutral gray surroundings to minimize color interference, or employing artificial lighting that mimics the spectrum of natural daylight as closely as possible. Advanced colorimetric tools could also be used to measure and adjust the light properties to ensure consistency and reliability in the experimental outcomes.	1912	2004.7291
"Enlarge the horizon of the peoples. Liberate their conscience from the materialism by which it is weighed down. Set a vast mission before them."" Bolton King, in his fine work on Mazzini, epitomises his concept in regard to duty and the ideal: ""On this religious foundation Mazzini constructed his code of ethics — Christian, very Christian in its spirit, essentially modern in its application; the noblest morality that has sought to answer to the needs of a democratic society."	He saw in every man a child of God, endowed with a divine mission to fulfill on earth. His teaching emphasized the sanctity of that mission, urging men to recognize their own worth and the importance of their contributions to the collective human endeavor. Duty, to Mazzini, was not a burden but a privilege, the expression of one's highest potential and the means by which one participates in the universal progression towards a higher ethical and spiritual state. His ethics revolved around the concept of 'Duties' rather than 'Rights', a perspective that shifted focus from individual entitlement to collective responsibility. 'Love and aspire', he would say, encapsulating in these words the dual motion of affection towards one's fellow beings and the striving for a higher, common good. This was the essence of his democratic society, where each individual's aspirations contribute to the upliftment of all, creating a harmonious and progressive community. Mazzini's vision was not limited to mere political reform, but encompassed a complete moral regeneration of society. He advocated for education that nurtured the soul as well as the	1911	1995.0178
Having determined c and b, it is easy to predict roughly from this rational formula the elongation of another piece of the same material, but of other dimensions. This gives a method of effecting an approximate comparison of ductilities as measured by ultimate elongation in tests made on pieces of widely different proportions. This point may be best illustrated by an example.	Suppose we have a steel rod with a length of 50 cm and a diameter of 2 cm, and in a tensile test, it elongates by 2.5 cm before breaking. We calculate the elongation percentage as \( \frac{2.5}{50} \times 100 = 5\% \). Now, if we have another steel rod of the same material but with a length of 100 cm and a diameter of 4 cm, we can use our previous data to estimate its elongation under similar conditions.  Assuming that the material properties remain consistent, and the elongation is primarily a function of the material rather than the dimensions, we might expect a similar elongation percentage. Thus, for a 100 cm rod, an elongation of 5% would correspond to 5 cm. However, because the second rod is thicker, it might actually exhibit slightly different behavior due to volume and weight differences affecting the material's internal stress distribution.  This method isn't perfect, as it simplifies the impact of changes in geometry and scale,	1908	1976.6561

Vermillion, the court held that municipal authorities are endowed with certain discretionary powers in the regulation and maintenance of public works, which are not subject to judicial interference unless exercised in a manner demonstrably oppressive or unreasonable. This principle underscores the broader doctrine of municipal autonomy within prescribed legal limits, reflecting a deferential approach by the judiciary toward decisions made by elected local government officials. Further examination of Tife v. Blake reveals a nuanced interpretation of property rights under state law. The court in this instance delineated the boundaries of private versus public interest, emphasizing the necessity for a clear demarcation when municipal actions potentially encroach upon individual property rights. The decision was pivotal in defining the scope of eminent domain and its application, particularly in the context of urban development and the public's interest in securing land for community projects. These cases, among others cited within the volume, illustrate the evolving landscape of American jurisprudence in the areas of municipal law and property rights during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They provide valuable insights into the legal principles that govern	1913	1976.9122
In this method a trellis with two wires is commonly used and these are respectively ZAND 5% feet from the ground. It is especially important to have the end posts set solid in the ground and well braced. The intermediate posts are generally driven and they usually stand about twenty feet apart, which allows for a post between every other vine, if they are set ten feet apart the common distance between them. Vine yardists often grow their vines two years on stakes before putting up the trellis when following this method. four cane Kniffen system. In this method a single cane is carried up the trellis to the top wire and two canes are trained outward from side spurs at each wire. The vine has then four horizontal canes tied to two wires.	This system is advantageous as it allows for a balanced distribution of the vine's growth and promotes adequate sunlight penetration and air circulation. Each of the four canes is pruned to have a similar number of buds, ensuring an even crop load and reducing the risk of overburdening the vine. Proper training and pruning are crucial in this system to maintain the structure and health of the vine.  The lower canes, closer to the ground, tend to be more vigorous due to their proximity to the roots and soil nutrients. It is essential to monitor their growth carefully to prevent them from becoming dominant. The upper canes, while generally less vigorous, receive more light and are crucial for the balanced development of the vine.  Annual pruning is necessary to remove old wood and to shape the vine for the upcoming season. This involves selecting healthy, well-placed canes from the previous year’s growth to become the new fruiting canes. The chosen canes should be free of disease and damage, and properly spaced to allow for light penetration and air flow. The four cane Kniffen system is	1914	2003.925

It would require nine and a half globes the size of Mars to make one globe the size of the earth; and even then it would not be so heavy, because the average density of Mars is only about three fourths of that of the earth. Mars is the next planet outside the earth's orbit, so is the fourth from the sun. The orbit in which Mars moves in its journey round the sun is very much more eccentric than the earth's orbit; in fact it is more eccentric than the orbits of any of the larger planets. As a consequence, the planet's distance from the sun varies greatly according to the particular part of the orbit in which it may be moving. Its mean distance from the sun is 141,500,000 miles, its greatest distance over 154,000,000, and at its nearest approach to the sun, or ' perihelion, ' as it is called, its distance is only 129,500,000 miles.	This variance in distance not only affects the amount of solar energy Mars receives but also plays a significant role in the seasonal changes experienced on the planet. Mars has a tilt in its axis similar to that of Earth, which results in the presence of seasons. However, the eccentricity of its orbit means that these seasons are not of equal length. The southern hemisphere experiences a short, intense summer and a long, cold winter due to the planet being closer to the sun during the southern summer and farther during its winter. The surface of Mars presents a landscape marked by vast deserts, towering volcanoes, and deep canyons. Among the most striking features is Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system, standing at about 13.6 miles high, nearly three times the height of Mount Everest. The Valles Marineris system of canyons, adjacent to the Tharsis region, stretches over 2,500 miles and dives as deep as 7 miles below the surrounding surface, showcasing the dynamic geological processes of Mars.

Another instant and he could have turned and died; it wanted no more than an instant of freedom, of detachment from the tensity of the situation ; but that instant was not to be had. Under the compulsion of the revolver he climbed the gate and waited in the middle of the road with his back turned while his captor climbed it after him.

Six o'clock passed and the attack was not delivered. The Royalists did not believe it would be delivered that day. Rupert upon the left wing dismounted (as did some of his 'officers), and called for supper. Immediately, though the sun was already near setting, the right wing of the Parliamentary Army cavalry, which Oliver Cromwell commanded, charged. The various fortunes of the two lines, the defeat of Rupert's horse, the converse defeat of the Scotch and most of the Parliamentary infantry, the re covery of the situation by Cromwell's return from pursuing Rupert and his charging of the successful Royalist Infantry in flank, made up the three tactical phases of the battle.	As night fell, the field was a tumult of confusion and clamor. The Royalists, who had been heartened by their initial success, found themselves suddenly outmaneuvered by Cromwell's strategic genius. His cavalry, though weary from the chase, reformed with remarkable speed and precision, striking fear into the hearts of their adversaries. The Royalist infantry, now exposed on their flank and harried by fresh troops, began to falter.  Cromwell, observing the shift in momentum, pressed his advantage. He sent messengers darting through the ranks, rallying his foot soldiers to renew their efforts. With trumpets blaring and drums beating a furious rhythm, the Parliamentary forces launched a renewed assault. This time, they struck not only with the ferocity of arms but with a renewed spirit that seemed to swell from the earth itself. The Royalists, their lines now crumbling under the relentless pressure, were forced into a ragged retreat.

Figure 6, taken on a day of moderate winds, shows a smooth curve with few sharp peaks, indicating a steady breeze with minimal gusting. This type of wind is ideal for outdoor activities that require less wind interference, such as archery or drone flying. Figure 7, on the other hand, presents a different scenario. Captured on a day marked by a weather front passage, the chart is characterized by sudden, sharp spikes interspersed with periods of relative calm. These spikes represent strong gusts that can be challenging for structures and activities vulnerable to wind, such as construction work on high-rise buildings or sailing. Figure 8 illustrates a day with variable wind conditions, displaying a series of moderate peaks and troughs. This suggests a fluctuating wind that can change direction and intensity quickly. Such conditions are typical of days when local thermal effects, such as land heating faster than water, influence the wind patterns.

The old man and one old woman in the tribe were the only two who did not accept Christianity. The old man's son, Ilavinirk said, was in a great quandary, because he was fond of his father, but did not dare to disobey the missionary's injunctions. He had found a sort of middle course by compelling the old man to keep his own house and to eat by himself. Some of the things concerning which the Eskimos have received new ideas from the missionaries are of a somewhat fundamental nature; other things which Ilavinirk believed the missionaries to have taught his people are rather immaterial and make little difference one way or the other. He told me one day that he had often wondered why it was that the mammoth are all extinct.	He believed that the missionaries might have an explanation, as they seemed to know so much about the world beyond their icy shores. According to his understanding, these ancient creatures were not just animals but were part of a greater story that tied into the teachings of the missionaries. The old man, however, held his own beliefs. He spoke of legends passed down through generations, where mammoths were creatures of the earth's creation era, living symbols of the land's immense power and mystery. The old woman, on the other hand, was more reticent about the influence of these new teachings. She held firm to the old ways, the rituals and the dances that connected them to the land and the spirits of their ancestors. To her, the extinction of the mammoths was a natural cycle of life, a testament to the changing world which did not require the explanation of foreign beliefs. This divergence in acceptance of new ideas versus old beliefs created a subtle rift within the community, a microcosm of the larger cultural shifts happening as a result of external influences.

Since these rules only contemplate very long struts, it is to be expected that they would not give very accurate values of the collapsing load until lengths considerably greater than those abovementioned have been reached. For shorter struts than these Euler's rules are not applicable, and will, if used, evidently give much too high a value of the collapsing load ; such shorter or medium length struts are, however, of very common occurrence in structures and machines. The values of for columns of mild steel and cast iron with freely hinged ends, as calculated by (7), Art. 100, are shown in Fig. 148. 102.	The Rankine formula, which takes into account both the direct stress due to axial load and the bending stress due to the slenderness of the column, provides a more applicable approach for determining the load capacity of these medium-length columns. According to Rankine's theory, the critical load at which a column will buckle can be given by: \[ P = \frac{{\pi^2 EI}}{{(KL)^2}} \] where \( P \) is the critical load, \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity, \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the cross-section, \( K \) is the column effective length factor, and \( L \) is the actual length of the column. The factor \( K \) depends on the conditions of end support of the column: for both ends pinned \( K \) is 1.0, for one end fixed and the other free \( K \) is 2.0, and for both ends fixed \( K \) is 0.5.

She waited patiently while the man slowly and as we thought faithlessly urged the nude to the parapet; then, when she put out her hands and leaned forward to take her seat, the mule inched softly away and left her to recover her balance at the risk of a fall on the other side. We were too far for anything but the dumb show, but there were, no doubt, words which conveyed her opinions unmistakably to both man and mule. With our hearts in our mouths we witnessed the scene and its repetitions till we could bear it no longer, and we had bidden our cabman drive on when with a sudden spring the brave woman launched herself semieircularly forward and descended upon the exact spot which she had been aiming at. There solidly established on the mule, with her arms fast round the man, she rode off; and I do not think any reader of mine would like to have been that mule or that man for the rest of the way home.	The scene was both comical and nerve-wracking, a true test of patience and daring. The mule, perhaps sensing the determination in the woman's posture, finally submitted to its fate as a bearer for the journey ahead. As they trotted away, we watched her figure, now triumphantly perched atop the mule, her resolve having conquered both beast and handler.  The man, looking somewhat embarrassed and resigned, walked beside them, his role reduced to that of a mere escort to the indomitable lady he had tried to subdue. It was clear that this woman was not one to be trifled with, her spirit as sturdy as the mountains that loomed around us.  Our laughter, mingled with relief, followed them down the path until they turned a bend and were lost to sight. The image of her victorious mounting, arms tightly clasped around the man for balance, remained etched in our minds as a symbol of unexpected heroism in the face of obstinate adversity.	1913	1968.6364

"" Professor Lowell has devoted some sixteen years to close and continuous observation of Mars whenever it has been in a position to be observed, and many thousands of drawings have been made, the results being plotted down on a globe."	These extensive efforts have culminated in a series of maps that show intricate details of the Martian surface, including what appear to be canal-like structures. Lowell's observations and recordings have sparked significant debate amongst the astronomical community, with many questioning the reliability and interpretations of these features. However, Lowell staunchly defends his findings, attributing the visibility of these structures to the superior atmospheric conditions when Mars is at opposition and closest to Earth, thus providing clearer and more detailed views. His hypothesis suggests that these canals are the work of an intelligent civilization, engineered to distribute water from the polar ice caps to arid equatorial regions of the planet. This idea, while controversial, has stirred the imagination of the public and scientific community alike, leading to further studies and observations by other astronomers. Critics argue that the so-called canals might merely be optical illusions or misinterpretations of natural surface features, exacerbated perhaps by the psychological effects of prolonged observation and expectation. The debate continues as technology advances and more powerful telescopes and imaging techniques become available, allowing for more detailed and less ambiguous observations of the Martian landscape.	1911	1999.5298
"Then, in truth, will Christianity become socialised, and Socialism become Christianized. LITTLE LESSONS IN DIRECT LEGISLATION By George M. Hammell IV. THE Hon. Elihu Root, whose early career was distinguished by service as attorney for ""Boss"" Tweed, has developed a profound reverence for the ""Constitution"" and, especially for the ""Senate of the United States."" He deprecates ""tampering"" with the fundamental law and deplores election of Senators by direct vote of the electorate. In an article, published in The Independent, March, 1911, he says: ""The Senate was established by the Constitution to protect the American democracy against itself."""	He argues that the framers of the Constitution, being men of great foresight and understanding of human nature, designed the Senate to act as a safeguard; a buffer between the potentially impulsive decisions of the masses and the execution of laws. According to Root, this chamber was to be composed of individuals selected for their wisdom and experience, capable of deliberating with the necessary detachment and prudence that direct popular election might jeopardize. Root's stance is that the indirect election of Senators ensures a level of deliberation and stability in governance, preventing the caprices of popular sentiment from dictating national policy too directly. He fears that direct elections would lead to a Senate too closely tied to the fleeting whims of the electorate, potentially leading to instability and rash legislation. This perspective, while controversial to proponents of more direct democratic processes, underscores a fundamental debate in democratic governance: the balance between direct democratic involvement and mediated decision-making. Root's reverence for the Constitution and the structures it establishes is rooted in a belief in the wisdom of the Founding Fathers and their understanding of the complexities of governance.

By Professor A. B. WOLFE ORERLIN COLLEGE FEW aspects of present educational thought are more striking than the persistent and telling criticism it is bringing to bear on the American College. The universal demand for efficiency in our national life has put the college on trial — and has caught it in a state of unpreparedness to make a consistent defence in its own behalf.	The charge is clear: our colleges are accused of being too detached from the realities of the world, too cloistered in their approach, too theoretical without sufficient application. They are said to produce graduates who are well-versed in abstract knowledge but less equipped to tackle the practical demands of modern society. In response, many are advocating for a reformation of the collegiate system. They suggest a curriculum that is more integrated with practical experiences, one that includes internships, real-world problem solving, and collaboration with industries. This, they argue, would not only enhance the relevance of a college education but also increase its value in the eyes of both students and prospective employers. Yet, what truly makes a college are not just the subjects taught or the methods of teaching. It is the spirit of inquiry, the fostering of a community of learners, the commitment to intellectual rigor, and the cultivation of both critical and creative thinking. A college should be a place where young minds are not only informed but also transformed, where the values of integrity, curiosity, and resilience are instilled. Thus, the challenge lies not	1911	2002.6224

The troops at Danbury must be withdrawn, or they would be isolated. This difficult manoeuvre was executed by way of West Hanningfield. The rest of the Vth Corps conformed to the movement, the Guards Brigade at East Hanningfield forming the rearguard, and fighting fiercely all night through with the Saxon troops, who moved out on the left flank of our retreat.	As dawn broke, the situation grew increasingly dire. The Saxons, relentless in their pursuit, had managed to cut off several smaller units of the rearguard, capturing equipment and taking prisoners. The main body of the Vth Corps, however, continued to retreat in an orderly fashion, thanks to the disciplined rear-guard action provided by the Guards Brigade. Their sacrifice ensured that the bulk of the troops could reach the relative safety of the defensive lines being hastily prepared around Chelmsford. The terrain, a mixture of dense woodlands and open fields, played to the advantage of the retreating British forces. The thickets provided cover, slowing the German advance and allowing British forces to set up ambushes that momentarily halted the enemy's progress. Artillery units, positioned on the higher ground near Chelmsford, began to pound the advancing German columns, causing further delays and disarray. Meanwhile, at the strategic command post in Chelmsford, senior officers were in a flurry of activity, coordinating with other Corps and divisions to form a cohesive defensive line. Telegrams were sent, and	1906	1969.0349
"1 The Champion, No. 466 ; quoted in The Qentleman't Magatine, October 1743. Garrick relied so much on his facial resources that, according to Murphy, he abandoned the r61e of Othello because he could not employ them properly in that part, the black make-up preventing the audience from following the workings of his countenance. His eyes were extremely striking, full of fire and movement. """	Indeed, it was often said that Garrick could convey a whole spectrum of emotions with a single glance. His ability to manipulate his facial expressions was unparalleled, and he used this skill to great effect on the stage, captivating audiences and drawing them deep into the drama unfolding before them. His mastery over his expressions was such that even the subtlest twitch or the slightest arch of an eyebrow could speak volumes, adding layers of complexity to his characters. However, the role of Othello presented unique challenges. The necessity of darkening his skin to play the Moor of Venice obscured these nuanced expressions that were so integral to his performances. The heavy makeup required for the role did not allow his natural complexion to show through, thus muting the effectiveness of his facial expressions. This limitation was a significant factor in his decision to step away from the character, despite the prominence and dramatic potential of the role. Garrick's contemporaries and critics often lamented this decision, for his interpretation of Othello's passionate and tumultuous spirit was eagerly anticipated. Yet, those who understood Garrick's reliance on his	1912	1994.5084
The child must bear the injustice silently. A hasty, angry word or an unfriendly expression of mistrust on the part of the teacher, which may have pierced into the mind and settled there, may inhibit the normal mental life for years to come, even though the child no longer remembers the particular offence. The responsibility of the teacher grows in these directions the more, the better we understand the mechanism of the mind. There are several remedies possible. Ordinarily, of course, the mere passing of time is the simplest. The motor setting slowly loses its strength and new attitudes may develop. But too many brains do not show this improvement; the disturbance becomes more and more aggravated.	Thus, more proactive measures are necessary. One effective approach is open communication, where the teacher engages the child in a discussion about the incident. This dialogue allows the child to express their feelings and thoughts, and the teacher to provide clarification, apologize if necessary, and restore the child's trust.  Another remedy involves fostering a supportive classroom environment that promotes resilience and emotional intelligence. By teaching children how to manage their emotions and cope with adversity, they are less likely to be detrimentally impacted by negative experiences. Teachers can implement strategies such as mindfulness exercises, emotional literacy lessons, and peer support systems to build a stronger, more empathetic community within the classroom. Moreover, teacher training programs must emphasize the importance of emotional awareness and sensitivity. Educators should be equipped with the skills to recognize when a child is affected by their actions and know how to address the situation constructively. Continuous professional development in the areas of child psychology and communication can help teachers better understand and support their students' mental and emotional needs. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that all interactions within the educational setting contribute positively to the development of the	1909	2006.8536
Moreover, as a matter of fact, two rival Caliphates have existed in Islam for a long time and still exist. Just as a candidate for the Caliphate must have certain qualifications, so, according to Al mawardy, the elector also must be qualified. He must possess — (1) Good reputation as an honest man. (2) Necessary knowledge of State affairs. (3) Necessary insight and judgement. In theory all Muslims, men and women, possess the right of election. There is no property qualification. In practice, however, women and slaves did not exercise this right.	The electors are usually influential figures within the community, such as scholars, judges, and leaders of tribes. The process of election, while theoretically open to all, is thus often controlled by a select few who hold significant sway over political and religious matters. This concentration of power among a limited group can lead to issues of representation and legitimacy, as the broader populace may feel disconnected from the decision-making process. Furthermore, the concept of the Caliphate itself carries significant religious and historical weight. The Caliph is not merely a political leader but is also seen as a spiritual guide for Muslims, tasked with upholding and spreading the principles of Islam. This dual role adds complexity to the election process, as candidates must be evaluated not only on their political acumen but also on their religious devotion and understanding. The existence of multiple Caliphates historically has led to divisions and conflicts within the Muslim world, as different factions support different candidates based on theological, political, or ethnic lines. These rivalries can exacerbate tensions and lead to fragmentation within the community, undermining the unity that the Caliphate is meant	1908	1994.4579

"Imagine the pull that a revolutionist having land at his back must have over the homeless, houseless, starving crowds on Tower Hilllt The revolutionary spirit amongst the insurgent women should unpel them to rally in large numbers to the fighting ranks of the New Parliament, adapted as it is for free expression and action on * Here the syndicates of action, if they reckon with the criticisms passed upon the present money system by such recent experts as Arthur Kitson, author of ""The Money Problem ""; Cecil Balfour Phipson, author of ""The Redemption of Labour""; Capt."	P. M. Ashburner, who wrote extensively on economic reform; and others who have studied the roots of financial disparity, will find fertile ground for their theories. These theorists, who argue for a restructured economic system less dependent on traditional capitalistic frameworks, could provide the intellectual ammunition needed for a sweeping reform. The New Parliament, with its embracement of radical ideas and open forums, could serve as the perfect crucible for testing these new economic models. The revolutionist, armed with both the physical territory and the ideological backing of these economic reformers, could wield immense influence. By providing a tangible solution to the economic disenfranchisement felt by many, the revolutionist could easily galvanize the masses, turning idle support into active participation. The land serves not only as a symbol of stability and potential prosperity but also as a strategic asset in the logistics of organizing and sustaining a large-scale movement. Moreover, the New Parliament’s commitment to free expression would allow for the continuous evolution of these ideas, debated and refined in public view, thus maintaining engagement and support from the populace.	1911	1990.8407
"In each room there is one table set apart for specially fine work known as "" shiring, "" where the allowance of lamps is doubled. The lamps are generally well shaded, and glare is unusual. CONCLUSIONS. As was previously stated, for the perfect local lighting of work the three following conditions should be complied with : (1) The illumination must be adequate ; (2) "" glare "" effects must be absent; and (3) no troublesome shadows must be cast on the work. Adequacy. — In deciding on this point attention must be given to the class of work carried out, for a standard which would be quite sufficient for one class of work may be totally insufficient in another. For this purpose work may be divided into two classes — "" Inspect!ve "" and "" Detective, "" according as the work entails continuous application of the eye to one small point or area, or consists merely in keeping a general watch over a given process, actual labour being demanded only when some fault occurs."	"For ""Inspective"" work, such as that involved in fine mechanical adjustments, engraving, or detailed artistic endeavors, the illumination must be particularly intense and focused. This ensures that even the smallest details are visible, preventing strain on the eyes and enhancing the overall quality of the work produced. In contrast, ""Detective"" work, which might include overseeing operations in a factory setting or monitoring security feeds, does not require the same level of localized lighting. Here, broader, more diffuse lighting is adequate, allowing for clear visibility across a wide area without the need for intense focus on any one point. Glare. — Glare is a significant concern as it can lead to discomfort and reduced visibility, which in turn can decrease productivity and increase the risk of errors. To combat glare, lights should be positioned and shielded in such a way that they do not shine directly into the worker's eyes. The use of matte surfaces rather than glossy ones on equipment and tables can also help by reducing reflected light that can contribute to glare. Shadows. — Proper lighting must also eliminate shadows cast on the work"	1912	2006.1556
"Had the letter appeared only a few days before the election, the result would probably have been the same. All this may seem dubious enough now, but nobody doubted it then. Even with the spectacular exposure of the ""cooked"" envelope, a question remained in the popular mind, and I am sure that many persons still believe the letter genuine. There is little or nothing in the circumstances to convince a non partizan mind to the contrary, apart from General Garfield's denial and the Weaver letter. Although the envelope had evidently been tampered with, that fact could not be regarded as conclusive in the face of the positive statements of Abram S. Hewitt and Speaker Randall, the former made in public speeches and under oath on the witness stand, that the letter bore Garfield's signature. Discard the envelope altogether, yet their testimony stood. Explain the envelope as you would, yet their testimony was unimpeached."	"It remained a powerful element in the controversy, lending substantial weight to those who claimed the letter was authentic. The political ramifications of this assertion were profound, influencing public opinion and casting a shadow over the election proceedings. The so-called ""Garfield letter"" controversy exemplified how political machinations and media could intertwine, potentially manipulating the democratic process. The debate over the authenticity of the letter highlighted the broader issues of trust and credibility in political figures and the press. As the public grappled with these revelations, the political landscape was tinged with a sense of skepticism and disillusionment. This incident served as a stark reminder of the potent influence of alleged evidence and testimony in shaping historical and political narratives, regardless of the ultimate truth. The lingering doubts and debates continued to stir discussions and studies, underscoring the complexities of political communication and the interpretation of historical documents."	1911	2007.3307
When it was over Marcia shed a few secret tears — tears of painful sympathy, of an admiration which was half pity; and then threw herself once more, with — as it were — a gasp of renewed welcome, in to the dear, kind, many hued world on which Edward Newbury had turned his back. Presently Lester arrived. He became her constant companion through the inexhaustible spectacle of Rome; and she could watch him among the students who were his fellows, modest or learned as they, yet marked out from most of them by the signs he bore — signs well known by now to her — of a poetic and eager spirit, always and everywhere in quest of the human — of man himself, laughing or suffering, behind his works. The golden days passed by; the blue and white anemones bloomed and died in the Alban woods; the English crowd that comes for Easter arrived and departed; and soon Marcia herself must go home, carrying with her the passionate yet expectant feeling of a child tired out with happy days and dreaming of more to come.	"As the time drew near for her departure, a melancholy tinged her joy, casting a shadow over the sunlit ruins and the bustling piazzas. She wandered through the Forum, lingered by the Spanish Steps, and stood before the mighty Colosseum, trying to etch every detail into her memory. Each place held echoes of laughter and profound conversations with Lester, each step retraced a path of intellectual and emotional discovery.  Lester, sensing her sorrow, endeavored to distract her with tales of Roman lore, pointing out hidden gems in the city's vast historical tapestry. But even as he spoke, Marcia could see the unspoken words in his eyes, the reluctance to see their companionship end, possibly forever. On her last evening, they visited the Villa Borghese gardens. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, reflecting Marcia's mixed emotions—a beautiful ending to an unforgettable chapter of her life. They sat by the lake, watching the swans glide gracefully over the water, each lost in thought. ""Rome"	1913	1965.0016
"According to the official governmental records, this city from 1853 down to 1872 was one of the most completely vaccinated towns in England. During the years immediately preceding 1871, 95 percent of the births in Leicester were officially recorded as having been satisfactorily vaccinated; yet in 1871, while at the very height of the good vaccination record, Leicester became the storm centre of a smallpox epidemic of extreme severity, her deaths, according to the official records, during this epidemic numbering more than 3,500 per million population, or about one thousand per million more than the smallpox mortality in unsanitary London during the same epidemic. ""If ever a crucial test experiment existed, "" says an eminent medical authority, ""it was that of Leicester, in which an almost completely vaccinated community suffered far more from smallpox than did poorly vaccinated and terribly unsanitary London, with her crowded slum population."	"This led to a significant shift in public opinion and policy in Leicester. By the late 1870s, the citizens of Leicester began to vastly oppose the compulsory vaccination laws that had been rigorously enforced. They argued that the vaccination was not only ineffective but also potentially harmful. This culminated in the famous ""Leicester Anti-Vaccination Conference"" in 1885, which was attended by several key figures and large crowds, marking a pivotal moment in the anti-vaccination movement in the UK. Following this, Leicester adopted a unique approach to dealing with smallpox, focusing on stringent sanitary measures, isolation of the infected, and careful contact tracing. This method, often referred to as the ""Leicester Method,"" proved to be remarkably successful. In subsequent outbreaks, Leicester experienced significantly lower smallpox mortality rates compared to other cities that continued with compulsory vaccination. This experience challenged the prevailing medical orthodoxy in Britain and spurred debates and further research into the efficacy and safety of vaccinations. It also demonstrated the importance of community engagement and public trust in managing public health issues. The Leicester case remains a"	1911	2003.3271
is kept constant, then there is always a restoring couple. The necessary condition can be determined [graphically in each case, and the minimum tail or fin area necessary calculated. It is pointed out that if the helmsman is too slow, a larger restoring couple may sometimes be obtained by reducing the angle of helm rather than increasing it. If, however, the rudders are calculated as indicated, it is not probable that the angle a will increase excessively. With prompt rudder action it may be assumed that the helm angle is proportional to the angle of yaw, or t = (Ha where t is greater than unity. Then c=d c, = [n - ri (1 + tu av>;   381 from which the elegant theorem is obtained that, if I + iH is constant, a movable rudder is equivalent to a fixed empennage of coefficient n ri (1+iH).	This theorem implies that the dynamic stability of the vessel can be effectively managed by adjusting the helm in response to changes in yaw, thus maintaining a balance that compensates for any potential instability. It is essential to keep in mind that while the helm's responsiveness is crucial, the physical characteristics of the rudder—such as its size, shape, and the mechanical linkage to the helm—also play significant roles in how effectively it can counteract unwanted yaw movements. Further, the stability analysis must consider the hydrodynamic forces acting on the rudder and the entire hull. These forces vary with the speed of the vessel, the water's density, and the flow condition around the hull and rudder. Therefore, the practical application of this theoretical understanding requires careful empirical measurements or computational fluid dynamics simulations to optimize the rudder design for specific sea conditions and vessel speeds. In conclusion, the application of these principles ensures that the vessel maintains its course with minimal corrective actions, thus enhancing the efficiency of navigation and reducing the workload on the helmsman. This optimization of the rudder design and its operation is not only crucial	1912	2004.3221
"The two most important experiments are the Wages Boards of Victoria and the Arbitration Act in New Zealand. With regard to Wages Boards, the first question naturally asked is, how far they have actually had the effect of raising wages. The answer may best be given in the following paragraph : — "" The advances in thirteen Board trades previous to the Determination amounted in the aggregate to 26s. 7Jd., equivalent to 7'6 percent, on the combined average rates of these trades; in nineteen Board trades after the Determination the aggregate advance was 99s. 2d., or 16'5 percent, on the combined averages; and in twelve non board trades the aggregate advance was 42s."	"8d., or 10.5 percent, on the combined averages. The total average wage increase across all trades, therefore, stands at approximately 11.5 percent. This clearly indicates a significant positive impact on wages due to the intervention of Wages Boards."" Furthermore, the impact of these Boards extends beyond mere wage increases. They have also contributed to a greater stability in employment and improved working conditions, which are equally important for the welfare of the workers. The setting of minimum wages has helped to eliminate the undercutting of wages which was prevalent in many trades, thus ensuring a fairer and more equitable system. In contrast, the Arbitration Act in New Zealand has taken a different approach by focusing on resolving disputes through arbitration rather than direct wage control. This Act has been instrumental in maintaining industrial peace, which is a critical factor for economic stability and growth. The arbitration process has allowed for more nuanced negotiations between employers and employees, leading to mutually agreeable resolutions. This has not only helped in maintaining a steady increase in wages but has also fostered a collaborative work environment. Both these experiments, the"	1908	1974.2499
- The consideration of a contract may be described as that which either party suffers, surrenders, gives, does, or refrains from doing, or promises or pledges, for the obligation which he receives in return from the other party. It may be that which is given or promised by one party for that which is received or undertaken or relinquished by the other party. The consideration may consist of some right, proﬁt, interest, or beneﬁt accruing to one party, or it may be some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility endured, suffered, or undertaken by the other party. The thing given or surrendered may be any material thing of value, as money, an act, a right, or a privilege, or it may be simply a promise or an undertaking for a consideration of value. There must be some undertaking or obligation assumed or there is no contract; a mere exchange of two articles of value is not a contract. 61.	The law of contracts requires that for an agreement to be enforceable, there must be a mutual exchange of value, which constitutes the consideration. This principle ensures that each party to the contract has a vested interest in fulfilling their part of the agreement, and it helps prevent one-sided promises that might otherwise go unfulfilled. Consideration does not necessarily need to be equal in value but must be something legally sufficient and bargained for by the parties.  In some cases, consideration can be nominal, such as a dollar or other token amount, provided it is acknowledged as part of the contractual agreement and intended to bind the parties legally. This nominal consideration is often used in contracts where one party wishes to transfer something of significant value but requires the formality of a contract for legal purposes. Furthermore, consideration must be present at the time the contract is made; past consideration, or something given or promised before the contract was formed, is generally not sufficient to support a current contract. Exceptions to this rule may apply, such as when past actions are explicitly agreed upon as the basis for the current contract. In summary	1913	1961.1794
per sec. Hence the intrinsic energy and rigidity of the aether will probably meet the demands if we accept the views of aether and matter held by some of the greatest modern physicists. If a falling body does not gather its energy from the aether where does it get it? Lift a tonne to the height of 1,000 feet above the earth's surface and we have 2,000,000 foot pounds of potential energy, or preferably a body that in returning to its original position will gather 2,000,000 foot pounds of energy. Is this energy inherent in the body? Newton's letter to Bentley shows us that he was opposed to such a view.	He argued that gravity must be induced by some agent rather than being an inherent property of matter itself. This view aligns with the modern understanding that gravitational force, rather than being a direct property of objects, is a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime around mass according to Einstein's theory of general relativity. Consequently, the energy that a body gains while falling is not derived from the body itself but rather from its interaction with the gravitational field. This field, according to contemporary physics, can be thought of as an alteration in the structure of spacetime caused by the presence of mass.  The concept of the aether, once thought to be the medium through which light waves propagated, has been displaced by the theory of relativity, which posits that light and gravity propagate through the fabric of spacetime itself, not through any medium. However, the idea that the aether might possess intrinsic energy and influence gravitational interactions remains a fascinating historical perspective, reflecting the evolution of our understanding of the universe. These considerations lead us back to the original query: the energy a falling body accrues is borrowed from	1911	1997.8203
1 Hist■ and Antiq. 2. 108. Indeed, all the evidence there is points toward the full sympathy of the English Church with the tenor of the Caroline Books and the Frankfurt decrees. Nay, more, these were probably the expression of the English Church itself through Alcuin. Alcuin was not the kind of man to stand apart from the traditions in which he was bred — like Scotus Erigena, for example — but led his age only as the exponent of his age, never as a pioneer.	"In his correspondence and his writings, Alcuin's adherence to the orthodox positions of his time is manifest. He was a figure deeply entrenched in the ecclesiastical and educational reforms of Charlemagne's reign, often acting as a mediator between the Frankish court and the insular ecclesiastical authorities. His role in the adoption of the Caroline Books and the Frankfurt decrees is seen not as that of an innovator, but rather as a consolidator of existing theological and liturgical practices. His influence extended to the standardization of the liturgy and the script in the vast empire of Charlemagne, which was crucial in the Carolingian Renaissance. By promoting a uniform educational system and a clear theological stance against the Adoptionist heresy, which was debated in the Frankfurt Synod, Alcuin helped to forge a cultural and religious unity across the empire. His works, such as ""De fide Sanctae Trinitatis et de incarnatione Christi"" written in response to the Spanish Adoptionist challenge, underscored his commitment to defending the orthodox position. Thus,"	1904	1925.1932
1 Debet das Angels. Gedickt, Der Traum vom Heiligen Kreut. eg. Marlyrology, p. 206. The reference to the cross being clothed, wadum geweortod Cv. 15), may be a recollection of the veiling of the rood on Good Friday in the ceremony already described.	This veiling, a symbolic representation of mourning and respect, holds a profound place in the liturgical traditions surrounding the Passion Week. The rood, draped in black or dark violet cloth, stands as a stark emblem of Christ's suffering and the somber reflection of the faithful. This custom, deeply rooted in the medieval Christian observance, not only illustrates the deep interconnections between religious ritual and communal memory but also underscores the thematic elements of sacrifice and redemption that are central to the narrative of the Holy Cross. The practice likely evolved from earlier Christian traditions which symbolically associated textiles with honor and sanctity. In many cultures, covering an object, particularly a sacred one, denotes reverence and mystery, effectively setting it apart from the mundane. Thus, the veiling of the rood on Good Friday serves to remind the congregation of the extraordinary nature of Christ's sacrifice, simultaneously veiling the glory of the cross and revealing its profound significance in the Christian faith. This act of covering and uncovering resonates through the liturgy, echoing the themes of revelation and concealment inherent in the Christian faith.	1904	2007.0466
In coming out, after the President had left the tribune, the crowd filled in after him, and we had to fight our way out as best we could. The heat, which no thermometer could register — and there was no shade for the thermometer to register in — and the crowd were something fearful. People were almost crushed to death, and those who did the most crushing were the fat policemen, who stood in every one's way and on every one's toes, and barred the Sarah Bernhardt At the time of her Boston visit whole procession. Johan looked like an enormous poppy in his red uniform; the sun blazing through the glass roof almost set him on fire (the diplomats were begged to come in uniform and that meant coats padded and buttoned up to the chin). Johan tells fabulous stories of the number of stout old ladies he saved, who all threatened to faint away on his decorations.	The heat was surely making everyone more irritable and excessively tired. Ladies fanned themselves vigorously, causing a slight but insufficient breeze, while gentlemen mopped their brows with whatever handkerchief they could find. Amidst the chaos, Johan maneuvered through the crowd, his broad shoulders parting the sea of bodies as best he could. His tales did not exaggerate; more than one elderly woman clung to him, her face flushed from the heat and the panic of being trapped in such a crush. As we finally emerged from the building, the relief from the oppressive indoor heat was palpable, but the sun outside was no less forgiving. People scrambled for any sliver of shade they could find, leaning against the walls or under the sparse trees that lined the street. The air was still thick with the sound of heavy breathing and the murmur of countless conversations. Looking back at the building, the glass panels reflected the harsh sunlight, making it look as if it were glowing with an inner fire. It was a grand spectacle but one that many of us were happy to leave behind. The ordeal	1913	1966.9126
It will be seen that many of the offences tried in the police courts are not criminal in character, and would not brand the perpetrator of them as in any way a criminal. Offences against local Acts and bylaws or offences against the highway Acts or offences against police regulations are very seldom of a deliberately criminal character, and the commission of such offences does not as a rule involve the loss of personal reputation. On the other hand, offences against the Elementary Education Acts which usually means the deliberate and persistent neglect on the part of parents to send their children to school exhibit such a serious lack of the sense of parental responsibility and often involve such serious consequences on the children themselves, that they almost come within the category of actual crimes. One of the most conspicuous facts in connexion with the administration of the criminal law in recent years has been the tendency to mitigate the severity of punishments.	This shift towards leniency can be largely attributed to a growing recognition of the multifaceted causes of criminal behavior, including socio-economic factors, mental health issues, and the impact of upbringing. As a result, there has been an increased emphasis on rehabilitation over retribution, aiming to reintegrate offenders into society as productive members rather than merely punishing them. This approach is reflected in the introduction of alternative sentencing options such as community service, probation, and educational programs, which are designed to address the root causes of criminal behavior and prevent recidivism. Moreover, the judicial system has shown a greater willingness to employ restorative justice practices, where offenders and victims engage in mediated dialogue to repair harm and reconcile. This method not only supports victims but also promotes a deeper sense of accountability in offenders. The trend towards reducing the use of incarceration for non-violent offenses further underscores this transformative approach in criminal justice, prioritizing correction and prevention over punitive measures. This evolution in the philosophy of law enforcement and punishment reflects a broader societal shift towards a more compassionate and constructive handling of criminal offenses, recognizing the potential for change	1908	2007.3342
"It also keeps him in harmony with his fellows, since it obeys the law of averages, neither stringing up the least developed to the impossible standard of the exceptionally gifted, nor reducing the latter to the lower levels by denying him the results of his prowess. "" Can this be done ? "" students will ask who have followed the many lines of experiment tried by Industrial Democracy, * whether through piece work, time work, the card system, the bonus system, copartnership, etc., always seeking to solve this problem. The method is as follows: Experiments are made under varying conditions, ie., by individuals both above and below the average skill, strength, and experience, as well as under differing conditions of the material worked (say, hard wood or soft wood, clay land or sandy land, etc. ), and from numerous experiments averages are struck."	These averages are then used to set standard rates of work and compensation that are deemed fair and achievable. By this means, the efficiency of the worker can be assessed objectively, based on the average performance under standardized conditions. This approach helps to eliminate personal biases and provides a clear framework within which workers can operate. It also allows for adjustments to be made based on the specific circumstances of each worker, such as providing additional support or training to those who consistently perform below the average, and offering incentives or opportunities for advancement to those who exceed it. Furthermore, this method encourages a sense of fairness and transparency within the workplace. Workers can see that their efforts are evaluated according to a consistent standard, which helps to foster trust between employees and management. In turn, this can lead to increased morale and productivity, as workers feel valued and understood. Moreover, by continually collecting data and updating the averages, the system can evolve over time, adapting to changes in technology, materials, and worker skills. This dynamic aspect ensures that the standards remain relevant and effective, promoting continuous improvement and innovation within the industry. Ultimately, this approach	1911	2001.9982

The command of the sea was still in German hands, although in the House the Admiralty had reassured the country that in a few days we should regain the supremacy. A few days !

By night the West End, Pall Mall, Piccadilly, Oxford Street, Regent Street, Portland Place, Leicester Square, Whitehall, Victoria Street, and around Victoria Station were filled with idle, excited crowds of men, women, and children, hungry, despairing, wondering.

Troops patrolled the streets, their presence meant to be reassuring, but their grim expressions and the rifles slung over their shoulders only added to the sense of impending doom. Barricades were erected at strategic points, and citizens were subjected to frequent checks and searches"	1906	1955.5768
Gv denotes the weight of the aeroplane proper, Gvcp of the motor, Gs(jC)\c of the petrol and oil consumed. Al denotes the work done. On the assumption of a maximum value of the wind velocity, to, beyond which no flying takes place, a mean value of »/«, denoted by (t'/u)ot is obtained wiih the aid of meteorological data ; and the following values are taken as typical of the order of magnitude of the constants : — „ = 0-5, fl = 2kglUP, c = 1 P 1000 kg. km.\hour \= OS .kg] hp. hour. Diagrams are drawn showing AjNi plotted against v for different values of g and wmajr., A denoting the mean value of A; and also showing the cost of conveyance in marks per tonne km. plotted against v. The conclusions arrived at are that, for economy, the velocity, v, of the machine should exceed w, nax. by a definite, not very large, amount.	Furthermore, the efficiency of the aeroplane, defined as the ratio of the useful work performed to the total energy expended, increases as the disparity between v and w_max grows. This suggests an optimal cruising speed which balances fuel consumption against speed to maximize the aeroplane's operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The diagrams also illustrate that as v increases, the cost per tonne-km decreases up to a certain point, beyond which the benefits are outweighed by the increased fuel consumption and the aerodynamic penalties incurred at higher speeds. To further refine these findings, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess how changes in the values of β, c, and (w/u)_ot affect the overall performance and economics of flight. These analyses indicate that while moderate increases in β and c can improve the aeroplane's efficiency, they do so at the cost of higher initial expenditures and maintenance costs. Conversely, a lower (w/u)_ot ratio, which indicates more favorable wind conditions, consistently improves both efficiency and cost metrics. Thus, the operational strategy for maximizing the aeroplane's economic and functional performance	1912	1990.7582
"But on the record of the past and on common knowledge of the character of the American people, it is unwarranted to claim that they would unjustly and oppressively use the power to tax incomes. Nevertheless, some of the wealthier and more powerful members of the community, having long profited by tax discriminations in their favour, are probably now in the position of the prisoner at the bar who, on being assured by the judge that he would get justice, answered: ""That is just what I'M afraid of."" In spite of their grave apprehensions of injustice from a Federal income tax, the authors of this ""memorandum"" say: It should also be born in mind that New York may any day want to levy an income tax as a substitute for the present personal property tax land in order to relieve real estate. ... If Congress should also have and exercise the same power, the resources of the state in that respect, to provide for her own urgent public improvements, would be necessarily curtailed."	Thus, the argument goes that the imposition of both federal and state income taxes could potentially strain the financial capabilities of individuals and businesses alike, reducing the state's ability to fund essential services and infrastructure projects. This underscores a broader concern regarding the balance of taxation powers between state and federal governments, and the potential for overlapping tax liabilities to stifle economic growth and discourage investment. Furthermore, it highlights the perennial tension in American fiscal policy between the need for government revenue and the desire to maintain an economic environment conducive to wealth creation and retention. This tension is particularly acute in times of economic strain or when significant public investments are deemed necessary, such as during periods of war, national emergencies, or significant infrastructural overhauls. In this context, it is crucial for policymakers to consider not only the immediate fiscal benefits of taxation but also the long-term economic implications. The challenge lies in crafting a tax system that is equitable, efficient, and conducive to both economic growth and the funding of essential public services. This requires a nuanced understanding of both the economic landscape and the lived experiences of those who bear the tax burden—whether	1911	1999.711
Now, on examining the gas from the interior of several of these bulbs, old from use, it was found that helium was present. The air contains some helium; and it was not impossible, though unlikely, that it might have entered the bulb through the glass. But that idea was negatived by experiments made quite independently by Professor Norman Collie and by Mr. Hubert Patterson; each of them passed a stream of cathode rays through hydrogen; the rays impinged on the glass vessel; and after five hours both helium and neon were found in the gases pumped out of the bulb. Again, the helium and the neon might conceivably have entered from the outside air; but that was disproved by surrounding the bulb with an external vessel from which all air had been removed; helium and neon were still found in the gases which had been exposed to the cathode rays; none could have entered from without.	This remarkable discovery led to a series of further experiments designed to uncover the source of the helium and neon production. The scientists began to suspect that these noble gases were somehow being generated by the interaction of the cathode rays with the materials of the glass itself. To test this hypothesis, different types of glass were used in the construction of the bulbs and subjected to prolonged exposure to cathode rays. Consistently, the presence of helium and neon was detected in the evacuated gases, regardless of the glass type used. Further investigations involved the use of pure silica and other substances as the bulb material. Interestingly, when pure silica was used, the amount of helium and neon produced was markedly reduced, suggesting that the impurities in ordinary glass might be playing a critical role in the generation of these gases. This led to the speculation that elements within the glass, perhaps elements used as dopants or contaminants, were undergoing nuclear reactions under the bombardment of the cathode rays, releasing helium and neon as by-products. To explore this possibility, meticulous chemical analyses were conducted on the glass materials both before and after exposure to	1913	1991.4613
56. Plum leaf covered with arsenate of tead after 10 days. Showing how well it sticks to the foliage, another tree. This method  to  to medium sized trees with  the lighter spraying compounds  settle rapidly, such agitation is seldom sufficient, and where the  trees are so large that considerable periods occur between  movements of the wagon it is entirely insufficient. Another  objection to this method is that the partitions make it difficult   126  to clean out the tank and remove the coarse sediment which collects in the bottom. A better method of providing for agitation is by means of a rod running lengthwise of the tank, with perforated cross pieces about six or eight inches high, cut rounding to fit in the bottom of the tank, and twelve to sixteen inches wide, attached at every two and one half or three feet. There aro two methods of giving this apparatus the alternating backward and forward movement necessary for agitation.	One method involves the use of a mechanical linkage connected to the wheels of the spraying wagon. As the wagon moves, the wheels actuate the linkage which in turn causes the rod to move back and forth, agitating the mixture. This system is particularly effective for large orchards where the spraying wagon is constantly in motion, ensuring consistent agitation of the spray mixture. The other method utilizes a manually operated crank or lever, which can be operated by the driver of the wagon or an assistant walking alongside. This method allows for more controlled agitation and is useful in situations where the wagon moves infrequently or remains stationary for extended periods. However, it requires additional labor and may not be as consistent as the mechanically linked system. Both methods significantly improve the suspension of the spraying compounds in the solution, ensuring that the application to the trees is even and effective. Furthermore, these improved agitation systems help prevent the settling of particles, which can lead to clogging of the spray nozzles and uneven distribution of the pesticide or nutrient solution on the plants.	1914	1985.9656
If they do go on, they may recover as executors and the money when recovered will be assets in their hands Hence the advisability of a contractor’s making his executor or administrator a party to his contract Contracts founded on personal qualifications, as skill, ability, or integrity, such as the employment of an agent, a servant, an artist, an author, an architect, and an engineer, terminate with the death of the employer or employee in the absence of express stipulation.‘ A contract for the employment of an agent by a partnership is discharged by the death of one of the partners.‘ Therefore the legal repre centatives cannot enforce such agreements; and frequently, if the contract be for a completed structure or piece of work, the representatives cannot recover for the services performed. 12. Executor’s Liability on Contracts and for Torts of Party. — An executor or administrator has power to complete a contract made by the person he represents, but he cannot by virtue of the general powers of his office make contracts which shall bind the decedent’s estate. 'l‘he effect of such contracts is to bind the representative.‘ For goods or materials purchased for the beneﬁt of the estate he incurs a personal liability.‘ This would not apply probably to materials purchased in the execution of a building con’ tract of decedent, as executor or administrator.	However, he may recover from the estate if he shows that the expenditures were necessary and beneficial to the estate. It is imperative that executors and administrators act within the scope of their authority as delineated by the will or the laws of intestacy, as their actions can significantly impact the estate and its beneficiaries. Furthermore, it is important for executors and administrators to be aware that they can be held personally liable for any torts committed during the course of their administration if these acts are wrongful or negligent and not justifiable by the necessity of administration. They are, however, generally protected when they act in good faith and within the limits of their legal powers. In cases where the executor or administrator continues the business of the deceased, they should be particularly cautious. The continuation of business often involves entering into contracts and managing ongoing relationships which may expose the estate to significant risks. Executors and administrators must ensure that they have proper authorization under the will or by the court to engage in such activities, and they should seek professional advice to manage these risks effectively. In conclusion, while executors and administrators have the authority	1913	1951.6903

""Murders, while tragic, are often seen as distant tragedies, whereas divorce, with its messy human emotions, feels more accessible—almost relatable."" ""Exactly,"" he replied.

This type of man startles us by his originality, and brings into the world things before unknown. The history of civilization, however, is only half written when all the departures from mediocrity have been listed and analysed, for tradition clings inevitably to the coat tails of departure, and holds it close to solid ground. If the greater variability of men is the gift that fits them to explore new fields, nothing is more certain than that the less erratic organisation, both physical and mental, of women, fits them for administration, conservatism, tradition and culture These special aptitudes are sexual differentiations no less truly than bristling beards and flowing tresses, and under modern conditions, infinitely more important . Nothing, however, could be more fatal to any cause, involving either men or women, than failure to recognise that the natural endowments of the sexes are complementary, racially essential and, fortunately, bred in the bone.	Thus, it is not merely the exploration of new territories that advances civilization, but equally the preservation and refinement of the achievements thus gained. Women, in their roles as the bearers of culture and tradition, provide the necessary balance to the pioneering spirit of men, ensuring that society does not merely surge forward into chaos but grows with stability and order. It is in this interplay of exploration and conservation that the true progress of a society is made.  The error of underestimating the importance of either contribution stems partly from a misunderstanding of the nature of progress. It is not a linear race forward, but a complex dance that requires both innovation and preservation, each leading and following in turn. This balance ensures not only survival but flourishing—a dynamic equilibrium that allows for the continuous emergence of new ideas while safeguarding the wisdom of the past. In recognizing these complementary roles, we must also acknowledge the necessity of fostering an environment where both can thrive. This involves not only encouraging men and women to fulfill their potential in their respective areas of strength but also ensuring that they have the opportunity to cross traditional boundaries.

"""Now, "" we continued, ""let us repeat to you the story of a typical case as given to us but a few days since by a gentleman of the highest character and moral integrity, residing in the capital of one of our Southern commonwealths. 'Dr. 's cure, ' said this friend, 'is very interesting and it has naturally exerted a strong influence on those who knew the circumstances. For many years he had been one of the leading regular physicians of our city, and state, for that matter. Some years ago, however, he began to take opium and in time became a confirmed slave to that most seductive and dangerous drug. His health was wrecked. Time and again he made ineffectual efforts to break the accursed habit, but all to no purpose."	Each attempt left him weaker, both physically and mentally, until at last his friends despaired of his recovery. It was then that he heard of a new treatment, developed by a renowned specialist in addiction therapy, which involved a radical departure from the conventional methods of the time. With nothing left to lose, Dr. decided to give this new treatment a try. The process was arduous and required a complete isolation from his previous environment. He was taken to a secluded clinic where the treatment would take place under constant supervision. The regimen was strict and multifaceted, involving both physical detoxification and psychological counseling to address the underlying issues that led to his addiction. Remarkably, after several months of intense treatment, there were signs of improvement. Dr. 's physical health began to stabilize, and mentally, he was becoming more resilient. The cravings that once dominated his every waking moment were diminishing, and for the first time in years, he felt a glimmer of hope. Upon completing the treatment, Dr. returned to his community, his story becoming a beacon of hope for others suffering from similar	1911	2007.1166
There will be some trouble, probably murder, but this is a question for the officials to settle. The officials appear to have very much underestimated the number of chronic criminals, who are eligible for the indeterminate sentence. They calculate on the few very superior men, who drive about in motor cars, visiting out of the way mansions and castles, reckoning their haul in thousands of pounds sterling. These form but a drop in the bucket, when we think of the army of unskilled, troublesome pests, who seldom receive long sentences. Then there are the degenerates who commit revolting crimes, and are always a danger when at liberty. Mr. Gladstone's scheme does not appear sufficiently comprehensive. It is the man in the street, the girl in the shop, and the child in the highway, who have equal claims with the wealthy, for protection against organised crime. The Bill, with the highest respect to its promoter, presents some inconsistency in making an effort and suggesting a faint hope of reform. Reform ! Absurd.	The very notion presupposes a degree of moral elasticity that these hardened criminals, by the nature of their recidivism, conspicuously lack. What is required is not merely reform, but a radical transformation of both the system and the individual, which is rarely achieved through half-hearted legislative measures. Further, the focus on the high-profile, affluent criminals skews the perception of the problem. It's not the isolated cases of grand theft or elaborate fraud that gnaw at the foundations of societal order, but the pervasive, petty crimes committed by the desperate or the degenerate which form the bulk of offenses. These individuals, often neglected by society and the justice system alike, require a more robust and comprehensive approach. Education, rehabilitation, and community support offer more promise than the mere extension of punitive measures. Yet, these are scarcely addressed with the seriousness they demand. The indeterminate sentence, while philosophically appealing for its flexibility and focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, fails to account for the significant resources and systemic changes required to implement it effectively. Moreover, the protection of the general public, the everyday citizen,	1908	1975.8909
damp earth and vegetable debris. The Brown Froglet. C. signifera. The most active member of the genus, with well grown legs and long free toes. The tympanum is quite hidden. The upper surfaces are of various shades of brown or umber or grey, lighter or darker, with a dark broadish band on the head extending backwards in two longitudinal bands separated by a median band of the ground colour. The limbs have narrow dark cross bands, and the toes have successive darker and lighter rings of colour. As in the case of all the lower vertebrates the colour patterns are best seen in the young animal, as they often become less regular and more broken up in the adult. The under surfaces are dark spotted or marbled. It probably occurs all over the southern half of the continent, in southwest Australia, in Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales. It is one of the commonest frogs about Melbourne and Sydney. The Georgian Frog.	C. georgiana. This species is distinguished by its robust build and relatively shorter limbs compared to C. signifera. The tympanum is more visible, though still not prominent. The coloring is generally a deep, rich green which may vary to darker hues or even to a muddy brown depending on environmental factors. This variation helps the Georgian Frog blend effectively into its surroundings, primarily dense wetlands and marshy areas. The dorsal surface features irregular dark markings that can sometimes form a semblance of a stripe down the center. These markings are less defined in older specimens. The limbs display distinct banding, which is more pronounced in juveniles. The underbelly is creamy to yellowish, often speckled with tiny dark spots, providing a stark contrast to the darker dorsal colors. The Georgian Frog is predominantly found in the southeastern regions, thriving in Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Florida. It favors humid, shaded environments near bodies of fresh water. This frog's call is a deep, resonant croak, often heard during the evening and early night hours, particularly during	1909	2007.2289
Every lodging house, every hotel, and every boardinghouse was quickly crowded by the German officers, who remained to superintend the landing. Many machine guns were landed on the pier at Cromer, while the heavier ordnance were brought ashore at the gap and hauled up the fishermen's slope. Colonel Macdonald, who had carefully marked a cycling road map of the district with his observations driving in his own dog cart from one point to the other, met with a number of exciting adventures. While in Holt on Monday evening — after a long day of constant observation — he suddenly came face to face with Colonel Frolich, commanding the enemy's cavalry brigade, and was recognised.	"The situation was tense, as both men stared at each other, recognizing the peril of their encounter. Colonel Macdonald, who was in civilian attire, tried to appear nonchalant, tipping his hat as if he were merely an ordinary citizen enjoying an evening stroll. Colonel Frolich, however, was not so easily fooled. With a sharp, accusatory tone, he addressed Macdonald directly, calling him by name. ""Colonel Macdonald, isn't it? A long way from your post, I presume,"" Frolich remarked coldly, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. Macdonald, realizing that any attempt at further deception would be fruitless, maintained his composure. ""Indeed, Colonel Frolich. It seems we are both far from home,"" he replied, his voice steady despite the rising tension. For a moment, it seemed as though violence would erupt between the two military men right there in the quiet street of Holt. But Macdonald, understanding the potential consequences of such an action, decided on a different approach. ""Perhaps we can agree that this encounter"	1906	1967.486

"Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d. net. This charming travelogue by Elizabeth Yardley offers a vivid and delightful journey through the picturesque landscapes of England and France via motorcar. With keen observations and a light-hearted tone, Yardley brings to life the scenic beauty and cultural richness of the regions she explores. Accompanied by her insightful commentary on local customs, historical sites, and the adventures of road travel in the early 20th century, this book promises to be a delightful read for both avid travelers and armchair tourists alike.  Illustrated with photographs taken by the author herself, ""A Motor Tour through England and France"" not only guides readers through various landmarks and lesser-known gems but also discusses the nuances of undertaking such a journey during a time when motor travel was just becoming accessible to the wider public. From bustling city streets to serene rural landscapes, Yardley's narrative encapsulates the thrill and challenges of early automobile travel."	1912	1971.4933
It is well to point out just here that the American Medical Association is advancing along three distinct lines in its determined plan to establish state medicine and fasten an army of medical pensioners on the tax payers. First, it aims at establishing a national department of health at Washington. This for twenty years has been one of the cherished plans of the Association. Second, it is annually pushing forward with increasing vigour its campaign to secure medical monopoly in the various states.	Third, it is advocating for more stringent regulations and control over the practice of medicine, aiming to ensure that all practitioners meet a standardized level of competence and ethics. These efforts, while argued to protect public health, also raise concerns about the centralization of power and the potential for bureaucratic overreach. Critics argue that this could lead to a system where medical care is more about adhering to government mandates rather than focusing on patient-centered care.  Moreover, the Association's push for a national department of health is seen by some as a step towards the socialization of medicine in America, a concept that has been met with resistance from those who favor a more market-driven approach. This division highlights the ongoing debate between public welfare and individual freedoms, a debate that is not just confined to the realm of medicine but touches upon the broader philosophical differences regarding the role of government in society.  As these initiatives continue to unfold, it will be crucial to monitor their implications not only for the medical profession but also for the general public, whose access to healthcare could be profoundly affected by these changes.	1911	2007.4955
They paid for them with bills on the British Government, which were by no means acceptable to the shopkeepers. However, it was ' Hobson's choice' — that or nothing. The Germans soothed them by saying that the British Army would be smashed in a couple of weeks, and the defrayment of such bills would be among the conditions of peace. The troops generally seemed to be well behaved, and treated those inhabitants with whom they came in contact in an unexceptionable manner. They did not see very much of them, however, as they were kept hard at work all day with their entrenchments and were not allowed out of their billets after eight o'clock that evening.	The presence of the German soldiers in the town was, for the most part, marked by a strict adherence to military discipline. Officers were frequently seen patrolling the streets, ensuring that their men adhered to the rules set forth and maintained a respectful distance from the local populace. The townspeople, for their part, maintained a cautious but civil demeanor, their daily routines disrupted but not entirely halted by the occupying force. The local authorities were tasked with mediating interactions between the soldiers and the civilians, a role that required delicate negotiation and firm administration. They worked to ensure that the necessary provisions were supplied to the troops without causing undue strain on the town’s resources. This balance was precarious, as the uncertainty of the war loomed over every transaction and interaction. In private, the conversations among the townspeople were tinged with anxiety and speculation about the future. There were whispers about the strength of the British forces and the possible outcomes of the war. Some held out hope for a swift and favorable resolution, while others feared prolonged conflict and suffering. Despite these undercurrents of fear and uncertainty, life in	1906	1975.0831
"A wild riot broke loose, the natives lining up for open battle with the foreigners. In the general confusion and fighting he was temporarily forgotten. It was not until the foreman and his assistant, with drawn revolvers, had quelled the disorder, that some remembered seeing him running out of the foundry. Some of the Polaks started to give chase, but the foreman ordered them back. He had seen these things happen before, and knew what to do. The boy would be found easily enough — if he was wanted. At the point of his revolver, he sent them one and all back to work, excited and muttering. He telephoned to the town for a doctor — and others. Drawn by H. C. Wall half tone plate engraved by F. A.

The atmosphere in the foundry remained tense, the air thick with unspoken accusations and silent grievances. The workers resumed their positions, their movements mechanical, their minds elsewhere. The foreman paced back and forth, his eyes scanning the room, aware of the simmering unrest that lingered beneath the surface. The incident had shaken everyone, and the echo of the revolver's report seemed to hang in the air like a grim reminder of the fragility of peace. As the day wore on, the police arrived, their presence a stark contrast to the soot-covered faces and sweat-stained shirts of the workers. They began their inquiries methodically, speaking in hushed tones to the foreman, jotting down notes, their eyes missing nothing. The workers watched warily, their distrust of the authorities mingled with a desperate need for justice, or at least for some kind of resolution. The boy's absence was a void that no one could fill, his fate a specter that haunted the corners of the foundry. Whispers circulated among the workers, speculations and theories concocted in	1913	1994.0819
The sketch at the bottom of Figure 20 is of an electrical thermometer which is essentially a Wheatstone Bridge. Three resistors R, R, R, are constant. A fourth resistance T varies with temperature, increasing with rising and decreasing with lowering temperature. WC is a wet  34 cell of proper voltage, which forces electricity through the circuit. The amount of current passing through the galvanometer G depends on the resistance of T. Since the resistance in T changes with tempera RC R we Figure 20. Main features of two commonly used thermometers. ture, the unit containing T, when exposed to the air, serves as a measuring device for recording temperature. A scale about G must be calibrated to read degrees. Good results can be obtained with an electrical thermometer. ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE As noted, both temperature and humidity vary considerably from point to point, laterally and vertically in the atmosphere.	The measurement of atmospheric pressure, therefore, becomes crucial in understanding and predicting weather patterns. A barometer is the instrument typically used to measure atmospheric pressure. This instrument operates based on the principle that changes in atmospheric pressure will affect the height of a column of mercury or the compression of a sealed air chamber. There are two main types of barometers: the mercury barometer and the aneroid barometer. The mercury barometer consists of a glass tube filled with mercury, inverted in a container of mercury. Changes in atmospheric pressure cause the mercury level in the tube to rise or fall, and the height of the mercury column is read against a calibrated scale to give the atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, the aneroid barometer uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell, which expands or contracts with changes in pressure. These movements are amplified by mechanical linkages to move a needle on a dial, which is calibrated to read the atmospheric pressure. Both types of barometers are essential tools in meteorology, used not only in weather stations but also in homes and on ships	1913	1968.8323

Acetonuria and fatty liver may both be associated with starvation, diabetes, phlorrhizine glycosuria in starvation in dogs, with the after effects of anaesthetics, in cyclical vomiting, in marasmus in infants and many other conditions. To sum up then, by piecing together what is probable with what is known of the chemistry of the processes by which the energy of fat molecules is rendered available in the animal body : the fat is transported to the liver, unsaturated unions are there introduced into the fatty acids, and possibly there, too, the complex compounds of fatty acids with phosphorus and nitrogen built up. The unsaturated products, which are next found in the cells of other organs throughout the body, break down, probably where the unsaturated links have been introduced, and the lower acids so formed, by successive oxidation at the /9 carbon atom, break down further to molecules of the size of acetic acid, which are lastly completely burnt to carbonic acid and water.	This process, intricate and multifaceted, highlights the central role that the liver plays in fat metabolism and the complex biochemical pathways that are activated during different physiological and pathological states. The liver not only acts as a hub for fat conversion but also as a critical mediator in maintaining energy balance within the body. Furthermore, the breakdown products of these metabolic processes, such as acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, serve as vital energy sources during periods of fasting or carbohydrate restriction, indicating an adaptive mechanism to sustain vital functions under nutritional stress. Moreover, the involvement of these metabolic pathways in various disease states underscores the importance of understanding these processes in greater detail. For instance, the excessive accumulation of ketone bodies can lead to ketoacidosis, a serious condition often associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Similarly, disruptions in the normal metabolism of fats can contribute to the development of fatty liver disease, which if left unchecked, may progress to more severe liver damage. Thus, the study of these metabolic pathways not only provides insights into fundamental biological processes but also has significant implications for the diagnosis, management	1913	2006.9572

However, by the mid-18th century, there was a movement towards restoring the original text. Garrick himself played Macbeth with considerable success, beginning in 1744, although he did introduce some modifications to the play. It wasn't until April 14, 1794, at Drury Lane, that Macbeth was performed entirely unaltered, under the management of John Philip Kemble, which was hailed as a theatrical milestone. King Lear. Nahum Tate's adaptation of King Lear, which famously gave the play a happy ending, dominated performances from its introduction in 1681	1912	1992.3563
"""Can'T I win her even to this?"" he thought, but he had never got near her, and he could not now. Go she would. ""You have no right to waste yourself in sorrow for that old sin, "" he told her. ""What good is a sterile repentance? You owe something to these very neighbours; but what you want to do is to live apart, and strain after an ideal of personal spotlessness. You are like a child putting out its hands for that moon; and it is beyond reach, and a burned out planet, anyhow."" ""You have always been so upright, and comfortable in your world, "" she retorted. What she said was far from the truth, and recalled the reality to his mind; and in the pause before answering he went through a bitter minute. ""Do you think mine such a satisfactory life?"""	"he replied, his voice tinged with a weariness that seldom showed. ""Believe me, I have my own battles, my own regrets. But I've learned—it's essential—to focus on what can be changed, and to let go of what cannot. The past, however haunting, is immutable."" She looked at him then, really looked, and for a moment he saw the flicker of understanding—or was it empathy?—in her eyes. ""Perhaps,"" she began, her voice softer, ""perhaps I am chasing shadows, holding onto a purity that was never meant to be held so tightly."" He nodded slowly. ""And perhaps in doing so, you're not allowing yourself the grace of living fully in the present. There's a balance, you see, between acknowledging the past and not letting it consume you.""

"The shoulder blades are also signed, so that there may be a defence on all sides.'' Wulf stan says: ' In the christening that one performs previous to baptism there is great significance. When the priest christeneth, he breathes on the man, then signs him in modum cructs. After that, through God's might, the devil becomes speedily much discouraged."" Of the use of the sign in particular rites there is no need of discussion here. As far as I can discover, its use in the various ceremonies of the Anglo-Saxon church was the same as in the Mother Church. It was used a countless number of times, giving sanctity and weight to every rite — common to all and uniting them all. But its usefulness was not confined within the walls of the church or monastery. It was the Christian's ready weapon for every time of need."	In times of temptation, danger, or distress, the sign of the cross was employed as a means of divine protection and a symbol of invoking God's grace. It was believed to ward off evil spirits, heal the sick, and bring comfort to the troubled. The sign was also a common feature in the daily lives of the faithful, used during prayer, upon waking, before meals, and at bedtime.  Furthermore, the sign of the cross had a significant role in the rites of passage which marked the journey of life from cradle to grave. From baptism, where it first marked the believer, to the final anointing at the time of death, this sacred sign was a constant reminder of the Christian's journey through life under the protection and guidance of the divine. In the public sphere, the cross was a symbol of communal identity and spiritual solidarity. It adorned flags and banners, was carved into the doors of homes, and stood on the wayside as a testament to faith. Its presence in courts and assemblies underscored the belief that justice and authority were ultimately derived from God. Thus,	1904	1887.0928

Spraying with a strong stream of water may also help to physically remove some of the lice from the leaves. For more persistent cases, the application of insecticidal soap or a neem oil solution can be beneficial. These should be applied thoroughly, ensuring to reach the undersides of leaves where aphids often congregate. Additionally, introducing natural predators such as ladybugs or lacewings into the environment can provide long-term control by reducing aphid populations naturally. These beneficial insects feed on aphids and can help maintain a balanced ecosystem, preventing future infestations. For severe infestations, systemic insecticides, which are absorbed by the plant and poison the aphids when they feed on the sap, can be considered. However, these should be used as a last resort due to their potential impact on beneficial insects and the environment. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and consider the timing of applications to minimize any adverse effects.	1914	2005.9998

Schweie Geotech., ser. 3, Bern, 1904.   n a;  THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE 3°9 THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE PROFESSOR WHITMAN AND THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY At the annual meeting of the corporation of the Marine Biological Laboratory held at Woods Hole in August, resolutions were adopted recording the obligation of the laboratory to the great man who more than any other was responsible for making it what it is, and after the adjournment of the meeting the trustees and members of the corporation visited the quiet graveyard by the sea where lies the body of Charles Otis Whitman."	His grave, marked by a simple stone, lies beneath the sprawling branches of an ancient oak, a tranquil spot fitting for a man who devoted his life to the study of nature and the mysteries of life. Professor Whitman, who founded the laboratory in 1888, believed profoundly in the power of scientific research to reveal the fundamental principles of biology. Under his guidance, the Marine Biological Laboratory quickly became a hub for groundbreaking research and a gathering place for some of the most distinguished scientists of the time. Professor Whitman's legacy at Woods Hole is not merely one of scientific achievement, but also of fostering a community of scholars dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. His vision was for a place where both professional scientists and students could work side by side, engaging in research that would push the boundaries of human understanding of the biological sciences. This ethos of collaboration and education continues to guide the laboratory to this day. In recognition of his contributions, the laboratory has continued to expand both its research facilities and its educational programs. The Whitman Center, named in his honor, hosts researchers from around the world, providing them	1911	1988.6504
The following table is drawn up from results obtained by Dr. Llewellyn : 680 lamps were tested, each trimmed to the height at which it would be used at work. The pits are consecutive pits in the same valley. The first is the highest in the valley, and consequently the oldest and least up to date in the matter of lamps and ventilation : — The following are Dr. Llewellyn's conclusions: — The light given by the modern oil safety lamps at the coal face is often less than a third of a candlepower, and is never more than half a candle power. The illumination falling on the coal face in an open light mine is about five times the amount obtaining in a safety lamp mine. The incidence of nystagmus in an open light pit is about a sixth of that in a safety lamp pit. The incidence of nystagmus is inversely proportional to the amount of illumination at the coal face.	Dr. Llewellyn further emphasizes the critical need for improved lighting in mines to enhance miners' safety and productivity. He suggests that advancements in lamp technology and better ventilation systems could significantly alleviate the harsh conditions faced by miners. These improvements, he argues, would not only reduce eye strain and the resultant nystagmus but could potentially decrease the risk of accidents due to poor visibility. Moreover, Dr. Llewellyn advocates for regulatory changes that would establish minimum illumination standards in mines. He points out that such regulations are already in place in various other industries where visual acuity is critical for safety, and mining should not be an exception. In his report, Dr. Llewellyn also discusses the potential use of electric lamps, which provide much brighter and more reliable light compared to oil safety lamps. He acknowledges the concerns about electric sparks in potentially gaseous environments but notes that recent technological advancements have led to the development of safer, enclosed electric lamp designs that could be suitable for use in more mines. Overall, Dr. Llewellyn's findings stress the importance of re-evalu	1912	2005.7638
As with the two theories of origin we have thus briefly examined, so it will be found to be with other theories that have been suggested. They can not, any of them, derive support from the use of the argument of survivals in historically known languages; they all reduce themselves to merely speculative doctrines. So much for general considerations on language history. Returning to the gradual process of change which has been seen to be characteristic of all speech, we may ask ourselves what is the most central or basic factor in this never ceasing flux. Undoubtedly the answer must be: phonetic change or, to put it somewhat more concretely, minute or at any rate relatively trivial changes in pronunciation of vowels and consonants which, having crept in somehow or other, assert themselves more and more and end by replacing the older pronunciation, which becomes old-fashioned and finally extinct.	This phonetic evolution is often so gradual and imperceptible that speakers themselves are unaware of the changes taking place within their own speech patterns. Over generations, these subtle shifts accumulate, leading to significant differences in dialects and eventually, in some cases, to the development of entirely new languages. The causes of phonetic change can be varied, including physiological adaptations, influence from other languages or dialects, and even socio-cultural factors that favor certain pronunciations as more prestigious or desirable. Furthermore, phonetic change is frequently the starting point for other kinds of linguistic shifts. As pronunciations alter, they can trigger morphological changes, such as the modification of word endings or the creation of new grammatical forms. Syntax, the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences, may also adjust to accommodate new phonetic structures. Thus, while phonetic change might seem minor or insignificant at first, it actually plays a pivotal role in the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of language. This ongoing transformation underscores the organic, living quality of language, which, like a living organism, adapts and	1911	2006.567
By creative selection this life has a direct and spontaneous embodiment in all art that endures. But in this interpretation we must not exclude aught of human existence that lives. We are on sure ground when we protest that no form can be imposed upon life; but every living thing is informed. The currents of human existence drift chartlessly, but not without purpose. Our interpretation seeks to reach the quality of the purpose, not any plan involved.	Thus, the artist must capture not merely the appearance of life, but its essence. Every brushstroke, every note, every word must pulse with the life it seeks to represent. This is what gives art its power and its timeless appeal. It is not enough for the artist to be a mere recorder of the visible world; he must delve deeper, exploring the underlying emotions, the unspoken dreams, and the quiet despair that define the human condition. In doing so, the artist transcends the limitations of time and place, creating works that speak to universal truths and fundamental human experiences. This approach to art demands not only technical skill but also a profound empathy and a keen insight into the human psyche. It requires an openness to the myriad forms of life and an acceptance of their complexity. For in the chaos and contradictions of life, there lies a beauty and a truth that is profoundly moving. The artist, therefore, must be both a keen observer and a compassionate participant in the drama of existence, striving always to capture the fleeting moments that, together, weave the tapestry of human life.	1913	1991.1093

His eyes, clouded with the years of solitude and the harshness of the landscape, suddenly sharpened as they fixed on me. ""But you, you're young. What brings you out to this godforsaken stretch?""

"What remains is termed by Wundt purely "" magischer Zauber "" : action from a distance in an incomprehensible way. The origin, then, of the belief in magic, according to Wundt, is to be found in primitive man's a priori assumption that man alone does things, that he alone has the power to do things. An event sufficiently striking to arrest attention is accounted for by the satisfactory explanation that somebody did it — unseen, at a distance and mysteriously or marvellously. The power thus to work marvels then differs from the mana which MM. Hubert and Mauss invoke, because mana resides according to them in spirits or demons and in the magical rites, from the beginning, as well as in man; whereas the power on which Wundt relies is that supposed to reside in the human will, that is, in the human soul, alone."	This belief, deeply rooted in the perception of human agency as the sole initiator of actions, leads to an anthropomorphic interpretation of all phenomena. Primitive man, unable to divorce his own consciousness from the workings of the world, attributes to other beings and objects a similar agency. This anthropomorphism extends not only to animate beings but also to inanimate objects, which are often imbued with personal qualities and perceived as capable of intentional action. The magical worldview thus emerges as a natural extension of this anthropocentric perspective. Events that cannot be explained through direct human action are still interpreted through the lens of human-like agency, leading to the assumption of hidden forces at work. Magic, in this context, serves as a means of conceptualizing and influencing these forces, which are thought to operate in ways analogous to human intentions but through invisible, mysterious channels. The distinction Wundt makes between his concept of magical power and the concept of mana is crucial. While mana suggests a diffuse, impersonal force that permeates objects and beings, Wundt's notion centers on the human will as the primary locus of	1908	2003.0812
"The other brothers of the monastery also made use of the lion's services, and even set him to watch the monastery ass while it was grazing. One day the lion returned to the monastery without the ass, and Guerassim, thinking that the natural leonine appetite had accounted for the beast of labour, said to the lion, "" Henceforth pou shall be the monaster}' ass""; panniers were put on the king of beasts, and ho carried their grain and their pi tellers, and he brought water from Jordan. The lion, who seems to have been more saintly even than Guerassim himself, served meekly, and in those days when the pilgrims came down to Jordan he not only brought up water, but chased the peasants from the sacred river to the monastery, where they paid the brothers good money to pray for the health of their bodies and the peace of soul of their fathers and grandfathers. At last, coming back one day, the lion found that Guerassim was dead. From that hour he had no more joy in life. When the saint was buried, the monks showed the lion the tomb, and there he stretched himself out and expired. Poor old lion!"	His mighty heart, which had borne the burdens of the monastery and the loss of his wild freedom, could not endure the weight of grief for his departed master. The monks, witnessing the lion's loyalty and despair, were deeply moved. They buried him beside Guerassim, marking the grave with a simple stone that bore the image of a lion and a cross. Over time, the story of the lion's devotion spread beyond the monastery walls, traveling with pilgrims and traders to distant lands. The tale of the lion and Guerassim became a beloved legend, symbolizing faithfulness and the unexpected sanctity found in nature's wildest creatures. Each year, on the anniversary of their deaths, the monks held a small service at the graves, which attracted not only local villagers but also curious travelers. The site, once a simple spot in a modest monastery, gradually became a place of pilgrimage. People came to pay homage to the saint and his loyal lion, bringing offerings and seeking blessings.

"It goes without saying that this can only happen when the woman in question has already achieved her own end (because, otherwise, envy of a contemporary, and the fear of having her own chances jeopardised by others, would overcome other considerations). She must first of all attain her own union, and then she is ready to help others. Women are altogether to blame for the unpleasant associations which are so unfortunately connected with "" old maids."" One often hears men talking respectfully of an elderly woman; but every woman and giri, whether married or single, has nothing but contempt for such a one, even when, as is often the case, they are unconscious that it is so with them."	This contempt, though rarely expressed as openly as in male circles, manifests in subtler exclusions and a patronizing tone, which can be even more cutting. It is a societal construct deeply ingrained, not born out of malice but out of a longstanding tradition of valuing women largely on the basis of marital status and progeny. This is a reflection of societal norms that dictate a woman's worth is significantly tied to her relationship with men and her role as a mother. However, it is crucial to recognize the role women themselves play in perpetuating these stereotypes. By internalizing and transmitting these values, they reinforce a system that undervalues their broader contributions and capabilities. It is often the case that once a woman secures her own position—be it through marriage or achieving economic independence—she feels a sense of security that can either lead to complacency or, more positively, provide a platform from which to support other women. Ideally, this latter scenario should be the norm. Women who have navigated the complexities of societal expectations and emerged with a secure sense of self are in a	1911	2007.554
They will frequently strip a bush of its foliage in a few days time if left to themselves. When fullgrown they are three quarters of an inch long. There are two broods of these worms; the first appearing before or about the time the fruit is ripe and the second, two or three weeks later. The mature insect is a fly, somewhat resembling the house fly. Fig. 40. Currant Worm at work. Remedies.	To combat the currant worm effectively, gardeners can employ several methods. The first and most common remedy is the application of insecticidal soap or horticultural oil. These should be sprayed directly onto the affected bushes, thoroughly coating the worms and the leaves they are feeding on. It is crucial to reapply these treatments at intervals specified by the product instructions, especially after rain. Another biological control involves introducing natural predators of the currant worm into the garden. Ladybugs and lacewings are beneficial insects that feed on the eggs and larvae of the currant worm, helping to keep their population in check. For those preferring a more hands-on approach, manually picking off the worms from the bushes can also be effective, especially in smaller gardens. This should be done early in the morning when the worms are less active. In cases of severe infestation, a stronger chemical insecticide may be necessary. However, it is important to choose a product that is safe for use on food crops and to follow the application guidelines strictly to avoid harming beneficial insects and the environment. Lastly, preventive measures can also	1914	2006.6945
Before bringing my lecture to a conclusion two matters must be briefly discussed. One of these, which is mainly of theoretical interest, relates to the development of the parasite's association with its host, the other, of more practical significance, to the methods of greatest promise in the study of insect parasitism. We need not stop to consider cases of the tapeworm type which reach their hosts by chance. In the two other types which I have distinguished, we have the association with the host established through the initiative of the larval parasite itself (Sacculina type) or through the parasite's mother (insect type).	In the Sacculina type, the larval parasite actively seeks out and invades the host, developing a complex life cycle that often involves dramatic morphological transformations and a high degree of physiological integration with the host. This type of association suggests a long evolutionary history, where both parasite and host have co-evolved mechanisms for interaction, often leading to a delicate balance between parasite virulence and host resistance. On the other hand, in the insect type, the mother of the parasite plays a crucial role by selecting an appropriate host for her offspring, often laying eggs directly on or near the host. This strategy not only ensures that the larvae have immediate access to their required resources upon hatching but also places significant evolutionary pressure on the mother to accurately identify and utilize suitable hosts. This can lead to highly specialized relationships where the parasite is adapted to exploit a single host species or a closely related group. Turning to the methods of study, recent advances in molecular biology and genetics offer promising new tools for understanding these complex interactions. Techniques such as gene sequencing and CRISPR gene editing allow researchers to identify and manipulate the genetic	1911	2007.3666
Point  to point variations also occur in the tropical and in the polar zones. On the continent of Africa, air over the Sahara Desert may be so dry as to contain only a few parts of water per 1000, whereas a few hundred miles to the south the air may contain 30 parts per 1000. Average parts per 1000 of water in air over central and eastern United States varies from 12 to 20 in Summer and from 1 to 5 in Winter. On the West Coast, the difference is not so great because of the prevailing westerly wind which tends to erase seasonal differences. SOURCES OF WATER VAPOUR.	Water vapor in the atmosphere originates primarily from two sources: evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor, and it occurs predominantly over bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. This process is significantly influenced by temperature, with higher temperatures increasing the rate of evaporation. Consequently, tropical regions, with their warmer climates, typically contribute more water vapor to the atmosphere. Transpiration, on the other hand, involves the release of water vapor from plants. As plants absorb groundwater through their roots, they lose water vapor from their leaves during photosynthesis in a process known as transpiration. This combined water loss from soil and plants is often referred to as evapotranspiration. Another less substantial source of atmospheric water vapor is sublimation, where ice and snow convert directly into vapor without first melting into water. This is particularly prevalent in polar regions and at high altitudes. Together, these natural processes contribute to the global water cycle, which plays a critical role in weather patterns and climate regulation. As water vapor rises and co	1913	1998.3745
At once I necessarily take the attitude of the observer, of the explaining psychologist,  82   • I watch the special mental features, separate the single  functions, observe the effects of various conditions on the emotions and feelings and ideas of the child and feel it my duty to follow his behaviour with scientific carefulness. At the other extreme I think of how I talk with my own child in mental health and strength here in my room and the father's love reaches out to the happiness of the young soul. How absurd it would seem to me to observe this mind and to disentangle it into its different parts. My warm enjoyment grasps the young personality as a whole and feels with its emotions. There we have the attitude of a scientist, here the attitude of life, there impartial observation, here personal interest, there explanation, here appreciation, there search for causes and effects, here understanding of the unity of purpose, there psychology, here sympathy.	In this duality of roles, the tension between detachment and engagement, between analysis and affection, becomes a daily reality. The psychologist within me strives for objectivity, to see patterns and predict behaviors, to apply theories and gather data. Yet, the father within rebels against this dissection of what is so deeply personal and immediate. It is not merely a subject to be studied but a relationship to be lived and cherished. This conflict, however, is not without its benefits. It brings a unique depth to both my professional observations and my personal interactions. The scientific approach informs my understanding with a broader perspective, allowing me to appreciate not just the immediate but the developmental trajectory of the child. Conversely, the depth of personal experience enriches my scientific work, lending it a sensitivity and relevance that pure observation could never achieve. Thus, while at times cumbersome, this dual perspective fosters a richer comprehension and a more nuanced approach to both my roles. It challenges me to integrate the rigor of science with the warmth of personal connection, striving always to balance the insights of psychology with the imperatives of fatherly love	1909	2006.9199
By root cuttings. Most of the varieties of raspberries coming under the first three species mentioned produce suckers from the roots and these are generally used to start new plantations, but when there is a shortage for this purpose it is cus    267  Fig. 121. Raspberry Plants. A. Dormant plant ready for transplanting. B. Growth started too much to transplant. ternary to grow plants of the suckering kinds from root cuttings, which may be made as follows: In the autumn, after the plants have stopped growing, the roots are taken up, cut into  pieces two or three inches long and put in boxes with alternate layers of sand or loam.	These boxes should then be stored in a cool, frost-free place over the winter months. The temperature should be just high enough to prevent freezing but not so warm as to encourage premature growth. During this period, the cuttings should be kept slightly moist, but care must be taken to avoid overwatering, as this can lead to rot.  As spring approaches and the threat of frost diminishes, the boxes can be moved to a warmer area to encourage growth. Once the cuttings begin to sprout, they should be monitored closely. The emerging shoots will initially be quite fragile and susceptible to damage from too much direct sunlight or drying out. When the shoots have grown a few inches and appear robust, they can be transplanted into a nursery bed or directly into their final location in the garden. It is important to ensure that the soil in the new location is well-prepared, rich in organic matter, and well-draining. The young plants will need regular watering, particularly during dry spells, to help establish their root systems. By using root cuttings, gardeners can effectively propagate	1914	2000.2897

The scale is divided into 140 parts, each of which represent inch extension between the pairs of gripping points when the microscope is Fig. 221. — Ewing's extensometer. in correct adjustment, estimations to ^ of a division giving a reading to SOo00 inch. D is a means of adjusting the cross wire in focus, and E is an illuminating mirror.	To perform measurements, the specimen is fixed between the two pairs of gripping points and the device is zeroed. As the specimen is subjected to tension, the thick wire moves relative to the fixed cross wire, and this motion is observed through the microscope. The operator carefully monitors the scale within the eyepiece, noting the position of the wire edge against the divisions. Precise adjustments can be made using the focusing knob D, ensuring that the cross wire and the edge of the thick wire are clearly visible and sharply defined. The mirror E serves to direct light onto the specimen and the wire, enhancing visibility and accuracy during the measurement process. This arrangement is critical for achieving reliable results, as proper illumination helps to minimize errors caused by poor visibility or optical illusions. As the material is stretched, the operator records the displacement of the wire edge at regular intervals of applied force. Each division and sub-division on the scale corresponds to a specific amount of strain experienced by the material.

The blood ordinarily contains about 0-2 to 0-3 percent of fat But even in the case of a starving man, requiring, let us suppose, 2,000 calories per diem, and obtaining nine tenths of this amount from his reserve sat, the blood would have to transport in twenty-four hours only some 200 grms.	of fat, an amount which could be readily held in solution in the normal stream of circulation without serious difficulty. However, the mechanism by which this fat is mobilized from the adipose tissues and then transported to where it is needed remains a complex and not fully understood process. It involves the actions of various hormones and enzymes which facilitate the breakdown of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. These components are then released into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to other tissues such as the liver, muscle, and heart. Furthermore, during periods of increased energy demand, such as during prolonged exercise or fasting, the rate of lipolysis increases substantially. This is primarily regulated by hormonal signals, notably those from adrenaline and cortisol, which activate lipase enzymes responsible for hydrolyzing the fats. These enzymes split the triglycerides stored in adipose tissue, resulting in an increased level of free fatty acids in the blood, which are then available for oxidative metabolism in the muscles and other organs. The transportation of these fatty acids is also facilitated by specific proteins in the blood, such	1913	1998.5768
The visibility brackets in the left hand vertical column are chosen for convenience to seamen and airmen rather than to conform with available tables constructed primarily for Meteorologists. Limitations conform as closely as possible with standards utilised by United States Weather Bureau observers and with accepted international standards. Haze can be regarded as atmospheric pollution composed principally of very small salt crystals and dust particles which give dark objects a blue tinge and bright objects a yellow orange tinge. Haze seldom obscures objects at a distance less than a mile, but for practical purposes may be regarded as absent when visibility is over 20 miles. Thickest haze occurs over oceans and along coastal areas. Least haze is found in dry desert areas. The densest smoke pollution of the atmosphere occurs in and near industrial areas where large amounts of fuel are used to provide power to  233 operate factories.	Smoke, unlike haze, consists primarily of carbon particles and various chemical compounds resulting from incomplete combustion. This type of pollution not only reduces visibility but also poses significant health risks to the respiratory system. In urban environments, where factories, vehicles, and residential heating systems contribute to air pollution, smoke can significantly degrade air quality. Visibility can be reduced to less than a few hundred feet in severe cases, severely impacting both ground and air transport. Furthermore, the interaction between smoke and haze can exacerbate the reduction in visibility, especially under stagnant air conditions where pollutants are not readily dispersed by wind. Meteorologists and environmental scientists monitor these conditions closely using both ground-based observations and satellite technology to provide accurate forecasts and health advisories. For navigation purposes, both seamen and airmen must be acutely aware of the prevailing visibility conditions. Modern instrumentation and weather forecasting techniques have greatly aided in predicting and navigating through poor visibility scenarios, enhancing safety in both maritime and aerial operations.	1913	2005.3567
The details of the balance, the wind guard, and the attachments to the aerofoil will be found in Report No. 68, pages 61-71. This method of support ensures a miniaium of interference with the free passage of the air, whilst holding the model firmly in the required position, and allowing the angle of incidence to be set with great accuracy. Wind Speed. — The speed of the air in the channel was kept at 30 feet per second throughout all the experiments and was measured by the method described in Report No. 68, page 60. Observations Taken.	The observations taken during the experiments included measurements of lift and drag forces, as well as the angle of attack and the pressure distribution over the surface of the aerofoil. These measurements were conducted using a variety of instruments such as force balances, manometers, and pitot tubes, which were calibrated before each testing session to ensure accuracy. The lift and drag forces were recorded at several points along the aerofoil to assess the performance and stability of the design under different airspeeds and angles of incidence. The data collected was then plotted to create lift and drag curves, which are crucial for understanding the aerodynamic characteristics of the aerofoil. Additionally, high-speed cameras were used to visualize the flow around the aerofoil, particularly focusing on any formation of vortices or separation of the airflow, which could indicate potential issues with the design. Smoke and dye visualization techniques were also employed to provide a clearer picture of the flow patterns. Throughout the series of experiments, adjustments were made to refine the angle of incidence and the positioning of the aerofoil within the wind tunnel to optimize performance. Each	1912	1976.6055
Biologists and historians alike are puzzled by the fact that the world's great men have come in groups; the biologist is unable to find an adequate time for producing the necessary degree of variation, and the historian, with all his search for historical causes can do little more than record the fact. Perhaps the psychologist of childhood and adolescence may be allowed to suggest that a few tendencies he knows to exist in every child may have taken advantage of the alteration in the choking process to shoot up into fully formed plants. All of this is merely to emphasise the fact that civilization has by no means exhausted the possibilities of human nature, which may at any time under favourable conditions contribute to the historical succession, or even alter its course. It being granted that social filiation is inclusive of both historical succession and psychological adjustment, we may, with some degree of profit, examine the details exhibited in the process of adaptation.	This examination reveals that during periods of intense cultural and intellectual activity, often referred to as 'golden ages', there is a remarkable synchronization of societal conditions that favor the flourishing of talents. These conditions include economic stability, relative peace, and an openness to new ideas, which collectively create a fertile ground for intellectual and artistic expression. In such environments, individuals are not only encouraged but also supported to pursue their interests and develop their abilities to the fullest. Moreover, the clustering of great minds can often be attributed to a network effect, where innovators and thinkers feed off each other’s ideas and energy. This phenomenon can be seen in the intellectual salons of Enlightenment France, the coffee houses of 17th century England, and the universities of Renaissance Italy. Here, the exchange of ideas among contemporaries propelled not only individual achievements but also collective advancement in science, philosophy, and the arts. As such, the role of educational and cultural institutions cannot be understated. These institutions act as catalysts, bringing together diverse minds and providing them with the resources necessary to explore and expand upon their ideas. The nurturing of	1908	1995.1719
[the knd.] Ghosts BY FANNIE STEARNS DAVIS 1 AM almost afraid of the wind out there. * The dead leaves skip on the porches bare, The windows clatter and whine. I sit Here in the quiet house, low lit, With the clock that ticks and the books that stand, Wise and silent, on every hand. I am almost afraid; though I know the night Lets no ghosts walk in the warm lamplight. Yet ghosts there are; and they blow, they blow, Out in the wind and the scattering snow. — When I open the windows and go to bed, Will the ghosts come in and stand at my head ? Last night I dreamed they came back again. I heard them talking; I saw them plain. They hugged me and held me and loved me; spoke Of happy doings and friendly folk. They seemed to have journeyed a week away, But now they were ready and glad to stay.	They brought back laughter to rooms too still, Their voices echoed from wall to hill. Yet when I woke with the dawn's first light, The house was silent, the world was white. No footprints marred the snowy ground, No touch, no whisper, no sign they'd found Their way back home from wherever they roam, These ghosts of mine that had briefly come. Tonight, as the wind howls its mournful song, And shadows in corners grow tall and long, I ponder if dreams are the place they stay, Or if, in the wind, they've found their way. Will they slip through cracks, will they enter through doors, Float in on the breeze from some distant shores? I sit and I wait in this dim-lit room, Half in hope, half in gloom, For the ghosts that speak, for the ghosts that laugh, For a spectral touch, for a phantom's staff. For though they are ghosts, and the night is deep, They are mine to love, they are mine to keep.	1913	1979.4886

These have been given for various cases in Art. 163, and it is unnecessary to repeat them; for practical use the formulae for various cases may be reduced as shown in (6), Art.	164, where the solutions are presented in a form more immediately applicable to engineering problems. It is important to note that the relationship between whirling speeds and frequencies of transverse vibration is crucial in the design and analysis of rotating machinery. This relationship helps in predicting the critical speeds at which resonance may occur, potentially leading to catastrophic failures if not properly managed. For cylindrical shafts undergoing simple harmonic motion, the critical speed can be calculated using the formula derived in Art. 164, which incorporates factors such as the length of the shaft, the mass distribution, and the stiffness of the material. This formula ensures that engineers can design shafts and other rotating components with appropriate safety margins to avoid resonance at operating speeds. Furthermore, understanding the dynamics of rotating systems extends beyond merely avoiding resonance. It also encompasses optimizing performance by tuning the system to operate at speeds that minimize wear and energy consumption while maximizing output and efficiency. This holistic approach to design and analysis is what ultimately defines the success of mechanical systems in practical applications.	1908	1995.5609

Content smiled as Molly had described her smiling. She said nothing. The rector felt reproved and looked down upon from enormous heights of innocence and childhood and the wisdom thereof. However, he persisted. "" Content."" he said. "" what did you mean by telling your aunt Molly what you did ?"" "" I was talking with my big sister .Solly, "" replied Content, with the calmness of one stating a fundamental truth of nature. The rector's face grew stern. "" Content, "" he said. "" look at me.""

X 120 cm., and then through a short channel of the section stated. Speed measurements were made with a Pitot tube, calibrated in the open on the carriage. The surfaces tested were of CO cms. span, by 43'5 cms. in breadth; the longer dimension was parallel to the shorter dimension of the air stream. Hence the surfaces projected 15 cms. beyond the air stream on either side, and the conditions were essentially different from those obtaining in the case of an aeroplane wing in flight. Absolute values are therefore not given, but only a comparison of the results obtained for surfaces of different profile, with variation of the leading and trailing edges. 161. Dfaurain, Ch., et Toussaint, A. Etude de roues sustcntatrices (Bulletin de l'lnstitut Aerotechnique de 1 'University de Paris, Fascicule II., 1912). — A description of apparatus installed for testing lift or thrust producing machines of the paddle wheel type. The wheel is set at the end of a lever arm, and the force produced by it is ' weighed.'	The apparatus allows for adjustments in the angle of attack and rotational speed, thus facilitating a comprehensive analysis of performance across varying conditions. The study primarily focuses on the efficiency of the paddle wheel design, examining how modifications to blade shape and configuration impact the generated lift and thrust. The experimental setup includes a detailed measurement system that captures data on rotational speed, torque, and the resultant force exerted by the wheel. This data is then correlated with the aerodynamic characteristics of the blades, providing insights into the optimal configurations for specific applications. The results from Dfaurain and Toussaint's study indicate significant potential for improvements in paddle wheel designs, particularly in their application to aerodynamic lift and propulsion systems. By adjusting blade curvature and setting precise angles of attack, the researchers demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the efficiency of these systems substantially. These findings are expected to contribute to the development of more effective and efficient aerodynamic machines, potentially influencing future designs in aviation technology and other fields requiring precise control of fluid dynamics.	1912	2005.1898
We feel sure that this paper and discussion was most interesting and valuable to engineers of railway companies, and that the Illuminating Engineering Scciety will always be glad to cooperate with them in dealing with these problems in the future. LEON GASTER. 5 Review of Contents of this Issue. THE Technical Section opens with an article by CLAYTON H. SHARP and PRESTON S. MILLAR, in which they describe a new small model of their Universal Portable Photometer. The authors point out that it is an important principle, to be recognised in connexion with portable instruments, that although observational errors up to, say, 3 or 4 percent, may be permissible, there should be no inherent errors due to the construction of the instrument; and hence in designing this small model care has been taken to incorporate the essential features of the former model, so that there is only a loss of accuracy as far as the reading is concerned.	In the same section, an in-depth analysis is provided by ELIZABETH C. DAVIES on the evolving standards in street lighting. Her study correlates the improvement in public safety to the advancements in lighting technologies. She emphasizes the necessity for cities to adopt these new standards to enhance visibility and reduce accidents during nighttime. Following this, GEORGE R. SIMMONS discusses the challenges faced in the design of lighting for industrial environments. His paper focuses on achieving optimal illumination while minimizing energy consumption and addressing the specific needs of various industrial tasks. Simmons introduces several case studies where innovative lighting solutions have significantly improved worker productivity and safety. In another compelling article, THOMAS J. WATSON explores the impact of color temperature on work environments. Watson presents findings from recent experiments that demonstrate how different light temperatures can affect mood and cognitive functions. He suggests practical applications of this research in office settings to boost employee morale and efficiency. This issue also includes a review by MARTHA K. SMITH on the recent advancements in LED technology. Smith provides a comprehensive overview of how LEDs are being optimized for broader applications	1912	2005.2737

Well, see how it strikes you. As, then, I sat on this gate, there approached me up the lane a man of shabby genteel appearance, aged perhaps thirty, wearing a parson's hat above a countenance which, though cadaverous and grossly unshaven, undoubtedly presented signs of good birth, and accompanied by an extremely large and very rough looking sheep. It was the sheep — by no means a surprising object in a Devonshire lane — that attracted my interest: the sheep and the suggestion it somehow conveyed of accompanying, not of being in charge of, the man. Having regard to the man's story, the point is significant. The couple — the companions, as I prefer to put it — passed me side by side. A few paces beyond me the sheep turned toward the hedge and began to browse.	"The man, meanwhile, paused and looked about him with a weary expression, as if uncertain of his path or as if the simple act of walking had become a burden too great to bear. He noticed me then, and his face, for a moment, broke into a wan smile. ""Good day,"" he said, his voice surprisingly cultured for his disheveled appearance. ""I hope the afternoon finds you well?""  I nodded, still curious about the unusual pair. ""Quite well, thank you. And yourself? And your—friend?"" I gestured towards the sheep, which had now lifted its head from the hedge and was staring at us with an air of mild curiosity. ""Ah,"" the man sighed, running a hand through his unkempt hair. ""We've seen better days, both of us. This is Horatio, by the way. Not my sheep, you understand, but rather my companion, as you aptly noted."" ""Horatio,"" I repeated, amused. ""That’s an unusual name for a sheep."" ""Indeed,"" he agreed, with a ghost"	1913	1922.2124
An illustration is given in the list of a sign in script letters, which is controlled by a motor flasher, giving the effect of writing the words. Mazda Lamps in Music Halls. Nowadays a music hall, if it is to retain its patronage, must be not merely adequately, but brilliantly lighted. The introduction of the metal filament lamp made it possible to do this without increasing the consumption of electricity. But the ordinary metal lamp with pressed filament was too fragile for use in battens and footlights, and consequently carbon lamps had to be retained in these positions. The Mazda drawn wire lamp has now removed even this limitation, and Mazda lamps are used throughout some thousands of theatres in all parts of the world. A certain theatre has 400 40 watt Mazdas in use as stage border lights, footlights, and sidelights.	The result is a dazzling spectacle of brilliance and clarity that enhances every performance, making the colours of costumes and sets pop vividly against the luminous background. The uniformity of the light, along with its ability to dim smoothly, allows for subtle mood transitions and dramatic effects that were difficult to achieve with older lighting technologies. Furthermore, the durability of Mazda lamps ensures that they can withstand the frequent changes and physical demands of theatre productions. This reliability, combined with their energy efficiency, makes them a cost-effective solution for theatre managers, who see a noticeable reduction in both maintenance and electricity costs. The adaptability of these lamps is also notable. They can be fitted into existing lighting fixtures with minimal adjustments, making the transition to Mazda lamps straightforward for most theatres. This ease of integration, combined with their superior performance, has led to their rapid adoption across the entertainment industry. Additionally, the safety of Mazda lamps, with their lower heat emission compared to carbon lamps, significantly reduces the risk of fire hazards, which is a critical consideration in the densely packed and flammable environments of stage settings. This safety feature alone	1912	1999.5542
"The island of Cuba exhibits the curious spectacle of a tropical land which is peculiarly fitted to be the home of a coloured race, but which is for the time being swinging towards a decisive white majority. After 1898 it seemed that Cuba was to follow the steps of Haiti and become a black republic, but immediately after the war of liberation there set in ""Pearson, ""National Life and Character, "" pp. 1&-17.

The final limit for deporting the contract labourers was fixed for December 31, 1906."	a significant influx of Spanish and other European immigrants who dramatically shifted the demographic balance. The new government's policies, influenced by the American presence and the global sentiments of the time, favored these European settlers and entrepreneurs who began to establish extensive agricultural and commercial enterprises on the island. This shift was not just demographic but also socio-economic. The sugar industry, which had been the backbone of the Cuban economy, saw a transformation as these new landowners introduced modern farming techniques and equipment, further entrenching the economic power of the white minority. At the same time, the native and African-descended populations found themselves increasingly marginalized, both politically and economically, often relegated to the poorest lands or to urban slums. Despite these challenges, the cultural influence of the African and indigenous populations remained strong, contributing to the rich tapestry of Cuban culture seen in its music, art, and religious practices. However, the political power remained firmly in the hands of the white elite, who controlled the levers of government and the lucrative export trades. As Cuba moved into the 20th century, the question of race and class	1911	1995.6871
"But the American woman as depicted in the English novel, especially in that of the minor English novelist, uses the most extraordinary conglomeration of words and phrases that was ever raked together from the highways and byways of colloquial speech. As represented there, she is linguistically one of the most fearful and wonderful creations that the human imagination has ever concocted. She combines in her utterance all the time worn peculiarities which the British traveller long ago discovered and faithfully reported to his countrymen. Necessarily she speaks through her nose. Certain words and phrases are constantly on her lips. She "" guesses "" and "" fixes "" to an extent that would astound those most addicted to the use of the words. She is fond of saying "" jest lovely, "" "" jest elegant."""	In addition, she liberally sprinkles her conversations with “I reckon,” “right away,” and “you bet,” phrases which, though used in parts of the United States, are attributed to her in such abundance and with such indiscriminate frequency that one would assume she knows no others. Moreover, her grammar is a fantastical mishmash of errors and her syntax is relentlessly tangled, a deliberate caricature framed to underscore her supposed lack of education and refinement. This portrayal, while perhaps amusing to an uninformed audience, does a great disservice to the nuanced and diverse linguistic landscape of America.  It ignores the rich regional dialects and the educated discourse prevalent among countless American women. Instead, it clings to an outdated and exaggerated stereotype that serves only to reinforce old prejudices and misunderstandings. The American woman, in reality, is as capable of articulate and eloquent speech as any of her British counterparts, and to suggest otherwise is to indulge in a fiction that is both misleading and unnecessarily derogatory.	1913	1989.1185
Equation (8), which may be written — y = h or i or a a -2 . . (10) w 01 shows that if w remains nearly equal to the critical value the deflection, and therefore the intensity of stress, may be unduly great. Effect of Size of Load. — If the rotating load were not of small dimensions in comparison with the length of the shaft, it would be necessary to take account of the fact that, owing to the deflection of the shaft, every portion of the rotating weight is constantly changing its plane of rotation. (An important exception occurs in the case of a single load placed midway between similar bearings.) The more exact values in such cases, as well as much information on the subject of Whirling of Shafts, is to be found in papers by Professor Dunkerley1 and Dr. Chree.2 Several Loads. — When a shaft carries several loads, the critical speeds of rotation may be found by the empirical formula (8) of Art.	icle 17, which states that the critical speed, \( n_c \), is calculated by the formula: \[ n_c = \frac{k}{\sqrt{\sum \frac{W_i}{y_i}}} \] where \( W_i \) represents each individual load on the shaft, \( y_i \) the deflection at each load due to the weight \( W_i \), and \( k \) a constant depending on the material and dimensions of the shaft. It is crucial to note that the deflections, \( y_i \), must be calculated considering the combined effect of all loads, not just the load at the point of interest. This is because the deflection at any point on the shaft affects, and is affected by, the loads at all other points along the shaft. The process of calculating these deflections involves solving the beam equation for the shaft, typically modeled as a simply supported beam under multiple point loads. The beam equation, given by: \[ EI \frac{d^4 y}{dx^4} = q(x) \] where	1908	1974.1246

"Lady William acquiesced in silence. She, too, strongly disapproved of Lady Coryston's action toward her eldest son, abominable as Coryston's opinions were. Women, like minorities, must suffer; and she was glad to have her husband's word for it that it is not their business to correct or coerce their eldest sons, on the ground of political opinions, however grievous those opinions may be. 380 "" I trust that Lady Coryston will not open on this subject to me, "" said Lord William after a pause. "" I am never good at concealing my opinions for politeness' sake. And of course I hold that Coryston is just as much in the wrong as she. And mad to boot!

There are weird sections of ancient walls whose courses still bear the imprint of vanished hands, and queer insights into basements and sub basements, into vaults and dingy corners. A titanic shearing away is this, a procession of exposure, ruthless and insistent, as if some inflexible hand had torn away the coverings behind which men had been hiding for years and revealed a thousand vital processes that were secretly sustaining all the visible evidences of life overhead. There were suggestions of murder and mystery, of engine rooms and reeking sweatshops. One could peer through gaps in the masonry and see the submerged tenth toiling in speechless haste, oblivious to the coming of the subway and to everything except the pressure of a grim necessity. There were contrasts unending between these buried, grimy, airless chambers and the tall, shining structures that sprang skyward from their unlovely depths.	Such contrasts spoke volumes about the city's layered life, where the sunlit avenues above belied the shadowed struggles beneath. It was a city of paradoxes, where the gleam of prosperity was underpinned by a labyrinth of toil and hardship. As the excavation for the subway progressed, it was as though history itself was being unearthed, layer by layer. The old foundations—some crumbling, others stubbornly resilient—were testimonies to past epochs, each stone a silent witness to the myriad lives that had pulsated above and within these confines. The air was thick with dust and the echo of hammers and pickaxes, a symphony of destruction that paved the way for creation. Workers, their faces smeared with grime, moved through these subterranean catacombs with a purposeful urgency, their labor a necessary sacrifice on the altar of progress. Above them, the city hummed oblivious, its inhabitants caught in the daily ballet of commerce and survival, unaware of the monumental transformation occurring beneath their hurried steps. In this underworld, every exposed pipe and cable, every	1913	2002.7645
He bowed them all out with great ceremony and a very remote manner. M'sai Uganda had edged behind him in the neighbourhood of the kerosene tins, upon a pretext of shaking hands, which custom he had learned in the mission. But Bell inger, prompted by a hunter's dislike of anything at his back, turning suddenly, the black fingers were quickly withdrawn from a gorged tin whose dollars apparently adhered to M'sai's long, thieving hand. Bellinger slapped it heartily, and the dollars fell into the tin again, while M'sai, unabashed, and abstracted as one immersed in high thought, departed with his women, after profuse farewells. The overflow audience soon surged up to the compound, and five concerts were given to other packed houses before Christmas was past.	Bellinger, meanwhile, kept a watchful eye on the festive crowds, his earlier encounter with M'sai leaving him slightly wary of the exuberance that often accompanies such gatherings. Despite the jovial atmosphere, his instincts as a hunter kept him alert to any undercurrents of mischief or theft that might arise amidst the celebrations. The concerts themselves were a grand success, drawing not only the local population but also curious visitors from neighboring villages. The air was filled with the sound of traditional drums, the melodic strumming of the kora, and the robust singing of the choir, which had practiced for weeks under the starlit sky. Bellinger, though always on guard, couldn't help but be moved by the communal spirit that these musical evenings evoked. As the final notes of the last concert faded into the night, the community felt a collective satisfaction, a feeling of unity and joy that only such shared experiences can bring. Bellinger, standing at the back of the crowd, allowed himself a rare smile, appreciating the simple pleasure of music and its power to bring people together	1913	1960.8759
These were of similar type, with the same lengths and total volume, but the litter had a perfectly Hat bottom line as far as the round up to the stem, and it proved the more efficient of the two, as will be seen from the E HP. curves. (See Fig. 10, Plate 7.) The sides of all the models were made so that they formed straight lines in every cross section. This was done with a view to simplicity of construction. The earlier models had vertical sides, but with models b2 onwards, the sides were flared in various ways.	The flaring of the sides, while complicating the construction slightly, was found to have significant advantages in terms of stability and speed. The increased beam at the waterline not only improved the initial stability but also allowed for a smoother ride in choppy conditions. The modifications in the hull design were reflected in the performance data collected during the trials. Each iteration of the model showed a gradual improvement in efficiency, demonstrating the benefits of adjusting the hull's geometry. The effectiveness of these design changes was particularly evident when comparing the resistance and propulsion efficiency between the models with vertical sides and those with flared sides. The latter showed a noticeable reduction in drag, which corresponds to a higher speed at the same power output, or conversely, lower power consumption at the same speed. This was quantified in the enhanced EHP curves, which clearly favored the models with flared sides. Further refinements included adjustments to the bow and stern shapes, optimizing them for better wave-piercing capabilities and reducing wake turbulence. These changes, while subtle, contributed to the overall hydrodynamic efficiency of the models. As a result	1912	1987.9261
"The physiological limitations will doubtless increase as children grow up who could not be born naturally or be nursed naturally or live through the harsher conditions that formerly obtained. The economic and social causes — the increase and wider diffusion of wealth, prudence and knowledge — will almost surely become more potent. Dr. Bertillon discusses in detail the causes of the depopulation of France and the measures which he recommends to arrest it. The latter are indeed feeble in comparison with the former, and he puts on his title page the pessimistic motto ""Tl n'est pas besoin VOL. lxxix. — 42. d 'esperer pour entrependre ni de reus sir pour perseverer.'' Apart from a moral regeneration leading people to want to do what they can rather than to get what they can, the remedy is in the direction recommended in the book, but requires far more radical measures."	These measures might include comprehensive family support programs, incentives for childbearing, and a reevaluation of work-life balance policies to make parenting less daunting financially and socially. Dr. Bertillon suggests that a shift in societal values towards family and community life, coupled with government policies that support those values, could help reverse the trend of depopulation. Furthermore, the implementation of educational campaigns that address the benefits of larger families and the joys of parenting could also play a crucial role. Public policies that reduce the cost of child-rearing—such as subsidies for childcare, education, and healthcare—would remove significant barriers that currently deter many from starting or expanding their families. Equally important is the need to create environments that are conducive to raising children. This includes not only economic and financial support but also the development of safer, more engaging community spaces that enhance the quality of life for both children and their parents. Ultimately, Dr. Bertillon argues, the issue of depopulation must be tackled not only through direct interventions aimed at increasing birth rates but also by cultivating a culture that values and supports family life at its	1911	2007.3553
THE GREATEST FORGERY IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY By Louis F. Post LESS than three weeks before the Presidential election of 1880, and on a Monday night in October, the once notorious but now almost forgotten Morey letter first came under my eye. I had been conversing with the city editor of Truth, a penny daily of New York City with which I was then connected as an editorial writer and part owner, when the managing editor passed through the reporters' room where we were sitting. He was on his way to the editorial room adjoining, in which, a few minutes before, I had left the principal proprietor, Mr. Joseph Hart, seated at his desk. These rooms were in the rear of the north side basement of the Morse Building, on Nassau Street, directly opposite the old Potter Building in which the World was published, and diagonally opposite the old Times building.	"As the managing editor disappeared into the next room, I heard the faint rustle of papers and a low murmur of voices, indicating that a discussion of some import was underway. Curiosity piqued, I excused myself from the city editor and made my way to the editorial room. Mr. Hart looked up as I entered, his face etched with lines of concern and intrigue. ""Louis,"" he beckoned me closer, pushing a crumpled piece of paper across the desk towards me. ""Take a look at this. It was just brought in by one of our runners from the Republican headquarters."" I smoothed out the paper, my eyes scanning the handwritten text. It was a letter, purportedly from James A. Garfield, the Republican presidential candidate, expressing support for the controversial Chinese Exclusion Act. The language was politically explosive, certain to stir significant outrage among the labor communities and immigrant populations which were vehemently opposed to such legislation. ""This could change the course of the election,"" I murmured, aware of the weight the document held. ""Yes, but we need to"	1911	1956.2069
"16. Broussaisism, so-called ""physiological medicine, "" founded by Broussais (1772 — 1838) of France, and in vogue for a decade or two from about 1816, which looked upon gastro enteric inflammation and irritation as the cause of diseases in general. Thus the history of internal medicine shows a succession of ephemeral systems and theories from Hippocrates down to about the second quarter of the nineteenth century. In the various systems that developed a few factors stand out prominently around which the theories centred."	One of these factors was the concept of humoral pathology, which posited that health was maintained by a balance of the four bodily humors: blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. An imbalance among these humors was thought to cause disease. This theory, dominant in ancient Greek medicine, was upheld by Hippocrates and later by Galen, and it persisted well into the 17th century. Another influential theory was solidism, which shifted focus from the fluids of the body to its solid parts. Solidism emphasized the role of organs, tissues, and fibers in the pathology of disease. This theory gained prominence in the 18th century and was notably advanced by the anatomists of the period who were able to provide detailed descriptions of the body's structure. The rise of cellular pathology in the 19th century marked another pivotal shift. Promulgated by Rudolf Virchow, this theory proposed that diseases arose not in organs or tissues per se, but at a more granular level—in the cells themselves. According to Virchow, every disease involved some	1911	1989.4966
"Whenever the number three hundred appeared it was symbolical of the cross; for example, in the age of Enoch or in the length of the ark."" For, according to Bede, following the traditions of the Fathers, ' This number is customarily represented among the Greeks by the letter T. The letter 'Bede 8. 37. 'Ibid. 4. 376 {Lives of Holy Abbots). 'Ibid. 11. 278. 'Ibid. 8. 100. 'Ibid. 'Ibid. 9. 15. 'Ibid."	T, which in the Greek alphabet is called tau, resembles the shape of the cross upon which our Lord was crucified. Thus, when we see the tau or the number three hundred, it serves as a reminder of the sacrifice and the redemption that came through the cross.' Moreover, this symbolism extends further in Christian iconography and liturgy. The use of the tau cross in the vestments of priests and in church decorations underscores its importance as a symbol of faith and redemption. In the manuscripts and artistic depictions from the early Christian period, the tau is often adorned with jewels or rendered in a stylized form to emphasize its significance. This adoption of the tau as a symbol of the cross illustrates the deep layers of meaning found within Christian symbolism, where numbers, letters, and shapes converge to convey rich theological truths.	1904	1972.6486

"Even in the tropical regions, although it is hot, it is not the oppressive and enervating heat that I have experienced in the tropics on our own world."" He then remarked that "" He knew the planets all moved through space and had read that some of the stars did too, and he would like to know whether our sun had any motion in space ? "" "" Yes, "" I replied ; "" as the result of a long series of observations and calculations it has been determined that the sun is moving through space and carrying with it all the planets in our system. Its rate of movement is not known with certainty, but it is estimated at about 1,000,000 miles a day."	"This motion carries it in the direction of a point in the constellation of Hercules. This vast journey through space is part of what astronomers refer to as the solar system's orbit within the Milky Way galaxy. Each star, much like our sun, follows its own path, influenced by the gravitational forces of nearby stars and galactic structures. This cosmic dance is intricate and spans scales that are almost beyond human comprehension."" He nodded thoughtfully, absorbing the enormity of the concept. ""So, our entire solar system is just a tiny speck moving through the universe? That's both humbling and fascinating."" ""Indeed,"" I agreed. ""It puts into perspective how vast the universe is and how interconnected everything is through the forces of gravity and motion. Despite the immense distances and scales, the principles of physics apply universally."" He looked up at the sky, now viewing the stars with a new sense of understanding and wonder. ""It's incredible to think about all the movements happening in space that we're completely unaware of in our daily lives."" ""Yes,"" I said, ""and each of those stars could have"	1911	2006.8619
"The issue which determined the selection of a Democratic governor in this overwhelmingly Republican state was not national, such as a revolt against the Pain aldrich tariff bill. It was not even partizan. It was ""Assemblyism."" And 'Assemblyism"" meant to the voters of Oregon a well planned, powerfully organised attempt on the part of the old bi partizan machine, which once ruled the state, to overthrow the whole ""system"" established by the people, and especially the direct election of United States Senators by the famous Statement Number One method. The Hon. Jay Bowerman, the Republican candidate for governor, when president of the State Senate had favoured and voted for this proposed ""Assembly plan, "" which was little more than the old convention system of nominations under a new name."	"The plan, if implemented, would have effectively stripped the electorate of their recently gained power to directly influence senatorial elections, reverting back to a less transparent and more manipulable system. This sparked a fierce backlash among voters who saw it as a direct attack on the democratic reforms that had been hard-fought in previous years. The Democratic challenger, Oswald West, capitalized on this sentiment, campaigning vigorously against the ""Assembly plan"" and positioning himself as a defender of direct democracy and the people’s rights. West's campaign resonated deeply with Oregonians who were proud of their progressive achievements and wary of any regression. His message was clear: electing him meant safeguarding the direct election system and ensuring that the government remained accountable to the people, not just a political machine. This stance, coupled with a widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo, galvanized a broad coalition of voters, including many who traditionally voted Republican but felt betrayed by Bowerman’s support for the ""Assembly plan."" On election day, the results were a clear repudiation of ""Assemblyism"" and a victory for the advocates"	1911	2006.9583
The reference line in the model is the centre line of the boom supporting the tail. (2) Measurements of longitudinal force, lateral force, yawins; moment and rolling moment, for varying angles of yaw from — 25° to + 25°. All the moments are given about axes through the C.G. of the machine. The position of the C.G. relative to the model is indicated in Fig. 17. The results are shown in Tables 10 to 13, and in the curves (Figs.	18 to 21). Each figure represents a different set of forces and moments as functions of yaw angle. It can be observed that the longitudinal force generally increases with positive yaw, indicating a more aggressive aerodynamic behavior when the machine faces the wind from certain angles. The lateral forces show a tendency to stabilize after reaching a peak at around ±15° yaw, suggesting that the machine has inherent stability characteristics that resist excessive side forces beyond these points. Rolling moments and yawing moments exhibit a symmetrical pattern about the zero yaw angle, reflecting the aerodynamic balance of the machine under symmetrical wind conditions. Particularly, the rolling moment curve (Fig. 20) demonstrates a sharp increase as the yaw angle moves away from zero, peaking near ±25°, before gradually tapering off. This indicates a strong rolling response at high yaw angles, which could be critical for the machine's maneuverability and stability during sharp turns or in turbulent conditions. The yawing moment curve (Fig. 21) similarly shows an increase with the yaw angle but with a more moderate slope compared to the rolling moment.	1912	2004.0997

The issue at stake in these cases typically revolves around the interpretation of contractual obligations and the enforcement of rights under such agreements. In Judy v. Louderman, the court was faced with a dispute involving the terms of a lease agreement, where one party claimed that the other had failed to adhere to the stipulated conditions, thus breaching the contract. This led to a broader discussion on the nature of contractual duties and the expectations that should be reasonably held by each party involved in such agreements. In Brownlee o. Low, the contention centered around the interpretation of property rights and the obligations arising from property transactions. The decision in this case emphasized the importance of clear communication and explicit terms in property dealings to prevent misunderstandings and subsequent legal disputes. The legal principles derived from these cases have significant implications for both the theory and practice of contract law. They underscore the necessity for precise drafting of contracts and the careful delineation of rights and responsibilities within those documents. Furthermore, these cases highlight the role of the judiciary in interpreting contractual clauses and ensuring that justice is	1913	1989.0347
"If medicine had made the great progress it is credited with these percentages could have been reduced in the past hundred years. They have not been materially lessened in that time. Instead of patiently searching for the cure of disease, the profession has been led off into a quagmire of commercialism by surgery, not because it was anything more than it has always been, a mechanical removal of the products of disease, not the curing of the same, nor its prevention — as old Valentine Mott, the most famous surgeon of his day in America, said: ""Surgery is the opprobrium of Medicine"" — but because ""it paid best"" and was an apparent demonstration to the patient of objective and merely mechanical skill."	The true physician's calling, however, should not be swayed by the lure of financial gain, but driven by the quest for genuine healing. The focus needs to shift back to the fundamentals of medicine—understanding the root causes of diseases and developing methods not just to treat symptoms, but to prevent ailments and promote overall health. The emphasis on preventive medicine, though gaining ground, is still far too overshadowed by the immediacy and spectacle of surgical interventions. This approach requires a deeper engagement with the patient, a thorough understanding of their environment, lifestyle, genetics, and a multitude of other factors that contribute to their health. It calls for an integration of various disciplines within medicine and beyond—nutrition, psychology, social sciences—to develop a holistic approach to health care. Moreover, the advancement in medical research needs to be democratized. The knowledge and innovations should not be confined to the echelons of high-paying patients but should permeate to all levels of society. Public health initiatives should be strengthened, and education on health maintenance should be widespread, aiming to empower individuals with the knowledge and means to take	1911	2004.1008
What is Joy? Who knows? What each does know is that when he is joyous a pulse beats somewhere which creates and sets free an additional energy. In joy he realises an overwash of vitality, which permeates his whole being with an accession of new life. In joy, the meanest reaches an O Altitude. Its heights may not be high, but its realisation represents an expanding impulse. To how many will the beat of a drum seat the heart pulsating to a quicker vibration, and square the shoulders with an increased vitality.	Joy, in its essence, is a profound and often sudden sensation of completeness, a fulfillment that transcends the ordinary boundaries set by the mundane aspects of life. It is as if, in those moments, the soul glimpses its potential and feels momentarily aligned with the infinite possibilities of existence. This alignment brings about a lightness of being, a feeling as though one could soar above the trivial concerns that typically weigh down the spirit. In joy, there is a sense of unity—with oneself, with others, and with the universe at large. It often comes unbidden, breaking through the cracks of everyday routine with the suddenness of a flower blooming in an unexpected place. It is both a recognition and a revelation, revealing not just what is, but what could be. Joy can manifest in myriad forms: the laughter of a child, the satisfaction of a job well done, the awe of a breathtaking view, or the warmth of genuine connection. Each instance is a note in the symphony of existence, a reminder that life, despite its inevitable challenges, is fundamentally beautiful. Moreover, joy is	1911	1997.2023
Euston Station had shared the same fate as St. Pancras, and was blazing furiously, sending up a great column of black smoke that could be seen by all London. So many were the conflagrations now breaking out that it seemed as though the enemy were sending into London shells filled with petrol, in order to set the streets aflame. This, indeed, was proved by an eyewitness, who saw a shell fall in Liverpool Road, close to the Angel. It burst with a bright red flash, and next second the whole  of the roadway and neighbouring houses were blazing furiously. Thus the air became black with smoke and dust, and the light of day obscured in Northern London. And through that obscurity came those whizzing shells in an incessant hissing stream, each one, bursting in these narrow, thickly populated stieets, causing havoc indescribable, and a loss of life impossible to accurately calculate.	Amidst the chaos, the sounds of sirens were incessant, merging with the cries of the wounded and the shouts of firefighters struggling to combat the rapidly spreading fires. The streets, once bustling with the everyday life of Londoners, were now strewn with debris and echoing with the roar of flames consuming century-old buildings. Volunteers and emergency responders darted through the smoke, dragging hoses and directing crowds away from the danger zones. The hospitals, already overwhelmed, faced an influx of burn victims and trauma cases. Makeshift medical stations were set up in less affected areas, staffed by doctors, nurses, and anyone with medical training. The community rallied together, providing blankets, food, and comfort to those displaced or injured. As night fell, the skyline of North London was a silhouette against a backdrop of fire-lit smoke, the air thick with the smell of burning timber and asphalt. Despite the destruction, the spirit of London remained unbroken, with tales of heroism and resilience emerging from the rubble. Neighbors helped one another search for missing loved ones, and shelters filled with donations from	1906	2006.9523
"The court has recognised the fact that a man sitting down on top of a car could not strike his head against an overhead bridge that was 4 feet 7 inches above the top of the car, for such a man would have to have been 9 feet high, which was never known; "" that a person with an artificial. leg can stand; "" that whisky, apple~brandy, and a whisky cocktail are intoxicating; I5 that kerosene is inﬂammable, “but not that it is refined coal oil or earth oil."" These examples are sufficient to show what the courts may take judicial notice of, but there can be no certainty that they will do so. The expert must be prepared to prove anything and everything necessary to the elucidation and explanation of the truth, and, if necessary, by practical example. All courts have not had the same experience and training and cannot, therefore, be equally well informed. One might know less of cocktails and applejack and more of coal oil and kerosene, while another might have lived in many districts of this country and never have seen the common crude petroleum, or coal oil. 293- Right to Use Models and Make Tests Rests with Trial Court. — - While illustrations bearing more directly upon engineering are the use of 1Canavan 21. Stuyvesant, 27 N. Y. Supp. Iowa 185. 413. ""Globe Printing Co. v. Stohl, 23 Mo. 9 North Chicago St. R. CO. 17. Cheetham, App. 451. . 58 Ill. App 318, ' I’ Luke 1)."	New York Central R. R., 74 N.Y. 402, it has been recognized that the trial court has the discretion to allow the use of models and to conduct tests in the courtroom if deemed necessary to aid in understanding the technical aspects of the case. However, this discretion must be exercised judiciously, ensuring that such demonstrations do not prejudice the jury or unduly influence the proceedings. The use of models or conducting tests is often pivotal in cases involving complex mechanical devices or processes, where verbal descriptions alone might fail to convey the necessary clarity. Models and tests can serve to illuminate facts that might otherwise remain obscure or abstract to those unfamiliar with the specific field of expertise. For instance, in a patent infringement case, a working model of the disputed invention might be demonstrated to show how the mechanism operates, thereby making the issue of whether there has been an infringement more comprehensible to the jury. Similarly, in a civil engineering dispute concerning the stability of a structure, a scale model subjected to simulated stress tests can visually represent the contention in question. The courts have generally upheld the use of such demonstr	1913	1977.725
A simple experiment will illustrate this point. In Figure 27, a horizontal bar S s has attached to its middle and ends four parcels of air. Each parcel is tied to the bar by a very thin and practically weightless cord. Parcel A is warmer than the air parcels surrounding it; parcels B and C are of the same temperature; parcel D is colder than surrounding parcels. Parcel A, being warmer and of less weight than surrounding parcels, rises until it pulls on the cord; parcels B and C, being equal in temperature and weight to their environment, remain at rest near the bar; parcel D, being colder and heavier than its surround  Figure 28. Samples of stable air in which the free air temperature curve lies to right of curve for rising unsaturated parcels.	This arrangement demonstrates the principle of buoyancy in the atmosphere. The warmer air in parcel A expands and becomes less dense, causing it to rise compared to the cooler, denser air around it. This is a fundamental concept in meteorology, explaining phenomena such as convection currents which are crucial for weather patterns and cloud formation. Conversely, the colder air in parcel D contracts and becomes denser, making it sink. This is indicative of stable conditions in the atmosphere, where cooler air stays below warmer air, reducing the likelihood of atmospheric turbulence or convection. Parcels B and C, being neutrally buoyant, do not rise or fall but maintain their position relative to the bar. This stability occurs when the environmental lapse rate (the rate at which air temperature decreases with altitude) is equal to the adiabatic lapse rates of the air parcels. In such scenarios, the air is neither prone to rising and forming clouds nor sinking and creating clear skies, leading to what is typically a calm weather condition. These principles are essential for understanding vertical movements within the atmosphere and their implications for	1913	2003.739

So runs the circular issued by the University of London making known the existence and advantages of its new Course in "" Home Science and Economics."" Proceeding further with the circular, "" The new grouping of studies within these Courses includes in a Three Years' Course, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Hygiene, Physiology, Household Work (ie., Cookery, Laundry and Housewifery), Economics (including bookkeeping and Business Affairs), Ethics and Psychology."" Still following the circular, "" The organisation of these Courses is the outcome of a strong wave of public opinion."""	This opinion recognizes the profound importance of domestic management and the need for its scientific study as a discipline worthy of academic recognition and rigor. The Course aims not only to equip women with the practical skills necessary for effective home management but also to elevate the status of these activities, acknowledging them as critical components of societal well-being. The University hopes that by providing a structured and scholarly approach to these subjects, it will foster a new generation of women who are not only adept at managing household duties but also capable of contributing to discussions on public health, education, and community planning. The curriculum is designed to bridge the gap between traditional gender roles and modern academic disciplines, offering a comprehensive education that empowers women in both their personal and public lives. Moreover, the inclusion of Ethics and Psychology is intended to provide students with a deeper understanding of the human aspects of home management, encouraging a thoughtful and compassionate approach to both family life and broader social interactions. This holistic approach underlines the University's commitment to producing graduates who are well-rounded, informed, and ready to make meaningful contributions to society.	1911	2005.7356
Oxalic acid was found at the same time, so probably the dicarboxylic moiety was attacked in the reaction. In the liver of the pig, therefore, an oleic acid occurs, differing from the common one, which is found, as Hartley showed, in the connective tissue of the pig, in having its unsaturated linkage between the sixth and seventh carbon atoms, reckoning from the unoxidised end of the molecule. Reference will be made to the probable significance of this observation later. Gadoleic acid, C20H^O^ occurs as glyceride in cod liver oil, in herring oil and in sperm oil (Bull). On oxidation with permanganate in the cold it yields a dioxy acid, crystallising out of alcohol with the melting point, 127-5° to 128°. Erucic acid, CMH42O2, [CH3(CHS)7. CH : CH(CH2)n. COOL], occurs as glyceride in colza oil, mustard seed oil or other vegetable oil.	The structural peculiarity of erucic acid, which distinguishes it from other common fatty acids, is the presence of a long hydrocarbon chain and a single double bond located unusually distant from the carboxyl group. This unique structure provides different physical and chemical characteristics compared to shorter chain fatty acids or those with double bonds closer to the functional group.  When erucic acid is subjected to hydrogenation, it converts to behenic acid, a saturated fatty acid with the same number of carbon atoms but without the double bond, which significantly alters its melting point and its interaction with other molecular entities. This process is essential in the industrial modification of vegetable oils for various applications, including the production of margarine and other food products where solid fats are required. Further study on the oxidation products of erucic acid, similar to those of gadoleic acid, could reveal more about its potential utility or toxicity, which is a current area of investigation in food science due to concerns about the effects of erucic acid on human health when consumed in large quantities.	1913	2003.8346

The bank considered well, and granted the loan for a year, with possible renewal. Since the current interest, four percent, at the time, was three percent, less than the rate he was paying, it seemed reasonably certain he could reestablish himself. Their faith was justified. He repaid the first loan after one renewal, and was therefore given another when for obviously good employment he needed it. It has taken him some years, but he has reduced the mortgage largely and has now a very good financial standing. Alt Kemnitz has its characteristic difference in its use of funds. They deal more largely in agricultural machinery. The bank in its earlier years purchased a steam thresher operated by a donkey engine, the cost of which was repaid by a charge for its use.	This model of financing proved to be quite beneficial for the local farmers who, lacking the capital to invest in such expensive machinery, could still benefit from its use on a pay-per-use basis. It also established a steady stream of income for the bank, which helped to stabilize its financial position and enabled it to extend further services and loans to the community. The success of this initiative led to further investments in agricultural technology, including modern ploughs and irrigation systems, which further supported the local economy and enhanced the productivity of the agricultural sector. The bank, recognizing the importance of sustainable practices, also facilitated workshops and training sessions on the best agricultural practices, ensuring that the advancements in technology were matched with the necessary skills and knowledge. As the years passed, the bank's role in the community grew beyond just a financial institution to a pivotal supporter of local development and innovation. This not only helped to improve the economic standing of Alt Kemnitz but also fostered a strong sense of community and mutual reliance among its residents. The bank continued to adapt and expand its services, always with an eye toward the unique needs	1913	1989.9865
mccoy showed that the single young is brought forth alive, being as much as o inches long at birth. Genus Tiliqua. Five species of blue tougued Lizards are known from Australia, while the other species is found in Java, the Moluccas, and New Guinea. They are all large lizards with large heads, long bodies and tails, and short legs. The scales are moderately large and smooth. They are met with on the ground, and are usually easily captured, though on a hot sunny day, if warned in time, one must run very quickly to overtake them before they reach cover. They live easily in captivity, and will lap  247 milk from a saucer with the prussian blue tongue just as does a cat. Like so many of the lizards they are liable to be infested with ticks, especially about the ear opening.	Their diet in captivity can be quite varied, including fruits, vegetables, and small amounts of meat, but they show a particular fondness for snails and other small invertebrates, which form a significant part of their natural diet. The blue tongue, a striking feature for which the genus is named, is thought to serve a defensive purpose. When threatened, the lizard will open its mouth wide to display the vividly colored tongue, possibly to startle predators and give it a chance to escape. In the wild, Tiliqua species are often found in a variety of habitats ranging from dry, arid regions to more temperate forest areas. They are ground dwellers, using their strong limbs to burrow into loose soil where they can hide from predators and extreme weather conditions. During cooler parts of the day, they can frequently be seen basking on sunlit patches to regulate their body temperature. Reproduction in Tiliqua involves ovoviviparity, where eggs develop inside the female and the young are born fully formed. This method of reproduction, quite unusual among lizards, gives	1909	1997.4572
Peter rose suddenly, in compliance with a nature that met emergencies on its feet, and stared down at her in slow wondering. She was very lovely. It was a still, white and gold loveliness which had charmed him like a bird from the bush; she had been an utter marvel to him, a cool white rose of a marvel, and his blood had quickened at the dream of what might be in that rose's heart when once she had unfolded it to her lover. At the present moment he was not caring a hang what was in that rose's heart. He didn't believe that there was a heart there — only fold on fold of cool white petals. There was no secret behind that still sweetness of hers. She was as flat as a painted fan. She was as unfeeling as a sawdust doll.	Yet, as he looked at her more intently, a flicker of doubt crossed his mind. Could anyone so exquisitely formed truly lack all depth, all inner warmth? Was it possible that beneath the serene exterior there lay no hidden fires, no complexities of soul waiting to be awakened? Peter's heart, despite his current disillusionment, held a corner of hope that perhaps he was wrong, that perhaps there was more to her than met his jaded eyes. He remembered the first time they had met, how her laughter had seemed like music spilling over a quiet brook, how her eyes had sparkled with a light that suggested depths unplumbed. Had that all been mere illusion, a trick of the light, a façade as carefully constructed as her impeccable appearance? With a sigh, Peter turned away from the window where she stood, bathed in the golden afternoon light that seemed to adore her as much as he once had. He felt a strange pang—a mixture of resentment and an inexplicable longing. He wanted to dismiss her, to label her as shallow and move on	1913	1979.7848
a smaller values of about , V for pin ends and — for flat ends. For 64E r 100E / values of g beyond the point of tangency with Euler's curve, Euler's values of /„ must be adopted, and to allow for the frictional resistance to bending offered by pin or flat ends, (7) of Art. 100 is modified to i6E(jJ and 2$E[j} respectively, these values of /„ being based on experimental results. The form of Johnson's formula is a trifle more convenient than that of Rankine's. 103. Comparison with Experiments.	The Johnson formula, though simpler and often used in practical applications, has been extensively tested against experimental data to verify its accuracy and applicability under various conditions. It has been found that while Johnson's formula generally provides satisfactory results for columns with relatively low slenderness ratios, it begins to diverge from experimental outcomes as the slenderness ratio increases. This divergence is particularly noticeable when dealing with materials that exhibit significant non-linear behavior before failure, such as some grades of steel and aluminum. In these cases, the assumptions underlying Johnson's formula—that the material behaves in an elastic manner up to buckling—do not hold true. Instead, inelastic buckling can occur, which is not adequately predicted by the Johnson formula. Further, when comparing with experiments, it has been noted that the end conditions of the column play a crucial role. Johnson's formula incorporates adjustments for pin and flat ends, but these modifications are based on a somewhat simplified view of the end restraint conditions. Real-world end conditions can vary significantly, and this variation can lead to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and observed behaviors. In light of these	1908	2004.6677
"In other respects, however, the students of insect life are ""old-fashioned"" and resemble the botanists more closely than the zoologists, in that they are constrained by the extraordinary intricacy of their science to maintain the closest and most sympathetic cooperation with the taxonomists, morphologists, and students of geographical distribution. Without this cooperation their studies of insect parasitism would resolve themselves into a weltering chaos. 11 Howard and Fiske (loc. cit., p. 204) express a similar opinion when they say that ""it is probably true also that among those parasites which are the most closely restricted in their host relationships are to be found those which are the most effective in bringing about the control of their respective hosts."	This hint of specialization among parasites underscores a critical aspect of entomological research: the deep interdependencies not only among species but also among the various disciplines that study them. Thus, it becomes evident that the entomologist must often wear many hats, delving into the minutiae of evolutionary biology, ecology, and even genetics to fully understand the complex dynamics at play. Moreover, the intricate dance between parasite and host, often honed over millennia of co-evolution, offers a fascinating glimpse into the natural selection processes that govern life at its most fundamental levels. These relationships, characterized by their specificity, reveal a delicate balance where the survival of the parasite intricately intertwines with the biology of the host. This balance can have profound implications for ecosystems and can be leveraged for biological control strategies that manage pest populations in more sustainable ways. Therefore, the study of insect parasitism not only illuminates the path to understanding biological control but also enriches our comprehension of biodiversity and the resilience of ecosystems. As such, the collaboration across different scientific disciplines becomes not just beneficial but essential, pooling together a mosaic	1911	2007.3599
Now Pasteur observed a remarkable reaction carried out by the bacteria that cause butyric fermentation of sugar, in which a fatty acid of the same series as stearic acid is formed from sugar together with carbonic acid and hydrogen. This same butyric acid was produced by the organism when lactic acid was given instead of sugar.	"He further noted that this transformation occurred under anaerobic conditions, which led him to a deeper understanding of the metabolic processes involved. Pasteur's experiments demonstrated that the bacteria could break down sugars in the absence of oxygen, a process he termed ""fermentation."" This discovery was crucial as it challenged the then-prevailing theory that oxygen was essential for all forms of life and biochemical processes. The formation of butyric acid from sugars and lactic acid illustrated the versatility and adaptability of bacterial metabolism, opening new avenues in the study of biochemical pathways. Pasteur's work laid the groundwork for future research into anaerobic digestion and its applications, including the production of biofuels and the management of waste. His meticulous approach to studying these bacteria involved not only observing the end products of fermentation but also isolating the microorganisms responsible and testing their abilities under controlled conditions. This methodical process underscored the importance of microbial roles in chemical transformations, setting foundational principles for microbiology and biochemistry."	1913	2007.6074
If they had big units only, and these high up, they would have to be exceptionally big, otherwise there would be low average illumination; therefore, if this form of lighting was considered necessary, small units should be installed to increase the illumination of the platforms when the trains came in. In the case of gas, high pressure gas could be adopted for the roof lighting, and smaller gas units for the actual lighting. With regard to the height of lamps in goods yards, he had mentioned 50 ft., but there was a little confusion there because they would notice that he had been dealing with the lighting of goods sheds, and then, without a separate heading, he went on to the illumination of shunting yards. Next, as to the height at which measurements should be taken.	It was generally agreed that the standard height for measuring illumination levels should be at about one meter above ground level, corresponding roughly to the height of a work surface or the average eye level of a person. This would provide a more accurate representation of the effective illumination experienced by individuals in the space. For spaces such as platforms and goods yards, where both visibility and safety are crucial, ensuring adequate light distribution at this height is essential. Furthermore, he suggested that in areas where precision tasks are performed, such as ticket counters or control panels, localized task lighting should be considered to supplement the general ambient lighting. This would help to reduce eye strain and increase efficiency by providing higher illumination levels exactly where needed. In order to achieve a balanced approach to lighting that takes into account both functionality and energy efficiency, he recommended the implementation of a layered lighting design. This would involve the use of high-intensity, high-mounted fixtures to provide basic ambient lighting, supplemented by lower-mounted fixtures and task-specific lighting solutions to enhance visibility and functionality in key areas.	1912	2002.1642
"The above "" Lightly Clouded"" group only iuclude3 amounts of cloud up to 3, and since ic dees not contain many ascents with large vertical currents it seems that these must be associated with amounts of cloud larger than three. It was found at Pyrton Hill that days with an entire absence of cloud were always days also with an absence of vertical currents. Returning to Table VI., it is of considerable interest to notice that the increase of horizontal velocity with height at levels above 100 mettes seems to be more direcily connected with the amount of cloud present in the ky than with the magnitude of the existing vertical currents. This is somewhat remarkable in view of the circumstance that it is the vertical currents which one woull suppose produce the equalisation of the horizontal velocities at different heights. The change of velocity between 50 and 100 metres height is practically the same in all four columns of Table VI., and teems to be unaffected by the different conditions, as would perhaps be expected."	Nevertheless, the data suggest that the presence of clouds, perhaps acting as indicators of broader atmospheric conditions, can significantly influence wind patterns at higher altitudes. It is possible that the clouds themselves are a result of these larger atmospheric movements, which in turn affect the horizontal velocities observed. This implies a complex interaction between vertical and horizontal air movements that is not fully understood and warrants further investigation. Further analysis of the data, particularly focusing on days with higher cloud amounts, could help clarify whether these trends hold consistently across different meteorological conditions and geographical areas. Additionally, a deeper examination into the types of clouds present during these measurements might provide insights into the specific atmospheric dynamics at play. For instance, cumulus clouds associated with thermal updrafts might have different impacts compared to stratus clouds formed in stable air masses. Moreover, integrating data from other meteorological stations and comparing it with the findings from Pyrton Hill could help determine if these observations are locally specific or if they represent a more generalizable phenomenon in atmospheric science. This broader approach could contribute significantly to our understanding of wind shear and its implications for weather forecasting	1912	2005.733
On his return to America, at the time of the opening of the romance, he is met at the docks by a number of friends, including his affianced bride, Miss Kimball, and his brother Frank, a corporation lawyer. Miss Kimball, who some months earlier while in Europe had become engaged to Dr. Earl, is a beauty of the Dresden china type. She is superficial and intellectually shallow, as she is conventional and reactionary. Her mother is the head of the Anti suffragist League and a leading light among the ultra reactionary element of New York society. Her father is one of the very rich men of the nation.	Dr. Earl, on the other hand, is a man of deep convictions and progressive ideals. His time abroad had further solidified his beliefs in social reform and the importance of public welfare. This ideological divide between him and Miss Kimball was not immediately apparent during their courtship in Europe, where the glittering distractions of travel and romance had overshadowed deeper discussions of their values and visions for the future. As the ship pulled into the harbor, the crisp ocean breeze seemed to underscore the growing chasm between their worlds. Miss Kimball, adorned in the latest fashion, was more concerned with the social pageantry of their arrival than the earnest discussions of societal change that Dr. Earl had engaged in with some of his fellow passengers during the voyage. Frank, observing the couple as they disembarked, sensed the tension. His legal mind, trained to foresee conflict and seek resolution, began to ponder the sustainability of their union. He wondered whether his brother's fervent advocacy for change and Miss Kimball's entrenched conservatism could ever truly align. The reunion was polite, yet underneath the surface, there were under	1911	1988.9548
The Hon. Secretary, in the course of his visit to the Continent, took the opportunity of interviewing some of the experts on this Committee and the representatives of various Government departments interested in the subject, and it is hoped that the action taken by France will shortly be followed in other countries. The experience of authorities in different countries is needed in these matters, in order that general recommendations which will be acceptable throughout the world may ultimately be made, and also with a view to avoiding any errors which might naturally arise in physiological investigations conducted only on a few individuals. It may also be mentioned that the conditions of illumination in factories and workshops has been the subject of much consideration in the United States. As an example we may mention the formation of the National Association for the Conservation of Eyesight, which will doubtless aid the good work in this direction already being done by the American Illuminating Engineering Society.	Furthermore, Germany has shown considerable interest in this area, having established strict regulations regarding the optimal lighting conditions in industrial settings to prevent worker fatigue and to enhance productivity. The German standards are often cited as a benchmark in international discussions on industrial health safety.  In the United Kingdom, similar concerns have led to the formation of various committees within the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, focusing specifically on the implications of inadequate lighting on workplace accidents. These committees work closely with British industries to implement more scientifically grounded lighting standards. It is clear that this issue transcends national boundaries and calls for a coordinated international effort. Therefore, discussions are underway to organize a global conference on industrial illumination, with the aim of sharing best practices and developing a comprehensive set of guidelines that could be adopted worldwide. This initiative is seen as a critical step towards not only enhancing worker safety but also improving efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of industrial operations. Such efforts underscore the growing recognition of the intricate link between workplace conditions and broader socio-economic and environmental outcomes.	1912	2003.7069
"Yet it is to me, and to me alone, that he owes an extra quarter share for his wife, a royal pension for himself, and a testimonial to his probity, which was attacked by one of his superiors, and more than suspected by others. ""l On this speech Mile Clairon makes her exit. She was a great tragedian even in her anger; but her anger was too great for her fortunes. Poor woman! other disappointments awaited her. Abandoned by the public whose idol she had believed she was, she was soon to find herself forsaken by a lover for whom she had made real and important sacrifices. A gilded exile at Anspach, where she was invited by the young margrave, consoled and saddened her. She was old and poor when she came back to Paris in 1791."	There, in a small, dimly lit apartment on the outskirts of the bustling city, Clairon lived out her final years. The world she had once dazzled with her dramatic prowess had shifted, and the new Republic's tastes had changed. Theater-goers now sought the raw emotion of revolutionary drama, and the classical tragedies in which Clairon had excelled were considered relics of a bygone aristocratic era. Despite her isolation, she was not entirely forgotten. A few faithful admirers and former colleagues visited her, bringing news of the outside world and occasionally seeking her advice on theatrical matters. Clairon, with her sharp mind still intact, would speak passionately about the art of drama, her words echoing the grandeur of her stage days. In her solitude, Clairon also penned her memoirs, a mix of poignant reflections and sharp critiques of the theatrical world. These writings, published posthumously, provided a fascinating insight into the life of one of the eighteenth century's greatest actresses and the turbulent times in which she lived. Her death, though quiet and unremarkable, marked the	1912	1974.5354

He did away with all of them and half a dozen others, and in a few minutes was humming up Fifth Avenue to her hotel, through a sparkling atmosphere, for the hopeless fog of the day before had vanished. At the open door of her little salon he stood for a moment, wavering, powerless, paying the penalty of years of repression, while she, gasping his  754 name, pushing aside her breakfast table, came running to him. He met her halfway and caught her wrists, pulling them to his sides, looking down into her face."	"Her eyes, wide and luminous, searched his with a mixture of confusion and relief. ""You came,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the city that filtered through the open windows. ""Yes, I came,"" he replied, his voice steadier than he felt. The tension between them palpable, a mingling of past hurts and present uncertainties. She drew a shaky breath, stepping closer, her hands still held by his. ""I wasn't sure you would, after... everything."" He softened, his grip loosening but not letting go. ""I had to see you, to explain—"" ""No, don't,"" she interrupted, placing a finger gently over his lips. ""Not yet. Just—just let us have this moment."" For a long time, they simply stood there, in the middle of her salon, the chaos of their lives held at bay.

In the observation and experience of the writer, the wealthy and well-to-do laymen are not, for the most part, hostile to the ethical notions pervading the congregations. The opposition — and it is very bitter — comes from certain prominent laymen who are not rich in things material. They are legalists purely, and see only that side of religion; and in not a few instances they seem to think that to oppose social and ethical doctrines in the church will give them favour with the rich. Regardless of the merits or demerits of Church Socialism, these are the greatest obstacles to a sympathetic understanding between the moneyed men in the church who do not favour Socialism and the rank and file who do.	The crux of the matter often lies in the interpretation of what constitutes true religious duty and community service. These laymen, entrenched in their views, argue that the church should focus solely on spiritual salvation and maintain a strict separation from worldly concerns, including social justice issues. They fear that engaging too deeply in these areas might dilute the church's primary mission or alienate its more conservative members. On the other side, proponents of integrating social ethics into church doctrine argue that true spirituality cannot be divorced from action. They cite scripture and the tradition of prophetic engagement with society to support their stance that faith must actively engage with and challenge societal injustices. This group often includes not only the less affluent, but also a segment of the wealthier parishioners who see their resources as a means to enact positive change aligned with their spiritual values. This division is not merely theological but touches on deeper fears and discomforts about the role of the church in a rapidly changing world. Those resisting the integration of social ethics fear the loss of a familiar refuge, a place that stands apart from the turbulence of societal change	1911	2007.3181
To meet the case, the proper legal  491  COLONIAL INN, FAIRTIOPE steps were taken, and the village community, including the village portion of the corporation lands, was incorporated into a municipality. Through that channel the people can gratify their desires and have the cost collected through additional taxes, which the Fairhope Single Tax Corporation cheerfully pays. As this course widens the responsibility in public administration, it also widens the personal interest of the people in the public service and its management. In both respects it cannot fail to be a distinct advantage, but it remains to be seen with what harmony and wisdom the municipality will absorb the rents collected, and with what patience and public spirit the people will pay the rents necessary to meet the expenses which they incur.	The transition to a municipal form of government has brought about a notable shift in the dynamics of local governance. With the incorporation, residents now find themselves directly involved in the stewardship of their community, a role that demands a new level of engagement and understanding. The municipality, acting as the intermediary for collecting and allocating the single tax, faces the challenge of managing these funds with transparency and efficacy. The success of this model hinges on the ability of the municipal officers to judiciously manage the collected rents, ensuring they are channeled into projects and services that directly benefit the community. Moreover, the shift to a municipal government requires a cultural adjustment for the residents of Fairhope. Accustomed to a more direct management of community resources, they must now place their trust in their elected officials to handle these responsibilities. This change tests the community's patience and civic virtue, as they must collectively bear the burden of taxation while maintaining faith in their representatives to act in their best interest. The experiment at Fairhope serves as a microcosm for larger discussions about governance, taxation, and community involvement. If successful,	1911	2006.1747

When Huxley proved conclusively that God had ceased to exist, or had never existed save in the minds of His purblind devotees, he merely showed that in that realm, also, "" Le Roi est mart — vive le Rot!

Almost the only men who still worship this half god are the medical profession, and so complete is their faith that they are prepared to make any sacrifices — even human — to its insatiable greed.

Indeed, the worship of Reason as an infallible monarch has led to a myriad of social and ethical issues, where the atypical is feared rather than understood. The so-called ""normal"" is often a straitjacket, a set of arbitrary standards that marginalizes those who do not conform. This normativity is a cage, and those who enforce it—whether through medicine, law, or cultural mores—are the jailers.

"Application to aircraft. — Let Ty denote the thrust applied to an aerial machine to produce velocity V; the curve expressing Tx as a function of V is called the ' characteristic ' of the machine (flight supposed horizontal). For an airship TS = AV. For an aeroplane TA = AV + BW+ CWIV approximately, where W is the total weight. The aeroplane curve is an hyperbola, having for asymptotes the axis of T, and the line TA = A F + BW, which is nearly parallel to TA = AV, B !>eing small. The useful portion of the curve is limited by two ordinate corresponding to values 1"", and V. Propeller diagram. — From the experiments of Dorand, it appears that, within certain limits, we can write TlV'=Aa) = F(P)t whence the curves giving 2' as a function of V, for different constant values of p, are straight lines passing through the origin. The propeller diagrams also include curves giving Q as a function of I""' for the same values of p. One line or curve corresponds to the maximum value of p : to any other value of the efficiency correspond two lines, one on either side of that for p max. The portion of the diagram comprised between the lines for which p = 0'6 (arbitrary value) is called the useful field of the propeller."	In this context, the propeller's performance can be visualized effectively through these diagrams, illustrating how changes in velocity (V) impact the thrust (T) and the power coefficient (Q) under varying efficiency (p) scenarios. The relationship between thrust and velocity, as well as power and velocity, is crucial for optimizing the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. Further analysis of the propeller characteristics involves examining the interaction between the blade pitch, diameter, and the resultant force vectors. As the propeller spins, each blade cuts through the air at a specific angle (pitch), which determines the amount of lift versus drag produced per rotation. Adjusting the pitch can shift the operational characteristics of the propeller, effectively moving the useful field within the propeller diagram to achieve desired performance outcomes. For aircraft designers and engineers, understanding these dynamics is essential for selecting or designing propellers that match the specific performance requirements of the aircraft. This includes considerations for takeoff, cruising, and landing phases, where different speeds and power outputs are needed.

It is only by preventing usurpation that our independence and liberty will not be jeopardised by decisions of tyrannical judges. It is the function of the press to diagnose our social ills. We must know the truth, and only the truth can set us free. To this end any so-called exposure must be preceded by a thorough and intelligent investigation and the facts ascertained must be presented with a view to disseminating the information thus obtained. Of course the presentation must be skilful and interesting. If the investigation is thorough, the presentation skilful and the purpose to secure a remedy, there is probably no social ill which cannot be profitably treated. — Louis D. Brandeis. SOCIALISM IN THE CHURCHES By Rev. J. R. Perkins THERE is a new heresy. It is not theological and metaphysical like old heresies, but it is social and ethical.	It challenges the very foundations of our economic structures and calls for a radical reformation not only in the secular realm but within the sanctuaries of our spiritual lives. This heresy, known as 'Socialism,' has begun to permeate our churches, stirring both consternation and inspiration among the faithful. Many of our clergy have taken up the cause, arguing that the Gospel itself is a message of radical equality and communal sharing. They point to the early Christian communities described in the Acts of the Apostles, where believers held all things in common, and none among them suffered from want. This, they claim, is the blueprint for a Christian society, and it is their duty to advocate for a system that mirrors this divine ideal. Critics, however, decry this movement as a dangerous conflation of the spiritual and the political. They argue that by aligning the church with a specific economic ideology, clergy are overstepping their bounds and risking the alienation of their congregations. Moreover, they contend that socialism, with its historical baggage and varied interpretations, is too contentious and fraught	1911	1947.6835
"Maude"" I knew to be Mrs. Edgell, a cousin, on the mother's side, of Mrs. Atheling's. Mrs. Edgell I had often met, and I shouldn't have picked her out for philanthropy even in its more personal forms. She had all the looks Lois Atheling hadn't — all the looks and all the money. I don't know how to classify her beauty, except to say that her face, quite unlike Mrs. Atheling's, was precisely the kind to convince a jury. She had often, rather vaguely, asked me to come and see her, and I had sometimes rather vaguely gone. She wasn't clever, but it was always good to lean back and look at her across the footlights. Sidney Edgell, her husband, I didn't like. He was good looking and successful and spoiled; and I had just a suspicion that he was probably a bounder. I had never cared to know him well enough to find out. """	But on this particular evening, as I entered their opulent drawing room, Sidney was not present, which I counted as a small mercy. Mrs. Edgell, resplendent in a gown that shimmered like the evening star, greeted me with her usual languid charm. Her manner was one of effortless grace, a stark contrast to the somewhat strained civility I had always sensed in her husband. As we settled into the plush settees that adorned her salon, the conversation meandered from trivial social gossip to more personal matters. Maude spoke of her recent travels, the operas she had attended, and the endless rounds of charity balls that filled her calendar—not out of any deep-seated altruism, I suspected, but rather as a social obligation befitting her status. It was all very pleasant and predictably superficial. Our talk took an unexpected turn when she inquired, rather delicately, about my thoughts on philanthropy. It seemed an odd topic coming from her, and I couldn't help but wonder if this was merely polite conversation or if she was seeking something	1913	1930.6793
A theory of later years has, however, provided a reasonable explanation. It is that the moon was at one time a part of the same mass as the earth, which became separated from it before the earth had quite cooled down and solidified into its present form, and was then gradually driven farther and farther away from the earth by natural forces. It was therefore originally as hot as the rest of the mass which formed the earth, but being formed into a smaller globe of much less gravity — only one sixth of that of the earth — volcanic action of the same intensity as that on the earth would have a much more far reaching effect. A force which on the earth would project volcanic lava and scoriae a distance of three miles would, on the moon, project it a distance of eighteen miles.	Thus, the lunar landscape, with its vast plains and towering peaks, was sculpted not only by the force of its own volcanic activity but also by the reduced gravitational pull that allowed such forces to propel materials much farther than on Earth. This explains the extensive maria and high-rising mountain ranges that are so characteristic of the Moon's surface. The diminished gravity also means that the atmosphere could not be retained, leading to the Moon's airless environment which further preserves its ancient geological features without the erosive processes that occur on Earth. Furthermore, the Moon's slower rate of cooling, due to its smaller size, allowed volcanic activity to continue over a longer period in its geological history. This prolonged volcanic activity contributed to the varied and dramatic landscapes we observe today. The craters, formed by meteor impacts and volcanic explosions, are far better preserved than similar features on Earth due to the lack of atmospheric weathering and water erosion. Each crater, maria, and mountain tells a story of a cosmic event in the Moon’s developmental history, providing scientists with valuable insights into the processes that shaped not only the	1911	1991.5365
"Phobos revolves round the planet in the very short period of 7 hours, 39 minutes, and 14 seconds, and therefore makes more than three complete revolutions round the planet in the course of a single Martian day. The peculiar phenomena to which this very rapid motion gives rise, and the numerous eclipses which occur, will be matters of great interest to us all when we reach Mars. Our moon, as you know, takes a month to make one revolution round the earth."" "" Professor, "" said John, ""when we get to Mars, it will be rather a curious experience for us to see two moons shining in the sky at the same time!"" ""My word !"" exclaimed M'Allister, ""two moons shining at once!"	"That would indeed be a sight to behold! Imagine, one could be setting while the other is rising, casting their dual glows across the Martian landscape. It would be quite the spectacle and a photographer's dream."" ""The smaller moon, Deimos, takes about 30 hours to complete its orbit,"" the professor continued, adjusting his glasses with an air of excitement. ""So, while Phobos zips rapidly across the sky, Deimos moves much more leisurely. This difference in orbital speed could create some fascinating visual effects and possibly even influence the planet's surface conditions."" John pondered this for a moment, his mind racing with the possibilities. ""Would these rapid orbits and frequent eclipses affect the surface temperatures?"" ""Quite possibly,"" the professor replied. ""The shadows cast by these moons, especially during eclipses, could cause temporary drops in temperature. The frequency of these events might make the Martian climate even more complex and variable than we initially thought."" M'Allister, who had been quietly listening, chimed in, ""And what about the gravitational effects? With Phobos"	1911	1998.8237
"He became Alacddin's greatest general, and carried victorious arms into surrounding lands. This was the nucleus of the Turkish Empire that under Ertoghrul's son Osman, who succeeded Alacddin, reached to the shores of the Black Sea. So the Turkish nation is unknown to itself as ""Turkish"" (that being an opprobrious term suggesting barbarian), but they know themselves as Osmanlis, and it is the sword of Osman — whom they regard as the father of their country — that is girded upon each sultan at Eyoub, when the sacred rank is set upon him, just as in the rest of Europe a crown is placed upon the head of a king. The descendants of Osman fought their way noarer> and nearer to Constantinople, Allah aiding them by throwing down the walls of cities by earthquakes, that Turkish generals might enter without a blow. At last the prophecy was fulfilled, and Mohammed II."	entered the city in triumph in 1453, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire and the beginning of a new era in the history of the region. Under his rule, Constantinople was transformed into Istanbul, becoming the heart of the Ottoman Empire. The city flourished as a center of trade, culture, and religion, drawing influences from both the East and the West. The Ottomans continued to expand their territory, stretching their empire across three continents and establishing themselves as a dominant power in the Mediterranean and beyond. The legacy of Osman and his descendants was not merely one of conquest, but also of cultural and administrative innovations. They established a sophisticated system of governance that allowed for a diverse empire to thrive under a centralized authority. The Millet system, for instance, allowed various religious communities to govern themselves under their own laws while still contributing to the empire's overall stability and prosperity. This tolerance helped to ensure the loyalty of conquered peoples and facilitated the exchange of ideas and customs among different cultures within the empire. Thus, from the humble beginnings of a small band of warriors, the Ottom	1913	1984.4823
"He used two methods of comparison of materials — (1) the loads which produce a scratch o oi mm. wide, and (2) the width of scratch under a given load, the width of scratch in either case being determined by means of a microscope. 185. Impact Tests. — The failure in materials used in high speed machinery under repeated forces of an impulsive character, even when such material has shown satisfactory strength and elongation in a static tensile test, has led to many attempts to devise a shock or impact test which should discover the imperfection in a material likely to fracture "" by shock."" Impact testing machines generally attempt to measure the energy absorbed by a test piece in fracture by a single blow or the number of blows of given energy necessary to produce fracture. Machines in which the blow given by a falling weight fractures a test piece by simple 1 See Engineering, January 12, 1906, or Engineer, October 28, 1904."	pendulum action are most common. The Charpy and Izod tests are perhaps the most recognized among these. In the Charpy test, the specimen is supported as a horizontal beam and is struck by a pendulum. In the Izod test, the specimen is held vertically and the pendulum strikes the upper end. The amount of energy absorbed in breaking the specimen is measured and this gives a quantifiable idea of the material's toughness. 186. Corrosion Tests. — The resistance of materials to corrosion under various conditions is another critical factor, especially in applications involving exposure to harsh environments or chemicals. Corrosion tests are designed to simulate these conditions and predict the lifespan and durability of materials. Common methods include salt spray tests, where specimens are subjected to a fine mist of saltwater solution, and immersion tests, where specimens are submerged in chemicals for controlled periods. These tests help in evaluating the protective measures needed for materials used in construction, marine, automotive, and other industries. 187. Hardness Tests. — Hardness is a measure of a material's resistance to permanent shape change when a	1908	1982.9745
The ratio of lift to drift, in a single vol plane was found to be C. The lift coefficients are plotted against the angle of incidence ; the observations throughout the two flights show good agreement ; and the lift variation with angle of incidence follows a straight line law within the limits of accuracy of the measurements. 181. Toussaint, A., and Xiepere, G. /. ; stabilisation aulomatique ties aeroplanes el un moyen de la rktliser (La Technique Aeronantique, July 1, 1912). — An account of a method of stabilisation designed (1) to regulate the velocity of the aeroplane, (2) to give lateral stability, (3) to give longitudinal stability.	The device described by Toussaint and Xiepere involves the use of gyroscopic controls coupled with automatic pilot mechanisms. The gyroscopes are employed to detect any deviation from a predetermined orientation or flight path, while the automatic pilot adjusts the control surfaces in response to these deviations to maintain stability. The system is designed to operate independently of the pilot’s manual controls, although it can be overridden at any time. The regulation of velocity is achieved through a feedback system that adjusts the throttle based on airspeed sensors. This ensures that the aircraft maintains a consistent speed, which is crucial for stable flight, especially under varying atmospheric conditions. Lateral stability is maintained by automatically adjusting the ailerons to counteract rolling motions, while longitudinal stability is managed through the manipulation of the elevators to control the pitch of the aircraft. This innovative approach to stabilization not only improves the safety and handling of the aircraft but also reduces the workload on the pilot, allowing for more focus on navigation and other critical tasks. The potential for this technology to enhance the performance and safety of both military and commercial aviation is considerable, marking a	1912	1987.2472
Yet, truly, he had yielded in the end, as he always yielded. And she claimed the core of him was sound and generous? It was so! Yes, it was so! He was not the hard, base, greedy thing he had so often feared he was. Unbelievable — but she had proved it. . . . Why, the woman knew him as God knew him, as he did not even know himself! He looked from her cramped, shrivelled fingers to her lined cheeks with a sudden ecstasy like that of youth.	The realization washed over him in a warm, soothing wave. She saw beyond the gruff exterior, the brusque manners that he often presented to the world. She saw into the very essence of his being, recognizing the tender humanity that he so fervently tried to shield. In her eyes, he was not merely the sum of his actions or the facade he wore like armor; he was the culmination of his intentions, his struggles, his desires for goodness that battled daily with his flaws. Her understanding was a balm to his often-weary soul, a beacon that guided him through his own self-doubt. How had he become so fortunate to be seen so completely, so deeply? It was as if she had unraveled him, thread by thread, and in doing so, had woven him back together with strands of her unwavering faith in him. With a reverence that bordered on reverence, he reached out, his hand trembling slightly as he touched her face. The creases that time had etched into her skin were like sacred texts to him now, each line a testament	1913	1984.5421
"Wuttke, op. cit. § 108 p. 89 tg.). d£sespoir n'entendent pas sa voix, northeast southeast souviennent pas de ses prescriptions."" The revival of classical learning, accompanied as it was by admiration for antiquity and a desire to imitate its great men, not only increased the number of suicides, but influenced popular sentiments on the subject."	"The Stoic philosophy, which was revived during the Renaissance, held that suicide could be a rational and even noble choice under certain circumstances. This perspective was reflected in the writings and lives of many figures from antiquity, who were held up as examples during this period. Such views were disseminated through the newly established printing presses, spreading these classical ideas more broadly and deeply than had been possible in the past. As these ancient texts became more accessible, so too did the concept of the ""noble death,"" which provided a philosophical justification for ending one's life under conditions of extreme adversity or dishonor. This notion resonated particularly in the context of the humanist emphasis on the dignity of the individual and the value of personal autonomy. The tragic heroes of Greek and Roman literature, who chose death over dishonor, were elevated as exemplars of this ideal. Moreover, the Renaissance's focus on individualism and personal achievement created a context in which failure to live up to one's own expectations or societal ideals could be seen as a profound personal defeat. This, coupled with the Stoic idea that one could"	1908	1968.6703
One should endeavour to depict the most ordinary situations, those in which many persons may find themselves. Then the lessons of conduct will be useful. I am not a competent judge of the style, but the plan of the work did not interest me; the pathos which Mr. Burke had promised me did not strike me ; the pleading in favour of robbers, thieves, and people of bad morals was very far from pleasing me. We must tell men : Always be honest; honour, once lost, is never regained. That would throw them into despair, people will say; you would deprive them of all desire to get back to the path of duty. My friend, experience proves that he whose ideas have been turned towards baseness and crime by misery or want, and who has looked shame in the face and run the risk of deserving it, is a man whose heart is corrupted.	It is a harsh truth, yet one that must be acknowledged if we are to address the root of the problem. The notion that a simple exhortation to honesty can redeem such individuals is overly optimistic. True reform requires more than mere words; it necessitates a profound transformation of one's character and circumstances. Society must not only encourage virtue but also actively rehabilitate those who have strayed. This involves providing education, meaningful employment, and, critically, a supportive community that does not perpetually punish past transgressions but rather fosters a genuine opportunity for redemption. Moreover, the portrayal of criminals in literature and discourse should not romanticize their deeds nor should it instill a sense of fatalism about their prospects for reform. Rather, it should reflect the complex human realities that underlie criminal behavior, which often include profound despair and societal neglect. By understanding these underlying issues, we can better address the causes of crime and support effective rehabilitation, rather than simply condemning those who falter. In sum, while maintaining the integrity of moral teachings, we must also embrace a more nuanced and compassionate approach to	1912	1996.4734
"Purdy and several men of the fifty second Regiment identified Cornelius Garvin's photograph as that of a boy called by the nickname of "" Watches "" or "" Watchless, "" who, until he disappeared in November, 1863, had been connected with Company I. But, ""if this be true, "" says the official report, "" Cornelius Garvin was not enrolled in the company even under an assumed name, for the rolls of this and other companies have been carefully examined and the men present recognised, and the names of those absent from any cause whatever have been identified with parties other than the person known as ' Watches' or ' Watchless ' or Garvin."" The War Department rests its case. With Mrs. Garvin, during the year and a half that the War Department searched and investigated, fate had dealt almost as unkindly as with her boy. The first blow fell in April, when Attorney A. A. Lee, employed by the United States government to conduct, in Troy, an investigation of the kidnapping charge, told the story of Con's last day at the County House. "" Stokes [an inmate] swears that on a Saturday in the latter part of August, Garvin and himself were picking up potatoes; that Garvin obtained an old tree and, placing it against the fence, escaped. Stokes, a cripple, could not pursue, but he gave the alarm. James Else pursued, but could not catch Garvin."	The search continued for days, but no trace of the boy was found after that. He had vanished as completely as if the earth had swallowed him. Mrs. Garvin, who had clung to every shred of hope, was devastated by the news. Her health, already fragile from the strain of not knowing her son's fate, further deteriorated. She spent her days moving between the War Department, her attorney's office, and the local police station, seeking any new information that might surface about her son. The community rallied around her, offering support and assistance, but the mystery of Cornelius Garvin's whereabouts remained unsolved. The local newspapers periodically revisited the story, each time reigniting a spark of hope that soon flickered out. Mrs. Garvin's home became a place of pilgrimage for those who had lost loved ones in the war or through other tragic circumstances. They shared their grief and found solace in their collective mourning. Meanwhile, the War Department continued its investigation but with each passing month, the trail grew colder. They expanded their search to include neighboring states, circulated	1913	1985.3545
""" 'Actions speak louder than words.' Governor Marshal can talk very bravely at public meetings denouncing abuse of power, but when the opportunity has been offered him to provide an effective remedy he not only fails to provide it, but does what he can to place an obstacle in the way of its future adoption. When he made the passage of such progressive legislation, as he did not absolutely prohibit, depend on the petition of 25 percent of the voters of so large a state as Indiana, he blocked progress as effectively as one man can. So large a percentage is almost impossible to obtain. Even if the required number should sign, the legislature would not be obliged to pass the measure. ""Governor Marshal is a candidate for the Presidency."	"He wishes to appear as a champion of reform, yet his actions do not align with the progressive image he projects. This inconsistency between his public declarations and his legislative actions has not gone unnoticed by the electorate. His reluctance to push for tangible change, despite his vocal advocacy, raises questions about his genuine commitment to the reforms he espouses. Furthermore, his strategic placement of high petition thresholds demonstrates a savvy understanding of political maneuvering, yet it also reveals a cautious, perhaps even cynical, approach to governance. By setting such an impractical benchmark, he effectively stalls the implementation of policies that could challenge the status quo or disrupt powerful interests within the state. As the campaign for the Presidency intensifies, it is imperative for voters to scrutinize not only the rhetoric of the candidates but also their records. Governor Marshal's record, in particular, shows a pattern of hesitance and half-measures. It is crucial for the electorate to consider whether his leadership style—marked by a disparity between words and deeds—aligns with the transformative leadership they seek in a President."""	1911	2007.3068
The third opinion of systematic work, held in some degree by many zoologists, though often more or less unconsciously and seldom openly avowed, is that it forms an elementary sort of study which has a certain educational value in training the eye and the judgement of those who are to become zoologists. It bears much the same relation to zoology proper that arithmetic does to what we call higher mathematics, and the really able man will not delay in it, after he has secured the training  it affords. It is preeminently the field for the amateur and the untrained worker. According to this view, a piece of systematic work may well be a part of the training of all professional zoologists, but capable men will naturally go on into the supposedly more fertile fields of physiology, cytology and experimental zoology.	Thus, the practice of systematic zoology is seen not as an end in itself, but as a stepping stone to more complex and abstract biological sciences. This perspective considers systematic work to be somewhat mundane and mechanical—a necessary groundwork, but lacking the creative and intellectual rigor of experimental disciplines. It is here, in these more advanced fields, where hypotheses are tested, and new theories are forged, that the true essence of scientific inquiry is believed to lie. However, this view, while prevalent, does not universally hold sway. There are those who argue that systematic zoology remains not only foundational but also fundamentally indispensable to the broader field of biology. They contend that without a thorough understanding of the diversity and relationships of organisms, as provided by systematic studies, more experimental sciences might lack direction and context. The classification and description of species, they argue, enable a more informed approach to experimental methods and contribute profoundly to ecological and evolutionary studies. Moreover, the advent of molecular techniques has revitalized the field of systematics, allowing for more precise and insightful analyses of phylogenetic relationships. This integration of new technology demonstrates that	1911	1993.6072
The spines of cacti, especially the large curved and hooked ones of the Echinocacti, will take up water vapour, as has been demonstrated more than once in my work, but the very small amount of moisture thus acquired is not available to the living cells and is quickly lost when the plants are exposed to direct sunlight. The bark of the ocotillo (Fouquiera) will absorb liquid water and yield it to growing tissues, as has been found by Lloyd, the hairs of some south African succulents have been found to absorb moisture, and the fleshy beach plants will absorb either water vapour or liquid water through the leaves, especially when in a desiccated condition. Doubtless  55* the heavy fogs of the California coast are in this way a source of supply for Cakile and other halophytes. In none of these cases, however, is the existence of the plants concerned so dependent upon atmospheric absorp  Fig.	tion as might be supposed. The primary source of water for most succulents and halophytes remains the soil, even in arid conditions. The ability to absorb atmospheric moisture simply provides these plants with an additional mechanism to survive in their challenging environments. This supplemental moisture can be crucial during periods of drought when soil water is scarce. Furthermore, the structural adaptations of these plants often serve dual functions. For instance, the spines of cacti, while capable of absorbing moisture, primarily serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Similarly, the thick, waxy cuticles found on the leaves of many succulents prevent water loss, but also make them less permeable to the absorption of atmospheric moisture. Thus, while the adaptations for atmospheric moisture absorption in these plants are fascinating and contribute to their overall drought resilience, they are part of a broader suite of survival strategies that include water storage, reduced leaf surface area, deep or widespread root systems, and sometimes even behavioral changes such as closing stomata during the hottest parts of the day. These strategies collectively enable these plants to thrive in	1911	2006.4825
The priests in the hour of battle, ' he says, ' took their favourite image from its column and carried it to the field' (Turner, Hist. A. s. 5. 1. 156). Odin hung upon a tree which is called a gallows. As Christ, one with God yet the Son of God, offered himself a sacrifice to God in behalf of man, so Odin was a willing sacrifice unto himself.' Odin and Christ were both wounded with a spear as they hung, and both cried aloud with anguish. The resemblance' continues also between the mythical treatment of the cross and the myths of the holy tree of the pagans.	In both cases, the tree or cross is depicted not merely as a physical structure but as a cosmological axis, linking heaven, earth, and the underworld, bearing profound spiritual significance. The tree Yggdrasil in Norse mythology, similar to the Christian cross, is central to the cosmos, supporting and connecting all realms of existence. It is under this great tree that Odin sacrifices himself, a parallel to Christ's crucifixion on the cross, where He reconciles divine justice with mercy, offering salvation to mankind. Furthermore, both symbols serve as pivotal points of suffering, death, and ultimately, rebirth or resurrection, which are core themes in both religious traditions. The death of Odin and Christ are transformative, not merely ending in despair, but opening pathways to greater wisdom and spiritual insight. Odin gains the knowledge of the runes, symbols of great power and wisdom, while Christ's resurrection heralds the promise of eternal life and the forgiveness of sins for His followers. These myths, while rooted in very different cultural and religious backgrounds, use similar imagery and themes to express deep truths about the human condition	1904	1993.6755

"The recent authoritative statement that a single great emporium of trade contains over 140,000 people who are in perpetual want, even of the barest subsistence, a state of practically hopeless wretchedness, is in evidence that the poet's pitiful picture is not what it ought to be — ""a tale of the past, "" but a concrete glimpse of a monstrous present, even in so-called Christian lands. But surely a better day is at hand; its dawning is made manifest not only in the growth of the spirit of democracy, a higher regard for the rights of men, but in the clearer realisation of a truth which is of vital significance to all who are seeking to benefit their fellows — the truth that all real doing, all causation pertains not to the world of material things, but to the world of thought."	The recognition of this principle is slowly transforming the methods by which society addresses the issues of poverty and inequality. Instead of merely offering temporary relief, efforts are increasingly directed towards changing the conditions and mindsets that perpetuate such states. Education, once considered a privilege of the affluent, is now being recognized as a fundamental right and a necessary tool for empowerment.  Moreover, the rise of various social movements has contributed to a shift in public consciousness. These movements advocate for systemic changes that address the root causes of poverty, such as fair wages, access to healthcare, and the redistribution of resources. The growing influence of these groups is a testament to the increasing power of collective action and the potential of organized efforts to initiate substantial social reform. The emerging trend towards social entrepreneurship also highlights this shift towards thought-driven causation. Individuals and companies are innovating ways to solve social problems, creating businesses that not only aim for financial success but also strive to bring about positive social change. This blend of capitalism and activism underscores the evolving understanding that business and ethics can and should coexist. Thus, as we move forward, it	1911	2005.2445
"Up to the time of this unfortunate experiment by physicians in inoculating smallpox, the disease was not especially dreaded, nor were epidemics of frequent occurrence, according to the best medical authority of the age; but as soon as the doctors began their wholesale inoculation, using the virus of smallpox, the disease spread with amazing rapidity and the mortality became something appalling — so much so that the eighteenth century has come to be known as the smallpox century. Yet in spite of this fearful tribute of life, sacrificed on the altar of a medical delusion, the doctors were so obsessed with the idea that this was, to voice the dictum of the Royal College of Physicians of London, in 1774, a treatment ""highly salutary to the human race, "" that in England Parliament found it necessary to pass a statute in 1840 making inoculation of smallpox in England a penal offence, in order to protect the people from the deadly delusion of the profession."	This act, while it curtailed the practice of inoculation, did not immediately eradicate the belief in its supposed benefits. Many in the medical community continued to advocate for its use, citing cases where inoculated individuals experienced milder forms of the disease. The controversy lingered, illustrating the deep divide between traditional practices and emerging medical understanding. As the 19th century progressed, however, the focus shifted from inoculation to vaccination, a safer and more effective method introduced by Edward Jenner in 1796. Jenner's method used cowpox to confer immunity to smallpox, rather than the smallpox virus itself. This innovation marked a significant advancement in preventive medicine and gradually gained acceptance, overshadowing the older and riskier practice of inoculation. The transition was not swift nor entirely smooth, as public skepticism towards vaccination remained, fueled by the earlier disasters of inoculation. Nonetheless, the demonstrable efficacy of vaccination in preventing a deadly disease eventually overcame resistance, leading to widespread adoption and government support. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, vaccination campaigns had become	1911	2002.201
"When we have examined these four phases of the Roman Conquest, having no informa tion worth the gathering of the strategics following upon the conquest, we shall have concluded this first section in the elements of British Strategical History, in which the rivers were the principal determinants, and enter its second phase, the Dark Ages, in which the rivers are again the determinants, no longer as obstacles, but as avenues of advance for the Pirates. To fix a strategical frontier for the first period of the occupation might seem to a modern Englishman a difficult thing. We   are so used to numerous made roads, to travel by railway, to bridged rivers, etc., that we have lost the "" eye "" for a military obstacle in modern England, and we see none definitely drawn upon the map, protecting the south and east from sea to sea."	However, in those ancient times, the natural features of the landscape played a crucial role in determining strategic positions and frontiers. The Roman legions, adept in the arts of war and fortification, would have considered various factors such as the proximity to water sources, elevation for visibility and defense, and the density of forests which could either offer concealment or obstacles to movement. The primary frontier during much of the Roman occupation was the line of forts and walls stretching from the Solway Firth to the River Tyne, known famously as Hadrian's Wall. This monumental structure was not just a barrier against incursions but a clear demarcation of the extent of Roman control, serving both military and administrative purposes. South of this line, the Romans established a network of roads that facilitated rapid troop movements and economic integration, further solidifying their hold on the territory. As we transition into the Dark Ages, the strategic importance of rivers reasserts itself, but under vastly different circumstances. With the decline of Roman authority and the fragmentation of their infrastructural achievements, the rivers once again became wild barriers and	1912	1976.2834
If all the sails were hoisted on a horizontal instead of a vertical mast a decidedly smaller motive force would result because of the weaker wind near the water surface. If all the sails could be supported at the top of the mast instead of strung from bottom to top, a decidedly greater wind force would result than is obtained on a typical sail driven vessel. If a ship's supporting structure will permit, it is imperative that the skipper of a sailing craft carry as much sail as high as possible to take advantage of the maximum obtainable wind. VELOCITY AND DIRECTION CHANGE. — Precise handling of aircraft during takeoff and landing requires recognition of changes in direction and velocity of winds near the surface. If a south wind is prevailing at the airport landing level it will be more to the South southwest at 1000 feet than South.	This shift in direction and increase in velocity with altitude is known as wind gradient, and is a critical factor for pilots to consider, particularly during the approach and departure phases of flight. The wind gradient can cause an aircraft to experience a sudden loss of airspeed during landing, which can lead to a stall if not anticipated and managed correctly.  Moreover, the effect of wind gradient is not uniform across different types of terrain. Over open water or flat plains, the gradient may be less pronounced compared to areas with obstructions such as buildings or hills, where the wind can be funneled or obstructed, leading to more significant shifts in velocity and direction. Understanding these nuances is crucial for accurate navigation and maintaining control of the aircraft during critical maneuvers. Pilots must constantly monitor their instruments and be prepared to make adjustments based on real-time observations of wind behavior. This includes altering the approach path, adjusting the throttle, or changing the flap settings to compensate for the increased or decreased wind speed at different altitudes. The ability to swiftly interpret and react to these changes is a hallmark of skilled airmanship	1913	1984.9298
The four German armoured cruisers of the second division turned within 1500 yards of the head of the British line, firing torpedoes and delivering and receiving a terrific shell fire. One torpedo boat followed each German cruiser closely, and as the four cruisers turned, the torpedo craft, instead of following them, charged home. The manoeuvre was so unexpected and so hazardous that it was difficult to meet. At twenty-five knots speed the German boats passed like a flash through the British line. A great hump of water rose under the British cruiser Londonderry, second in the inverted order of the line, and she reeled and settled heavily in the water. A torpedo had struck her abaft the fore turret. Almost at the same instant another German torpedo division attacked the rear of the British line, and a German torpedo boat made a hit upon the Olympia, last but one in the British line.	The Olympia, struck squarely amidships, shuddered violently under the impact, her deck planks buckling and a dense cloud of steam and smoke rising from her shattered hull. The chaos was immediate, with sailors scrambling to control the damage while maintaining their stations. The German torpedo boats, having delivered their lethal cargo, sped away under cover of the confusion they had created, their engines at full throttle, disappearing into the mist of battle as quickly as they had emerged. On the British side, the immediate priority was damage control and maintaining formation despite the sudden and severe losses. The captain of the Londonderry, despite the severe list to the starboard side caused by the flooding, issued orders to counter-flood and stabilize the ship as much as possible. Crew members fought valiantly against the inrush of seawater, sealing off bulkheads and shoring up damaged sections with whatever materials were at hand. Meanwhile, the Olympia's situation was dire. The torpedo had ignited a fire near the ammunition magazines, and the risk of a catastrophic explosion was imminent. The order to abandon ship was a	1906	1979.9904
But the main hungry stream flows up the valley along the Alte Wiese, with its gay shops on either side, past the great group of the Hotel Pupp and its dependances into the park like country beyond, stopping only at some of the town's many bakers' shops to buy the breakfast bread.

The doctors invariably prescribe special mixtures.and bakings, and the only way to follow a regime is to carry your bread always with you. This early morning stop at the bakery is, however, very agreeable.	The air is fresh and crisp, and the warmth from the ovens spills out into the street, mingling with the aroma of freshly baked loaves and pastries. The bakers, already busy since the earliest hours, greet the regulars by name, exchanging pleasantries and news of the day as they wrap the warm bread in paper. The scene is a lively one, with people from all walks of life converging in these small hubs of community life. As you continue your walk, the streets begin to fill with the sounds of a waking city. The clip-clop of horses' hooves on cobblestones, the distant calls of vendors setting up their market stalls, and the melodious chimes of the church bell contribute to the symphony of morning activities. The architecture of the buildings along the Alte Wiese adds to the charm, with their ornate facades and colorful shopfronts inviting passersby to glance at their wares. Beyond the commercial bustle, the park-like expanses offer a tranquil retreat. Here, the pace slows, and the environment	1913	1988.1785
Unhappily, no definite constructive educational work had preceded this awakening. The people and the statesmen beheld the peril. Investigations followed, proving conditions to be far worse than had been claimed. Warning words were uttered, but in the absence of a preliminary constructive educational agitation and with no great constructive statesman with a vision to impress the public mind, the storm subsided, and privilege, which for a time feared it would be unhorsed, soon again found itself securely in the saddle and possessed of greater confidence in its power to corrupt, capture and control government than it had heretofore entertained. And perhaps it will be well at this moment to call to mind some typical warning utterances given at this period by statesmen and jurists — warnings and prophecies the truth and significance of which have been since impressed on the consciousness of all intelligent patriots.	"Among these voices was that of Senator John Doe, who, in a fiery speech delivered on the Senate floor in 1908, declared: ""We stand at a crossroads. Either we heed the call to reform and steer our nation towards justice and equity, or we continue down the path of complacency and corruption, which will surely lead to the decay of our public institutions."" He implored his fellow lawmakers to enact legislation that would curb the excesses of monopolies and restore fairness to the economic system. Similarly, Justice Mary Smith of the Supreme Court, in a landmark opinion, wrote: ""The fabric of our society is woven from the thread of mutual trust and the common good. When the scales of justice are tipped not by the law but by gold, that fabric unravels, threatening the very foundations of our democracy."" Her words echoed through the halls of justice, urging a return to principles over profit. These warnings were supplemented by academic contributions, such as Professor Henry Roberts’ influential book, ""The Gilded Cage"", which analyzed the socio-economic impacts of unchecked corporate power and offered"	1911	1976.6044
"he replied grimly, "" smash or no smash ! I never was beaten yet when pushing my way through obstacles, and I'M too old a hand to be beaten now I"" However, he found he was beaten this time, for although he switched on the utmost power, it refused to give any evidence of its existence, and we had to rely on our neutral power in order to maintain our position in the air ; though, as events proved, we could not have fallen. The excitement and tension of the work had thrown M'Allister into a profuse perspiration ; and, as he stood moodily mopping his brow with his handkerchief, I heard him muttering and swearing softly to himself. His blood was evidently up, for he made another desperate attempt to get the 158  Areanal to move forward, wrenching his switches with angry jerks, but it all proved labour in vain. "" Well, what is to be done now, John ? "" I asked ; "" we have tried two courses without any effect !"" "" I would suggest, Professor, that we should go up higher, "" he replied, "" so as to enable us to try again from another altitude, then, perhaps, we may pass above the obstacle."""	"Reluctantly, I agreed to his proposal, knowing full well the risks it entailed with our power already proving unreliable. M'Allister adjusted the necessary controls, and slowly, the Arenal began its ascent. We watched the altimeter creep higher, the ground shrinking away beneath us into a vast mosaic of earthy colors.  As we ascended, the air grew colder, and a silence enveloped us, broken only by the occasional creaks and groans of the Arenal's strained machinery. Once we reached the desired altitude, M'Allister once again attempted to engage the forward propulsion systems. This time, there was a faint hum of machinery attempting to comply, a hopeful sign.  ""Come on, old girl,"" M'Allister murmured under his breath, his hands steady on the controls. For a moment, it seemed as though the Arenal might indeed push through whatever invisible barrier had halted us before. But then, the humming grew erratic, sputtered, and died. We were left hovering, motionless once more, high above the earth"	1911	1988.8477
The question was also raised how far the photographic method could be applied to determine the distribution of luminosity in the spectrum, the suggestion being that a relation could be established between the density of the negative and the visual effect. Other photographs of the spectra of the mercury vapour lamp, the helium tube, and the neon tube were also shown, reference being made to the work of M. Claude on these lamps. The use of such tubes for the detection of waves in wireless telegraphy was also mentioned, and the audience were given an opportunity of observing these lights through a spectroscope. The neon spectrum was distinguished by a very fine series of lines in the red and orange. It was suggested that possibly an approximately white light might be obtained by the combination of various line spectra; for example, the mercury vapour lamp and the neon tube.	This idea spurred further discussion on the potential for developing new types of lighting that could offer more natural color rendering than the sodium vapor lamps commonly in use at the time. The assembly debated the merits of such a technological advancement, considering the practical applications in street lighting and in environments where the true color rendition was crucial, such as in art studios and galleries. Further exploration into the helium spectrum revealed its potential for use in scientific instrumentation, particularly in spectroscopy for chemical analysis. The unique spectral lines of helium could be employed to identify the presence of specific elements in unknown substances, thus providing a powerful tool for researchers in both industrial and academic settings. The conversation then shifted to the technical challenges involved in accurately measuring the intensity distribution across these spectra. It was acknowledged that while photographic plates offered a direct and measurable way to capture spectral data, the nonlinear response of the photographic emulsion made quantitative analysis difficult. This led to discussions on the need for calibration procedures that could correlate the photographic density with actual luminosity levels. Advancements in photometric techniques were also touched upon, with some members suggesting the integration of newly developed photo	1912	2005.3546
And these young girls have been told about the intellectual and moral and financial value of woman — such tales as it never entered into the heart of man to conceive. The programme of these young women ft to be married upon their own terms. Men shall — so runs their scheme — work for their support — to that end giving up his freedom and putting himself under orders for many hours of the day; but they themselves must not be asked to give up any of their liberty to him, or to subordinate themselves to his interests 6r to obey him in anything. To obey a man would be to commit the unpardonable sin. It is not necessary in connexion with a movement which proceeds on the lines set out above any further to labour the point that there is in it an clement of mental disorder.	The proposition is self-evident. The unnatural reversal of roles, the demand for unilateral sacrifices, and the absolute refusal to adhere to the mutual dependencies that traditionally balanced the marital relationship, all point to a profound misunderstanding of both the nature of companionship and the inherent give-and-take of any successful human relationship. These young women, educated though they might be, seem to be advocating for a system that isolates rather than unites, that divides rather than blends.  The ideal of marriage, as understood for generations, has been one of partnership, where both individuals contribute to the welfare of the union in various capacities. This modern notion, which appears to champion absolute freedom and independence within the bounds of a marital tie, paradoxically chains the relationship to an unsustainable ideal, where one party perpetually owes and the other perpetually claims. This is not liberty; it is a subtle form of tyranny. Furthermore, the implications of such a stance on the broader societal fabric are deeply troubling. If the foundational relationships within society are based on domination rather than cooperation, what can be expected of the society that	1911	1975.1667
"The tears ran down his red face. "" Do you remember the agent for caskets that was here last spring?"" he asked, when he could control his merriment. ""Ye s, "" a d mitted the old lady, with mental reservations. "" Well, she was back here this morning, her mourning veil bobbed off, white trimmings, looking as chipper as a sparrow in May. She met Oliver Beasley and Berryman Agnew on the street. ""' Oh, Mr. Beasley, so glad to see you again, ' she says, ' and to find you looking so much better. It comforts me to know that you won't need your casket any time soon. But Mrs. Beasley didn't pay her instalment last month, nor this one either. I reckon she forgot it.' He chopped with the Frenzy of Madness "" All this time she was fumbling in her hand bag for something."	Oliver Beasley, who had turned a shade paler at the mention of his own casket, managed a nervous chuckle. 'Ah, well, I'll remind her tonight,' he stammered, trying to mask his discomfort. Berryman Agnew, ever the peacemaker, stepped in with a light-hearted comment. 'Let's hope that's the last reminder you'll need about caskets for many a year, Oliver!' His attempt to lighten the mood only partially succeeded. The agent, undeterred, finally pulled a small ledger from her bag. 'I just like to keep things up to date,' she said, flipping through the pages. 'It’s all about maintaining order, you understand.' Her tone was cheerful, but there was something unsettlingly methodical about the way she handled the ledger. The conversation ended shortly after, with promises from Oliver to settle the matter posthaste. As the agent walked away, her figure seemed to merge with the shadows of the early morning, leaving Oliver and Berryman slightly chilled despite the warm sun climbing higher in the sky	1913	1989.6923
"Suard accedes to both these requests: he welcomes Dr. Burney at Paris and introduces him to the Philosophers; at the same time he causes a rectification of Grosley's errors to be inserted in the Mercure, the avant coureur, and the Journal encycloptdique.1 The next letter of this series shows that Suard again paid a visit to England in the spring of 1773, when he found Garrick ill and incapable of acting. But he passed some happy moments in the country with him and his amiable wife, and, like de Chastellux, brought back to France a tender recollection of ""the beautiful weeping willow at Hampton."" When he wrote to his 1 See his letters of July 2nd and August 12th, 1770 (Boaden, vol. ii. pp."	362-363) Suard describes these visits with a touch of poetic sensibility, noting the charm of the English countryside and the warmth of the friendships he forged. He was particularly taken by the serene beauty of the willow tree under which he and Garrick had many a thoughtful conversation, its branches sweeping gracefully towards the tranquil waters of the Thames. This image, Suard wrote, would forever symbolize for him the deep and reflective nature of English scenic beauty and its capacity to inspire both art and friendship. Returning to France, Suard was eager to share these experiences with his intellectual circle. He spoke of Garrick’s theatrical genius, now temporarily dimmed by illness, with great admiration and affection. His accounts went beyond mere social or theatrical commentary, delving into the nuances of English cultural landscapes and the personal connections that they fostered. Through his eloquent recollections, Suard not only bridged the cultural divide between France and England but also brought a piece of the English aesthetic appreciation into the heart of French philosophical discourse.	1912	1968.3856
"Then it was as silent, as quiet, as deserted as one expects a desert to be; now it has become the scene of activity, of noise, of modern change. Automobiles ""chugged"" back and forth over the sandy roads; laden wagons moved to and fro; groups of men were busy here, there and yonder, clearing the sagebrush, cactus, and creosote bush from thousands of acres; smoke ascended in a score of places from fires where the brush was being burned; the white of tents glistened with frequency in the afternoon sun; and now and again the odours of cooking reached us from gang tents near the roads over which we passed. What is the secret of the change? Why all this abnormal activity? The West is rapidly waking up to the fact that there are few or no ""irreclaimable"" deserts. Where creosote bush, salt bush and sagebrush will grow, oranges, apples, pears, apricots, figs, almonds, and alfalfa will grow, if man's energy, guided by wisdom and knowledge, conveys water to the scene."	This realization has spurred on what is now known as the irrigation movement, a sweeping transformation that promises to turn these once-barren landscapes into fruitful oases. The federal government, along with private investors, has begun to see the potential profit and societal benefits of converting these arid lands through extensive irrigation projects. Canals are being dug, dams constructed, and intricate water systems established to distribute this life-giving resource across vast stretches of land previously deemed uninhabitable. The economic boom resulting from these efforts is palpable. Towns are springing up around these new agricultural hubs. Land values in these areas have skyrocketed as farmers flock to acquire plots to cultivate. The promise of a bountiful harvest has lured not only seasoned agrarians but also novices eager to partake in this agricultural renaissance. Schools, markets, and churches are being built, fostering new communities where there were none before. The landscape is dramatically changing, and with it, the fortunes of many. Indeed, the desert is blooming, driven by the indomitable spirit of progress and the ingenuity of those	1911	2005.937
The impression caused by General Garfield's suspicious caution in withholding his public denial until he had inspected the handwriting of the Morey letter, was confirmed by Abram S. Hewitt's positive affirmation in a public speech that the letter bore General Gars  324 field's genuine signature. These were convincing circumstances to us, and that they were convincing also to the public was painfully evident to General Garfield's friends. But General Garfield's managers in New York were not idle. The political necessity of discrediting the Morey letter in the public mind was a burden they could not shirk, whatever the cost; and under the leadership of Chester A. Arthur (their candidate for Vice presi dent), Judge Noah Davis of the Supreme Court of the State was induced to act.	Judge Davis, a figure of considerable legal stature and influence, was tasked with the delicate operation of examining the evidence surrounding the Morey letter and issuing a public statement on its authenticity. This move was critical, as the letter, which allegedly expressed Garfield's support for Chinese immigration, had the potential to alienate a significant portion of his voter base, particularly among the working class and labor unions who feared job competition. In a meticulously orchestrated public address, Judge Davis declared the letter a forgery. He cited discrepancies in the handwriting compared to authenticated samples of Garfield's writing, and inconsistencies in the language and style used in the letter. This declaration was pivotal and was immediately seized upon by Garfield's campaign, which circulated the judge’s findings widely through pamphlets, newspapers, and public speeches. Simultaneously, Garfield's campaign managers organized rallies and meetings where speakers highlighted his consistent legislative record on immigration and labor, reinforcing his alignment with the interests of American workers. They painted the letter as a desperate ploy by their opponents to smear Garfield's character and misrepresent his policies. This strategic	1911	2004.4609
LKADBEATER S OPOSSUM 107 Leadbeater's Opossum. Gymnobelideus lend beat eri. Fur soft and dense. brownish grey above, with a medial dusky streak on the nape and back; the under surfaces dull yellowish. Tail pale brown, lighter than the body. Head and body about five and a half inches, tail six and a half inches. Of this, the rarest of the Opossums, only three or four specimens have been captured, all from the scrub on the banks of the Bass River, in Victoria. Leadbeater's Opossum. Genus Dromicia. Fur thick and soft, rather woolly. Ears large and thin, almost naked. No flying membrane. Fingers and toes without broad terminal pads; fore claws short and obsolete; hind claws developed. Tail cylindrical, its base furry, the rest finely scaled, with short hairs, the extreme tip beneath roughened, naked and prehensile. Arboreal; phytophagous. 108 These little animals have the habit of curling themselves up in Dormouse fashion.	They are nocturnal, emerging at dusk to feed on a variety of leaves, flowers, and occasionally small fruits. Leadbeater's opossum is particularly drawn to the nectar and pollen of certain eucalyptus species, which not only provides nourishment but also plays a role in the pollination of these trees. During the day, they retreat to the hollows of trees or dense foliage to sleep, curling their bodies into a tight ball to conserve warmth and energy. The reproductive habits of Leadbeater's opossum are less documented due to their rarity and elusive nature. However, it is believed that they breed once a year, with females giving birth to one or two young after a gestation period that is relatively short. The young are extremely undeveloped at birth and continue their development in the mother's pouch, clinging to the teats for nourishment and safety. Conservation efforts for Leadbeater's opossum are crucial, as their habitat is threatened by logging, bushfires, and land clearing for agriculture. Preservation of their natural environment, along	1909	1998.3623
FOG UNDER WARM FRONTS. — Thermal conditions iound in airmasses separated by a warm front are ideal for the production of precipitation fog. In fact, most of the world's precipitation tog is associated with a warm front and its precipitation. The upper part of Figure 138 illustrates temperatures and temperature variations in airmasses on both sides of a warm front. In the warm air, the temperature decreases from 70F at the surface to 48 at 6000 feet; in the cold air, the temperature falls from 50F at the sea surface to 30 at 6000 feet. There is a difference of 18F to 22 F at each corresponding level between the two airmasses. Rain falling from clouds in the warm air must, at the level at which it pierces the frontal surface, be warmer than the cold air into which it falls. As the raindrops fall, they are cooled by contact with the cold air and by evaporation of some of their liquid.	The cooling effect of the raindrops on the surrounding air causes the air temperature to lower to near or below its dew point, resulting in the formation of fog. This type of fog can be quite dense and extensive, often persisting for many hours or even days as long as the conditions remain unchanged. The colder air beneath the warm front acts as a barrier, trapping the cooler, saturated air near the surface and preventing it from rising and dissipating. The lower part of Figure 138 shows a typical cross-section of a warm front, with the warm air mass sliding over the colder air mass. The slope of the front is generally shallow, which allows for a gradual and widespread area of precipitation ahead of the actual frontal boundary. This area of precipitation is where the greatest density of fog typically forms, stretching out for miles ahead of the advancing warm front. Navigational and transportation activities can be significantly impacted by this type of fog, as visibility is reduced to a few meters. It is essential for meteorological services to monitor these conditions closely and provide timely warnings to affected regions. The presence of precipitation fog also	1913	1985.0652
They are now putting the results of the deliberations of this Society into practice in the scheme of complete lighting units now being developed by the Company. The British Thomson houston Company also desire us to announce that they have organised an Illuminating Engineering Department to freely give expert assistance to architects, engineers, and contractors in the planning of illumination along the most approved and efficient lines. This department is capable of undertaking all kinds of illuminating engineering work from the home to the office, and from the shop to the largest interiors, depots, railway stations, assembly halls, auditoriums, c. The Illuminating Engineering Department of this Company have offices and engineers at Rugby, London, Manchester, and Sheffield. We have also received from the same firm a pamphlet dealing with the ' Care of the Eyes The development in late years of high candle power tungsten lamps and other light sources of high intrinsic brilliancy has made it imperative to protect the eyes from the light of bare lamps.	The pamphlet offers practical advice on the use of shades and diffusers which can mitigate the harshness of direct lighting, thereby reducing eye strain and increasing comfort in both work and leisure environments. It discusses various materials and designs that can be used to achieve optimal diffusion and how to position lighting fixtures to best advantage in different settings.  Moreover, the pamphlet emphasizes the importance of understanding the color temperature of light sources, as different temperatures can affect mood and visual acuity. It provides guidelines on selecting the appropriate color temperatures for various applications, from warm lights conducive to relaxation in residential settings, to cooler, brighter lights that enhance concentration in workplaces. Additionally, the British Thomson-Houston Company's pamphlet touches on the economic and energy efficiency aspects of modern lighting solutions. It explains how the latest advancements in lighting technology not only improve visual comfort but also contribute to energy savings and sustainability by reducing electricity consumption and extending the lifespan of lighting fixtures. This comprehensive approach ensures that clients receive not only the technical support necessary for implementing efficient lighting systems but also the knowledge to maintain optimal lighting conditions that safeguard vision and enhance the functionality	1912	2006.2083

And here cold light comes also into play in admirable fashion. I have been able to project insects at work as large as men without killing them, which would have happened if the quantity of warm light necessary to produce this result had been used. Thus several thousand persons can at one and the same time follow the daily life, so full of keen interest, of the insect world. 231 I think we may predict that some day we may, thanks to cold light, take part in watching real insect races, accompanied by the usual betting and the exclamations of thousands of excited spectators. The application of cold light to mov ing picture shows is of the highest importance.	It not only allows us to observe these minute creatures in their natural environment without disturbance, but also preserves the integrity of their delicate structures, which heat could easily damage. Furthermore, the use of cold light in cinematography extends beyond the realm of entomology. It enhances the quality of the images captured, providing clearer, more vivid colors and sharper details, thus bringing scenes to life with unprecedented realism. The potential for educational purposes is immense. Schools and universities could use this technology to provide their students with close-up views of not just insects, but cellular processes, microorganisms, and more, all in real time. This could revolutionize the teaching of biology, allowing students to observe phenomena that were previously visible only through the static images of textbooks. In the realm of entertainment, filmmakers could employ cold light to create more immersive and visually striking films, especially in genres that rely heavily on visual effects and detailed imagery. This would not only attract audiences with the allure of high-definition clarity but also reduce the heat discomfort that often accompanies packed theater settings. Moreover, the reduced heat emission is a significant advantage in preserving	1913	2003.5836
""" You are quite right in saying that, M'Allister, "" I answered ; "" it is, indeed, a grand and marvellous sight! I can assure you that when I have been observing the moon in its full and glowing splendour, it has often seemed to me the most exquisitely beautiful object I have ever looked upon ; yet now it appears far more beautiful than when seen through Jhe telescope !"" CHAPTER IV CLOSE TO THE MOON — I GIVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT WE were now moving at a comparatively slow speed, yet the size of the moon's disc was very rapidly expanding as we approached nearer and nearer to it."	"Its surface began to reveal details that were undetectable from Earth, even with the most powerful telescopes. The craters, mountains, and plains unfolded before us with astonishing clarity. The Sea of Tranquility lay spread out like a vast, silent desert, its borders sharply defined against the rugged lunar highlands. The towering peaks of the Apennine mountain range cast long, stark shadows across the lunar surface, a testament to their imposing height. As we drifted closer, the stark beauty of the moon's surface took on a surreal quality. The absence of atmosphere meant that the transitions from light to dark were abrupt and dramatic, with no twilight to soften the edges. Each crater's rim was sharply delineated, and the shadows within them were pitch black, swallowing light whole. ""I must say, M'Allister,"" I continued, my voice filled with awe, ""that each of these formations tells a story millions, if not billions, of years old. The moon's surface is like a grand historical record of the solar system's tumultuous past."" M'Allister nodded in agreement"	1911	2003.9111
"""It will be remembered that a few years ago, following the revelation of conditions in the Chicago packing houses by Mr. Sinclair, investigations were instituted which showed appalling and almost incredible conditions in food preserving industries. It was shown that diseased and tainted meats were doctored and sold to the people; that partially decomposed fruits and vegetables were similarly utilised; while it was further shown that the people were buying and consuming foods that were innocent of the meats or fruits supposed to compose the preparation. These and other revelations made clear the imperative necessity for anti fraud legislation that would compel the manufacturers to acquaint the people with the real composition of the foods they were offering on the market. ""In some instances it was claimed that the substitution of pumpkin and apple for berry pulp, of grass seed for fruit seeds, of colouring matter for the natural fruit colour, and of glucose for sugar, did no harm, as these things were not injurious, and most of them were as wdiolesome as the fruit that the compound claimed to be. ""Even if this were granted, however, it would not answer the charge of fraud."	The fundamental issue remained that consumers were being deliberately misled about what they were purchasing and consuming. The trust placed in product labels was being violated, undermining consumer confidence and the integrity of the market. It was not merely a matter of wholesomeness, but of honesty and transparency. Following these scandals, there was a public outcry for stricter regulations and oversight. This led to the enactment of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which sought to prohibit the interstate transport of adulterated or misbranded food and drugs. It mandated that certain substances had to be accurately listed on labels, and it laid the groundwork for the creation of what would later become the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Act represented a significant shift towards consumer protection in the United States. It recognized the right of consumers to be informed about the contents of their food and medicine, and it placed a legal obligation on manufacturers to meet these expectations. This legislation not only aimed to prevent the deceptions uncovered in the food preserving industries but also sought to restore public confidence in the American food supply by ensuring that products were safe, wholesome, and properly	1911	2003.5917
As regards units of light, I advocate the smallest obtainable, with due regard to maintenance expenses, cleaning, renewing mantles, c. Even in large termini, lamps should be reasonably small, and as closely spaced as the roof girders will admit — say about 50ft. apart — and at the requisite height to obtain the 10 to 1 variation. The authors' suggestion of lighting the columns of country stations might not be a success, owing to vibration. We find the hanging lamp, with ball point, satisfactory for mantle renewals, and we generally avoid rigidity.	The use of small, evenly spaced units allows for a more uniform distribution of light, reducing shadows and dark spots, which is crucial for safety and visibility in such environments. Moreover, the flexibility in adjusting the height and spacing of these lamps can be tailored to meet specific lighting requirements, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. For outdoor platforms, where exposure to elements can be harsh, the selection of robust and weather-resistant fixtures is essential. These should be capable of withstanding wind, rain, and thermal variations without compromising the light quality or fixture integrity. The introduction of LED technology has been particularly beneficial in this regard, offering long-lasting performance with minimal maintenance needs. Additionally, incorporating motion-sensor technology could optimize energy usage, activating lights only when presence is detected. This not only conserves energy but also extends the life of the lighting units. In conclusion, the strategic placement of small, durable light units, equipped with modern technology, can significantly improve the functionality and cost-effectiveness of lighting systems in railway environments. This approach not only ensures adequate illumination and safety but also contributes to the sustainability goals of the	1912	2004.4584
561 Bad Loyal Lighting. The lamp is incompletely covered by the reflector and shines in the eyes of the workman instead of illuminating the work. Good Local Lighting. The reflector completely screens the lamp from the eyes and concentrates the light on the work — where it is chiefly needed. THE best method of lighting a room naturally depends on the purpose to which it is put. A private house is rightly illuminated in a different way from an office, factory, shop, or schoolroom. Distribution of Illumination.	In a private residence, one aims for a soft, ambient light that creates a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere, often achieved through the use of table lamps, floor lamps, and wall sconces. These fixtures are placed strategically to highlight architectural features or artworks, while providing sufficient light for reading and other activities. For an office environment, the goal is to reduce eye strain and increase productivity. This is typically accomplished with a combination of overhead lighting and task lighting. Overhead lighting provides a general illumination, while task lighting focuses on specific workstations to ensure that employees have adequate light for their tasks without creating glare or shadows. In industrial settings such as factories, the lighting must be robust and efficient. High bay lighting fixtures are commonly used because they can illuminate large areas from a high ceiling position. These lights are powerful and designed to cover wide spaces evenly, ensuring that all work areas are well-lit to maintain safety and operational efficiency. Retail spaces require a lighting design that attracts customers, highlights merchandise, and influences purchasing behavior. Spotlights and track lighting are frequently used to accentuate products, while ambient lighting supports	1912	2005.768

Let directors and actors alike be swayed not by the transient applause of novelty, but by the enduring reverence for authenticity.

It is a curious oversight, as the continuation of Buffon's argument significantly clarifies his position on the variability and potential transformation of species over time. He discusses the limits and conditions under which such changes might occur, emphasizing environmental influences and the potential for certain traits to be enhanced or diminished over generations. This nuanced approach, while not fully embracing a modern understanding of evolution, certainly moves beyond a static view of nature.  Buffon's hesitancy to fully endorse transformational evolution reflects the scientific caution of his era, yet his observations on the variability within species, such as dogs, provided a groundwork that later naturalists and biologists could build upon. His acknowledgment of the influence of external conditions on the development and diversification of traits in animals shows a clear move towards an evolutionary perspective, even if he did not articulate it in the terms we use today.  Thus, when considering Buffon's contributions to evolutionary thought, it is essential to look beyond the selective quotations and examine the broader context of his writings. This allows for a more accurate appreciation of his position as a precursor to evolutionary theory,	1911	2007.2513
Yet, in spite of this shining programme, very, very few general students elected zoology and little glow of enthusiasm could be seen on the faces of those who did. Students in need of some biological knowledge for their later professional studies, and drifters from the nonscientific departments of the university in need of credits for graduation, were the chief constituency of the successive classes. Undoubtedly a few earnest men and women sought the course out of genuine desire for knowledge of the kind it was supposed to furnish. But how scattering these were I see as I look back in memory over the groups that came and went year by year. And were my efforts of no avail at all? Did nothing whatever lodge permanently and potently in the minds of those students?	Certainly, some seeds planted in those young minds must have taken root, albeit subtly and perhaps imperceptibly at the time. The spark of curiosity, once lit, can smolder unnoticed until the right conditions fan it into flame. Perhaps it was not during the lectures themselves but later, in some quiet moment of reflection or sudden encounter with nature, that the lessons bore fruit. It is the fate of the teacher to sow without always witnessing the harvest.  Moreover, the value of education, particularly in a field as rich and varied as zoology, should not be measured solely by immediate enthusiasm or the number of students declaring majors. Knowledge seeps slowly into the crevices of the mind, and its effects can be long-delaying and indirect. A concept or fact dismissed or overlooked during a semester might emerge years later as the cornerstone of a deeper understanding or a professional pursuit.  Thus, while the immediate response might have been disheartening, the true impact of those lectures on zoology might unfold across decades, in ways I could never have predicted. The role of an educator is, after	1911	1915.0625
These are mainly given in confirmation of the conclusions arrived at by the model tests, bat some new points are illustrated. 47. Figs. 22, 23 and 24 give the records of the fluctuations in the old and new 4 ft. channels after the damping of the gauge has been adjusted according to the general scheme of comparison with the models! The improvement from the old 4 ft. channel to the new one is very marked as is the improvement in the steadiness of the new channel on replacing the high pitch fan by the low pitch fan. The record given in Fig. 25 may be included in these latter comparisons and refers to the 2 ft. channel. It will be seen that the steadiness is much the same as that obtained in the new 4 ft. channel.	The results indicate a significant reduction in turbulence with the implementation of the new channel designs, especially when paired with the low pitch fan. This suggests that the modifications made to the channel geometry and fan configuration are effective in minimizing flow disturbances, which is crucial for precise measurements and analyses in fluid dynamics experiments. 48. The comparative data from Figs. 26 and 27, focusing on velocity profiles across different sections of the channels, further validate the effectiveness of the new design. These figures illustrate a more uniform flow distribution, particularly in the core regions of the channel, which is indicative of a well-developed, laminar flow regime. Such uniformity is essential for the accurate simulation of engineering applications and enhances the reliability of experimental outcomes. 49. Additionally, the pressure drop measurements recorded across the channels, as shown in Fig. 28, demonstrate a lower pressure gradient in the new 4 ft. channel compared to the old configuration. This reduction in pressure drop not only improves the energy efficiency of the system but also reduces mechanical stress on the experimental setup, thereby extending its operational lifespan. In conclusion, the	1912	2004.9137
The word is now in common use, even in the Viceroy's Council; but it is continually challenged. We are assured that India is not a nation but a continent; a congeries  of discordant races, languages, and religions; a geographical expression. Also, that in such a country the mass of the people must for ever remain outside any organised political or social movement, which movement indeed can only at the most affect what Lord Dufferin called a microscopic minority; and that the millions of Mahomedans remain detached from, or hostile to, the Nationalist agitation, so called. These objections, so often stated, may be briefly considered before I conclude. First, then, as to the depth and extent of the new political or social consciousness. It is ordinarily said, especially in England, that the Indian agitator and newspaper represent nobody but themselves. I do not think that in India today the heads of the Government would maintain this old position.	The spread of education, the increasing communication facilitated by railways and telegraphs, and the growing interaction through commerce and modern industry have all contributed to a more interconnected and politically aware populace. The rise of regional political conferences and the swelling ranks of the Indian National Congress attest to an emerging sense of shared interests and identities among diverse groups.  Moreover, the contention that the Indian masses remain untouched by political movements overlooks the significant role played by grassroots organizations in both rural and urban areas. These entities have been pivotal in mobilizing the populace around issues such as taxation, land rights, and civil liberties, thereby fostering a broader political engagement. As for the assertion regarding the detachment or hostility of the Mahomedans, it is true that communal identities have been and continue to be manipulated both by colonial policies and by internal factions. However, there have been numerous instances where common economic and political grievances have united Hindu and Muslim communities, challenging the narrative of inherent sectarian divide. The notion of India as merely a geographical expression fails to recognize the historical and cultural threads that, despite the diversity, weave a tapestry of connection across	1908	1983.8411
What is more, the miner dies not only in ones and twos, but in hundreds — as at Whitehaven. If only a few mineowners and shareholders and members of the Board of Trade could be 'bricked up in the next big mine fire, the precautionary measures necessary to prevent great loss of life in mines would soon be made compulsory. Until this happens I fear all our pleading and agitating will be useless. K. D. SCOTT. 9 ® » TITANIC MORALITY. To the Editor of THE FREEWOMAN.	Madam, The recent disaster of the Titanic not only calls for an examination of maritime safety practices but also exposes the dire need for a broader moral reckoning within our society. It seems that in our rush towards technological advancement and luxury, we have grievously neglected the basic human values of safety and responsibility. The lifeboats, which should have been abundant, were insufficient, and the prioritization of first-class passengers over others was not merely a failure of protocol but of humanity. The glaring discrepancies in survival rates among different classes aboard the Titanic are a stark reminder of our society's moral failings. Are we to accept a world where one's survival in the face of disaster is largely dictated by their economic status? This tragedy should serve as a wake-up call, urging us to introspect and realign our moral compasses. We must advocate for stringent safety regulations not as a matter of bureaucracy, but as a moral imperative. Every human life must be valued equally, and our safety practices should reflect this belief. Let the Titanic be a lesson in humility and humanity, reminding us that our responsibilities to each	1911	1988.9589

This approximation, while not entirely accurate, provides a reasonable estimate for practical purposes, especially in preliminary design stages where exact calculations are not yet crucial. It is important to remember that the distribution of shearing stress is not uniform across the web section due to the varying distances from the neutral axis. The closer to the neutral axis, the higher the shearing stress, leading to the maximum at the center. 73. In considering the design implications of these findings, engineers must ensure that the web of the beam is adequately designed to handle the highest shearing stresses at its center. This might involve selecting materials with higher shear strength, increasing the thickness of the web, or employing other reinforcement strategies to distribute the stresses more evenly. 74. Additionally, the implications for safety factors must be considered. Since the actual maximum shearing stress exceeds the average value used in some calculations, it is prudent to apply a safety factor that accounts for potential inaccuracies in the stress distribution model. This safety factor will help ensure that even in the worst-case scenario, the structural integrity of the beam is not compromised. 75. Finally,	1908	1997.7394
"I found I might be in Cayenne a month unless I again took the Sager sand, which had orders to touch in at St. Laurent, my destination, and two days later we entered the Maroni River. The Fagersand swung around point after point, often within fifty yards of the dense forest, where the great tentacled roots of the grignon trees and moeo moco bushes arched into the swampy river edge, while above the mangle trees the feathered palm tops bent gently to the trade - winds. At last a large clearing, and St. Laurent, with a few wharves poking into the river, came into view. Plunge! the anchor went to the muddy bottom of the Maroni, some French inspecting officers came aboard, and five deportes swung a lighter alongside for cattle. As the lighter loaded, shoved off, Transports landing the "" Fagersand's "" Cattle at St. Laurent  6 I slid down a rope and made the trip with four convicts — an Arab foreman, two Algerian blacks, and a blond youth.

As we conversed, the river lapped gently against the sides of the lighter, and the dense jungle seemed to listen in on our exchange. The two Algerian blacks, who had been quietly observing us, joined in, their voices adding to the harmony of our impromptu gathering. They spoke of their own distant homes, of the crowded markets and the bustling streets, each word painting a vivid picture of a land far away. The blond youth, however, remained silent, his gaze fixed on the passing shoreline. His story was a mystery, his past a closed book that perhaps no one would ever read.

"It is a fact that in Germany, if a man has a good character, if his honesty and thrift are so well established in his village that he is admitted to the co operative credit bank, he has only to produce a neighbour to go surety for him to obtain a loan for any provident purpose. As the leading man in one little village bank said: ""We know all about our members, even to what is in their closets. A good neighbour signing for him would have been more than sufficient."" A man may have a minimum of property and still have the source of financial help open to him on personal surety alone, through the wonderful avenue of cooperation. The Genossenschaft Kasse, or Cooperative Bank, is formed by a number of men who have come together to capture that elusive thing called credit."	Each member contributes a small amount to the collective pool, which then serves as the capital for granting loans to the members. The principle is simple: mutual trust and support. The bank operates under a democratic structure where each member has a say in the administration, and decisions are made collectively during meetings. This model ensures a level of transparency and accountability that traditional banking often lacks. Moreover, the success of these cooperative banks lies in their ability to evaluate a member's character and reliability, rather than focusing solely on collateral. This community-based approach allows members who might not qualify for traditional loans due to lack of tangible assets to access funds based on their reputation and trustworthiness within the group. As loans are repaid, the funds rotate, enabling other members to benefit in turn.  This method fosters a strong sense of community and mutual responsibility, as each member's success contributes to the stability and prosperity of the bank itself. It also encourages fiscal responsibility and discipline among the members, knowing that their actions directly affect their neighbors and friends. Such cooperative banks have been especially beneficial in rural areas where access to conventional	1913	2003.326

Multiplying this by sin w, and integrating, the lateral force is obtained in the form If this force acts not at the CG., but at a distance x„ in front of the CG., there will be a corresponding couple about Gz. The couple in the plane of rolling (about Gx) is «*^./'(^») y X sin m dQ where X is the perpendicular from the CG. on the normal to the element dQ. The lift dP will be accompanied by a drift n dP where p may be assumed constant to a first approximation: giving a couple in the plane of yaw (about Gz) — v'^.ftf '^) fy sin w dQ to which must be added the couple above due to z.	Thus, the overall dynamics of the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the aircraft can be extensively analyzed through these integral expressions. The calculation of the lift and the drift, along with the associated moments about different axes, provides a comprehensive understanding of the aircraft's behavior under varying conditions of flight. The significance of the location of the center of gravity (CG) in these calculations cannot be overstated. The position of the CG affects the magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic moments, which in turn influences the stability and control of the aircraft. By adjusting the CG position, pilots and engineers can manipulate the aircraft's response to control inputs and external disturbances. Furthermore, the factors such as the angle of attack (w) and the distribution of lift and pressure over the wing (dQ) are crucial in determining the overall aerodynamic characteristics. These variables are integral in designing wings and control surfaces that maximize performance while ensuring safety and stability during flight. In practical applications, these theoretical calculations must be validated with experimental data and real-world testing to account for complexities and irregularities that are not captured in simplified models.

3 and 4), and a locking device is provided to prevent rotation about a vertical axis. The balance is then only free to rotate about the two horizontal axes AiBt and AiCi of iFig. 6. Of these two axes, AiBi is along the wind direction, and is used for the measurement of lift or lateral force, whilst AiCi is at right angles to the wind, and may be used for determinations of drift. The couples about the axis AiCi are balanced mainly by weights attached to the end of the arm AiBi, and finally by movement of a jockey along the balance arm.	The balance arm itself is delicately calibrated to ensure precise measurements and adjustments. As the wind acts upon the object being tested, any lateral forces exerted by the wind result in a measurable deflection of the balance arm along the AiBi axis. This deflection is recorded and can be analyzed to determine the lift force acting on the object. Similarly, any drift forces, which act perpendicular to the wind direction, cause a rotation around the AiCi axis. These rotations are counteracted by the weights and the positioning of the jockey, which together maintain the balance in a neutral position. To enhance the accuracy of these measurements, the entire apparatus is typically mounted in a wind tunnel, where wind speed and direction can be tightly controlled. This setup allows for repeatable and reliable data collection, which is critical in aerodynamic testing. The data gathered from such experiments are vital for the design and optimization of various aerodynamic structures, such as aircraft wings, vehicle bodies, and even smaller components like sails or wind turbine blades. Moreover, the locking mechanism that restricts rotation about the vertical axis ensures that the balance	1912	1968.9032
"We hope to show at the same time that the problems of the day are just as much objects of science as any period of past history or any phase of primitive life. To the sociologist "" nothing that is human is foreign."" Not that such scattered fragments of Sociology are of real value for the science till they are brought or rather till they grow together. On the contrary it is one of the functions of Sociological criticism to prevent the crude use of fragments of history and of empirical generalisation from isolated cases. But the main problem of Sociology at the present day is to build up the great Comparative Science which alone can put the theory of social evolution on a firm basis."	For this purpose, it is imperative to collect data from various societies, both contemporary and historical, to analyze patterns, structures, and functions within these societies. The comparative method allows sociologists to discern similarities and differences across cultures, helping to identify universal social laws and the particularities that distinguish one society from another. By examining these diverse societal structures, we can better understand the underlying mechanisms that drive social change and development. Moreover, the integration of theoretical frameworks with empirical research is crucial. Theories must be tested against observed data to validate their accuracy and relevance. This iterative process enhances our understanding of social dynamics and ensures that sociological theory remains grounded in the realities of human behavior and social organization. Thus, the task of sociology is not merely to observe or to critique but to synthesize and build upon the existing knowledge to form a cohesive and comprehensive understanding of societal function and evolution. This endeavor requires a meticulous and disciplined approach, as the intricacies of social life are vast and complex. However, it is through this rigorous scientific inquiry that sociology can contribute effectively to addressing the pressing issues of our time, offering	1908	2007.1844

Because he wrought in the dark, should no light of the human day Shine through his toilsome years and the lot of his children at play ? Because he toiled unseen, while Death at his elbow stood, Should none think of the miner's grief or seek the miner's good In the homes where the fruits of his toil burn bright on the pleasant hearth, While he sweats and strives and strains in the deep, dark caverns of earth ?

Our reward was rich and immediate. While we discussed the things about us, making records with unobtrusive note books and deceptive - angle camera, our own appearance, actions, and mishaps were observed and commented upon, respectfully, but doubtless in the minutest detail, which often resulted in our wants being anticipated. We had left the Nile one cool morning early in the month in the state compartment of the train which runs twice weekly from owasla el wahat, on the main line, over the narrow gauge road which climbs over the Libyan plateau west of Luxor and old Thebes, by ancient belief the abode of the dead. But one green thing was seen before reaching the oasis of Kharga, and that was a willow - tree of a man's height, surrounded by a low, dried mud wall at a lone station midway of the journey.	The stark landscape beyond this singular greenery was a tapestry of endless sand and stone, undulating in the harsh sun, occasionally broken by the sharp silhouette of a distant mountain range. The train chugged laboriously, its wheels grinding against the narrow tracks, throwing up clouds of dust that settled like a fine veil over everything. The arid expanse seemed alien, yet imbued with a mystic tranquility that spoke of ages long past. Inside the compartment, the heat was stifling, making the outside wind, hot as it was, seem almost refreshing when it occasionally swept through the open windows. Our water supply was crucial, each drop a treasure, and we rationed it with care, knowing the oasis was still many hours away. As we approached Kharga, the landscape began to change subtly. Small, hardy shrubs and acacias started to appear, defiant in their survival. The oasis itself was a revelation—a sudden burst of lush greenery in the midst of barrenness, a vivid patchwork of date palms and olive trees, fed by ancient springs revered since phara	1913	1974.215

Drawing on extensive research, Haggard vividly reconstructs the turbulent period of the Hundred Years' War and provides a lucid interpretation of the political and social dynamics that shaped Joan's life and legacy. With a keen eye for detail, the author delves into the intrigues of the French court, the fervor of the battlefield, and the mystique of medieval spirituality that defined Joan's mission. In his characteristic narrative style, Haggard not only chronicles the events that led to Joan's emergence as a national heroine but also paints a broader picture of the national identity and collective psyche of France during the 15th century.

One of the chief causes of complaint in a Y.W. Home is the fact that the house is closed early, but surely it is only fit and proper that a young girl should have some sort of supervision. A girl who thinks she can come in and out of a house at any time of night soon loses her character, and character is the most precious thing in the world to a girl — if she once loses that, she has lost all. If a boarder wishes to be out late at night, she can make arrangements with the superintendent, and itihere need be no difficulty about extension, as the door will always be left open for her. Looking at this question from a health standpoint, girls who have to turn out early in the morning require a certain amount of sleep to fit them for their work. These restrictions may be rather galling to a woman of forty or fifty years of age, but I would point out to her that these Homes were never meant for her, but for the younger girl or woman, who needs the protection and care which the Young Women's Christian Association provides for her. A YWCA.	home serves as a safe haven, a place of moral guardianship and guidance which is essential during the formative years of a young woman's life. It is, therefore, quite understandable that certain regulations and curfews are put in place to foster an environment of discipline and order, conducive to the development of good habits and responsible behavior. This not only protects the individual but also maintains the reputation and integrity of the institution as a whole. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that these rules are not arbitrary but are designed with the best interests of the residents in mind. The early closing hours, for example, are intended to ensure that the young women get adequate rest, crucial for their physical and mental well-being, especially given the demands of modern work and educational commitments. It also minimizes the risks associated with late-night activities, thus safeguarding the young women from potential harm. In instances where late outings are necessary, the provision to arrange for late entry with the superintendent ensures flexibility, thus balancing the need for security with the realities of contemporary social engagements. This system of structured flexibility is key in providing	1911	1999.8616
Owing to the complexity of structure and the small amount of development work it is impossible to correlate the coal beds in one part of the field with those of other parts, even when the outcrops are not widely separated. The thicknesses of the beds often vary greatly within short distances along both the strike and the dip. In some places the evidence suggests that the irregularities in thickness are due to movements, the coal having been squeezed into great pockets of irregular shape. More  View taken from the Mouth of Charlotte Lake, looking toward a lobe of Martin River Glacier. 426  PUL roist, EXTENDING INTO BEKING LAKE. over, in some places there is a somewhat abrupt change from a bed of good coal of considerable thickness into coal of a much lower grade or into carbonaceous shale. In some places the movements have resulted in the coal being intimately mixed with the rocks of the roof and the floor.	This mixing not only complicates the mining process but also affects the quality of the coal extracted, often leading to a higher content of impurities in the coal, such as ash and sulfur. The geological history of the area has clearly played a significant role in shaping the characteristics of the coal beds. Differential rates of sedimentation, varying pressures during compaction, and the thermal maturity of the organic material all contribute to the heterogeneity observed in the coal seams. The challenges posed by these geological complexities are manifold. Miners must frequently adjust their extraction techniques and continually reassess the economic viability of working a particular seam. This often necessitates detailed and costly geological and geophysical surveys to better understand the subsurface conditions. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of the coal seams can lead to increased safety risks for the miners, as irregularities in the coal beds can lead to unexpected collapses or gas emissions. Given these challenges, it becomes imperative for mining operations to employ highly skilled geologists and engineers who can interpret the geological data accurately and design appropriate mining strategies. This expertise is crucial not only for optimizing the extraction process but	1911	1992.0078

It was curiously at first collected, unintentionally, for science by a "" Tiger "" Snake (Notechis sculatus), which was captured alive by Mr. C. Frost. He kept the snake in a bag for two days, and then Mr."	Spencer, upon examining the contents of the bag for scientific research, discovered the unexpected guest. The snake, evidently having ingested the frog prior to capture, had preserved it in a remarkably good condition, allowing for this serendipitous addition to the herpetological records. Further studies and expeditions were organized to Mount Baw Baw in hopes of finding more specimens of this elusive species.  Subsequent searches, however, proved challenging. The dense undergrowth and rugged terrain of Mount Baw Baw created considerable difficulties in locating the Philocryphus flavoguttatus in its natural habitat. Despite these obstacles, a small population was eventually found in a secluded wetland area, mostly hidden under fallen leaves and debris near a slow-moving stream.  This discovery provided critical insights into the ecology and behavior of the species. Observations revealed that the Philocryphus flavoguttatus is primarily nocturnal, emerging at dusk to feed on small insects and invertebrates. Its cryptic coloration and slow movements make it well-adapted to avoiding predators and blending into	1909	1956.4213
Camels? — you couldn't buy 'em at all. Dogs, cows — anything that could haul; bicycles — anything a man could ride; buggies and butchers' carts — anything on wheels: in a day or two Southern Cross was cleaned out. Before I managed to get away I saw a husky young chap take the Coolgardie trail with his outfit packed in his little boy's express cart. I saw a dozen fellows set out with wheelbarrows. I saw an old bloke push off with a baby carriage. I saw some chaps get away with barrels — a sort of axle through the centre, the man between the shafts, the outfit stowed away somehow inside. It was something like one hundred and twenty-five miles from Southern Cross to the old Coolgardie field, I reckon — sand and scrub and stony ground, dry country; and at first  AUSTRALIAN BYPATHS 851 nobody knew the water soaks.	The sun blazed down mercilessly, turning the track into a veritable furnace. The dust kicked up by the thousands of feet, hooves, and wheels mingled with the harsh desert air, making each breath a gritty challenge. Men, desperate and determined, pushed onwards, driven by the whisper of gold and the promise of fortune. It was an exodus fueled by hope and the raw, unbridled spirit of adventure. As they trudged along, the landscape changed gradually. The sparse vegetation offered little shade, and the relentless sun showed no mercy. Every now and then, a makeshift camp would appear where men gathered to share news, resources, and sometimes, their dwindling supplies of water. Tales of finds and failures circulated with equal fervor, feeding the fever that drove them onward. The nights offered little relief. The ground, baked hard by the sun, was an uncomfortable bed, and the chill that descended after dusk was a stark contrast to the day's heat.

Food (excluding dealers) 1,876 Of those employed in group 2 at least half, of those employed in group 4 nearly two thirds, are likely to approximate in position to the general labourers employed in group 3. As a matter of fact builders' labourers, as well as some carmen, and labourers employed in factories, continually take work in each others occupation, and there exists between them something like the trade mobility (though not the place mobility), postulated by the Ricardian School of Economists.	This fluidity within the labor market allows for a certain resilience in the face of economic shifts. For instance, when the construction sector experiences a downturn, many of its laborers can transition to dock work or factory jobs, thereby cushioning the blow to their individual financial stability and contributing to a more dynamic workforce. However, this does not negate the need for targeted training and re-skilling programs to better equip these workers for more specialized roles that may arise as industries evolve and new technologies are introduced. Moreover, the interchangeability of labor across these sectors highlights the underlying issue of undervaluation and the often precarious nature of such employment. These workers, while versatile, are frequently engaged in physically demanding jobs that offer little in terms of job security, benefits, or career progression. This is particularly evident in the disparities in wages and working conditions when compared to more specialized or higher-skilled positions. Efforts to address these challenges must therefore not only focus on enhancing mobility within the labor market but also on elevating the status and conditions of general laborers. This could involve the implementation of minimum wage laws, the	1908	2004.9965

This calculation allows us to determine the distribution of stress across the structural elements, ensuring that the steel is utilized efficiently and remains within safe operational limits. It is crucial that these calculations are accurate to prevent structural failure under load. Moving forward, the next step would be to evaluate the deflection of the beam under load, which is another critical factor in structural engineering. This involves calculating the moment of inertia and applying the bending equation: \[ \delta = \frac{5ql^4}{384EI} \] where \( q \) is the distributed load, \( l \) is the length of the beam, \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity, and \( I \) is the moment of inertia. This deflection must be within acceptable limits to ensure the structure does not experience excessive bending which could lead to discomfort, damage, or failure. Furthermore, it is essential to consider factors such as fatigue and potential buckling under compressive stress, especially in slender members. For buckling analysis, the critical load \( P_{cr} \) can be calculated using Euler's formula: 	1908	1991.9852
Mr. Willcox added that he was sorry not to be able to show some examples of indirect lighting with metallic filament lamps in printing shops. Such a system, however, had been very successfully employed — the well-known eye rest system and x ray reflectors. One of the very largest publishing houses in the United States, the Curtis Publishing Company, after a year's careful testing by a committee of five, decided on this eye rest system of lighting as the most desirable for their new building and offices. The points considered were (a) original cost, (6) cost of operation, (c) maintenance cost, (d) depreciation, (e) seeing efficiency and visual acuity. This was probably one of the largest installations ever made of one single type of lighting fixture. Equally good results were given by this indirect lighting system as with the indirect arc lighting, and the simplicity, general adaptability, and many advantages of metal filament lamps would make this system of lighting very widely used.	The committee found that the indirect lighting not only reduced glare significantly, thereby decreasing eye strain among workers, but also enhanced the overall ambiance of the work environment, making it more conducive to productivity. The metallic filament lamps used in this setup were praised for their longevity and lower heat emission, which further contributed to a comfortable working atmosphere.  Moreover, the uniform distribution of light eliminated shadows that often cause errors in typesetting and proofreading, crucial tasks in any publishing house. This aspect was particularly appreciated in areas where precise visual tasks were frequently performed. The adaptability of the system allowed for easy integration into various spaces without the need for extensive restructuring, a factor that significantly cut down on installation costs. As Mr. Willcox concluded his remarks, he emphasized the potential for this lighting technology to revolutionize workplace environments not only in printing shops but across various industries where visual acuity is paramount. The success of the Curtis Publishing Company's implementation had already begun to stir interest among other businesses, pointing towards a broader trend in adopting healthier, more efficient lighting solutions.	1912	2001.2908
The security given by a pension system is really the acquisition of a certain equity which will result in benefit to those who participate in it. Such a consideration, if rightly used, can be made to minister to the idea of thrift, not to break it down. In fact, the whole theory that possible destitution in old age is the prime cause of thrift seems to need revision. Hope, not fear, is the great moving power in humanity. To save so that the income will be a decent support seems to many, and these often in highly respectable callings, so hopeless a task that to undertake it unaided appears foolish, but with a living assured in old age there is an incentive to save in order that additional pleasures or greater advantages for others might then be possible.	The pension, therefore, does not remove the need for thrift; rather, it reinforces the reasons for engaging in it. It provides a base upon which individuals can build, knowing that their most basic needs in old age will be met. This security can encourage more strategic and long-term financial planning, as people are more willing to invest or save when they believe that their foundational needs are secured. Moreover, the presence of a pension system can improve the overall morale and productivity of workers. Knowing that their efforts during their working years contribute not only to immediate needs but also to their future stability can make individuals more committed and content in their roles. This, in turn, benefits society at large, as happier and more secure workers contribute to a more stable and prosperous economy. In essence, a well-structured pension system does not merely act as a safety net; it serves as a springboard for further financial prudence and planning, enhancing both individual and collective well-being.	1911	2002.2208
A long and careful investigation of fifteen years' records proved absolutely that not only had these canals never been seen before, but that they could not have existed. They are on a region which is frequently very favourably situated for observation, and could not possibly have been overlooked, for they are now the most conspicuous objects on that part of the planet. It is beyond question that they are not only new to us but new to Mars ! The two main canals run in a southeasterly direction from Syrtis Major, and with them are associated two smaller ones and at least two new oases ; while, from their inter connexion, they are all clearly parts of one and the same addition to the general canal system ; for they now fit in with the system as though they had always formed part of it.	This revelation has stirred the scientific community to its core, provoking a myriad of theories and speculations. Some suggest that these canals are the result of natural geological processes that have only recently become active, perhaps due to underground water reservoirs or shifts in the Martian crust. Others, more daring, propose the idea of intelligent intervention, hypothesizing that these structures could be the work of an advanced Martian civilization, engaged in a late effort to modify their planet's climate or geography. The implications of such findings are profound. If the canals are indeed artificial, it would not only prove the existence of Martian life, but also of a civilization capable of undertaking massive environmental engineering projects. This would necessitate a reevaluation of our understanding of life in the universe and spur an unprecedented effort in interplanetary communication and exploration. However, until more data is gathered, these theories remain speculative. Efforts are underway to direct the next generation of Mars orbiters to these locations, equipped with high-resolution imaging technology and subsurface radars. The scientific community awaits with bated breath for these missions, hoping	1911	1999.5651
The plain clothes of the reservists coming in were disposed of, no man daring to appear in the ranks unless in uniform, Von Kronhelm's proclamation having forbidden the tactics of the Boers of putting mere armed citizens into the field. horse collecting parties went out all over the country, taking with them head collars, head ropes, bits, reins, surcingles, numnahs, horse blankets, and nose bags. These scoured every county in search of likely animals. Every farm, every livery stable, every hunting box, all hound kennels, and private stables were visited, and a choice made. AH this, however, took time.	Meanwhile, the urgency of the situation pressed upon Von Kronhelm and his staff. The mobilization of the troops had to be swift to counter any advances by the enemy, and the lack of adequate transport could severely hamper their operational capabilities. The commandeering of horses was just one piece of a larger logistical puzzle that needed to be solved to ensure the army could move effectively and maintain supply lines. As the horse collecting parties continued their expeditions, reports came in of varying success. In some areas, the local populations were cooperative, perhaps swayed by a sense of duty or fear of reprisal. In others, resistance was encountered; farmers hid their best horses, and rumors of sabotage began to circulate. Von Kronhelm issued further orders to deal sternly with any acts of defiance, which only served to heighten tensions in those regions. Back at the headquarters, maps were spread out and routes planned. Telegraph lines buzzed with communications as officers coordinated the collection points and arranged for transport of the requisitioned horses to the nearest military depots. Veterinary corps were put on standby to inspect	1906	1957.9274
In this country where the Development Commission will presumably for many years be the main instigator and controller of agricultural research, the constitution of the advisory board, on which science is largely represented, forms a guarantee that broader counsels will prevail, and it is to be hoped that not merely this inception of the work, but its future administration also will be guided in the same spirit. So long as a train of inquiry continues to extend, and new knowledge, that most precious commodity, is coming in the enterprise will not be in vain and it will be usually worth while to pursue it. The relative value of the different parts of knowledge in their application to industry is almost impossible to estimate, and a line of work should not be abandoned until it leads to a dead end, or is lost in a desert of detail. We have, not only abroad, but also happily in this country, several private firms engaged in various industries — I may mention especially metallurgy, pharmacy and brewing — who have set an admirable example in this matter, instituting researches of a costly and elaborate nature, practically unlimited in scope, connected with the subjects of their several activities, conscious that it is only by men in close touch with the operations of the industry that the discoveries can be made, and well assured that they themselves will not go unrewarded.	These enterprises embody a vision where the dividends of scientific inquiry not only enhance the operational efficiency but also foster broader innovations that might reshape the industry standards altogether. Such a model of embedding research within the industry fabric ensures that the findings are immediately applicable, reducing the time from discovery to implementation, which is often a critical gap in more traditionally separated research settings. Moreover, the role of such private research endeavors can stimulate public entities to elevate their own efforts, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and advancement. It is imperative, therefore, that government bodies recognize and support these private initiatives, perhaps through incentives like tax breaks or grants, which can further encourage industries to invest in research. While the focus here has been on industries such as metallurgy, pharmacy, and brewing, this principle applies universally across all sectors. The integration of rigorous scientific research within industry not only propels the specific economic sectors but also contributes to the national economy by fostering an environment of continuous improvement and high standards. Conclusively, as we look to the future, the synergy between industrial ambition and scientific research will be pivotal in navigating the challenges of	1911	2004.6935
With various modifications, the list system of unanimous constit uency or proportional representation is in use for the election of the  Parliaments of Belgium, Sweden, and Finland, for that of the councils of about half the Cantons or States of Switzerland, and for that of town councils in Sweden, Switzerland, and elsewhere. Its adoption for parliamentary elections in France has already been voted by the Chamber of Deputies more than once, and it is expected to pass the Senate in the near future. President Poincare and ex premier Briand are among the supporters of the reform.	The system is praised for its ability to more accurately reflect the diversity of political opinions among the electorate, preventing the dominance of a single party and ensuring a fairer representation of minority groups. It is argued that this leads to a more stable and cooperative political environment, where compromise and consensus are necessary for governance. In contrast to the winner-take-all approach of many electoral systems, proportional representation allows for a distribution of seats that is more commensurate with the actual vote percentages received by each party. This has been seen to encourage the participation of smaller parties, leading to a richer political debate and a wider range of views being represented in legislative bodies. Moreover, countries like Germany and New Zealand, which have adopted mixed electoral systems incorporating elements of proportional representation, have also witnessed these benefits, fostering a political landscape where coalition governments often become the norm rather than the exception. This inclusivity in governance is seen as a strength, promoting a broader acceptance of the democratic process and its outcomes. Critics, however, argue that proportional representation can lead to fragmented parliaments with numerous small parties, making it difficult to	1914	1994.1177
"But when she saw Marcia clothed in a new Worth or Paquin. Sewell was sorely tempted to desert her elderly mistress and go in search of a young one. "" Come in, Sewell, "" cried Marcia. "" What do you think of it ?"" The woman eagerly obeyed her. Marcia's little maid Bellows did the honours, and the two experts, in an ecstasy, chattered the language of their craft, while Marcia, amid her shimmering white and pink, submitted good humoredly to being pulled about and twisted round, till, after endless final touches, she was at last pronounced the perfect thing. Then she ran across the passage to her mother's sitting room."	"""Mother, look!"" she exclaimed, twirling before the elderly woman seated by the window, her face alight with youthful excitement. Mrs. Dalton, her eyes reflecting a mix of amusement and pride, set her knitting aside and adjusted her glasses. ""My dear, you look absolutely splendid,"" she said, her voice warm with affection. Marcia beamed, the ruffles of her gown fluttering softly as she spun once more. ""Do you really think so? Sewell and Bellows have outdone themselves this time. I feel like a princess ready for a ball."" Her mother chuckled, her eyes following the graceful arcs of Marcia's movements. ""A princess indeed. Mr. Worth and Mme. Paquin would be proud to see how well you wear their art. But tell me, my dear, where is this royal ball to which you are so splendidly attired?"" Marcia paused, her cheeks coloring slightly.

As the afternoon waned and the sun sank, its level rays dwelled on the galleries of the palace which Peter the Cruel built himself and made so ugly with harsh brown stucco ornament that it set your teeth on edge, and with gigantic frescos exaggerated from the Italian, and very coarse and rank. It was this savage prince who invented much of the Alcazar in the soft Moorish taste; but in those hideous galleries he let his terrible nature loose, though as for that some say he was no crueller than certain other Spanish kings of that period. This is the notion of my unadvertised Encyclopaedia Britannica. and perhaps we ought to think of him leniently as Peter the Ferocious.	As the shadows lengthened and the light grew softer, the palace's stark lines seemed to blur and its severe façade took on a more melancholic air, reflective perhaps of its creator's own complex spirit. The harshness of the stucco and the bombast of the frescos, in the waning light, appeared less as an affront and more as a testament to a tumultuous era and a ruler's attempt to immortalize his reign through grandiosity and fear.  Walking through the now quiet corridors, where the echoes of the day's tourists had faded into a hushed reverence, one could almost hear the whispers of the past, the plotting of courtiers and the soft footsteps of a pageboy. Each room, with its heavy tapestries and dark, imposing woodwork, told a story of power and paranoia, a king who ruled with an iron fist yet yearned for the beauty and refinement of the Moorish designs he so fervently emulated. The Alcazar, for all its initial ugliness, held a strange beauty in the eyes of those who looked	1913	1986.5623
"Many other interesting items are included, and the work is produced in the best possible style. A Great Russian Realist: The Romance and Reality of Dostoieffsky. J. A. T. LLOYD.

Gogel was the founder of the Russian novel, and at the outset of his literary career Dostoieffsky was hailed as a new Gogel. The former wrote of Russia and the Russians as they appeared to him, the latter from the sad but never embittered memories of his youth."	"Dostoieffsky’s work, imbued with a deep psychological insight, plunges into the complexities of the human soul, unafraid to expose its darkest corners. His characters are not merely Russian men and women; they are universal figures, struggling with passions, guilt, redemption, and the existential burdens that define the human condition. His novels—such as ""Crime and Punishment,"" ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" and ""Notes from Underground""—are profound moral explorations that continue to resonate with readers worldwide. In ""A Great Russian Realist,"" Lloyd delves into the tumultuous life events that shaped Dostoieffsky's worldview and literary genius. From his early days in a poor family, through his arrest and near execution, to his final years as a revered but tormented writer, Lloyd paints a vivid picture of a man who transformed personal suffering into literary gold. Through meticulous research and thoughtful analysis, Lloyd not only highlights Dostoieffsky's contributions to literature but also his impact on the philosophical and cultural thought of his time and beyond.

"Might it not be possible to deal with them as other public nuisances — such, for example, as houses of ill fame ? "" What is the meaning of "" demoralising""? and who says so? What is the Standard of Morals ? What are the names of specific "" newspapers, magazines, and periodicals"" referred to ? Or are these phrases merely thrown out in order that such' shall be unearthed — by the police?"	Are we, then, to empower our constabulary to become arbiters of literary and journalistic content, to discern and act upon what they interpret as moral or immoral within the printed word? This notion treads perilously close to the edge of censorship, a slippery slope leading to the suppression of free speech and expression. It is imperative that we define these terms with the utmost clarity and care, lest we find ourselves entrapping innocent activities under vague and sweeping allegations. Moreover, the issue of enforcing such measures raises substantial concerns regarding the practicality and justness of policing morality through such a lens. The variability of moral standards, influenced by cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, makes it nearly impossible to establish a uniform standard that is fair and equitable across all segments of society. Instead of rushing to empower the police with such broad and potentially oppressive powers, it would be wiser to encourage public discourse and education on these matters. Let communities discuss and determine their own standards, supported by the guiding principles of harm reduction and mutual respect. This approach fosters a healthier, more democratic society where freedom of expression	1911	1987.456
So great an authority as Sir Charles Eliot, vice-chancellor of Sheffield University, who perhaps knows a greater variety of languages than any other man, from Portuguese to Russian, from Turkish to Japanese, languages of central Africa and of the Polynesian Islands, tells me that he considers that this progress favours thought. Gender, number, case hamper language, restrict its flexibility, impede thought. A monosyllabic root language, such as Chinese or Burmese, is a swifter and more precise solvent of thought than are the highly inflected Bantu tongues. If this be true — and it does not seem to me open to doubt — it is easier to think in English than in Latin. I have not the least doubt that it is easier for Sir Charles Eliot, Professor Hill or me to think in English than in Latin. The great educative value I assign to the study of Latin lies precisely therein.	It teaches us to handle a language of a structure so different from our own, that it compels us to stretch our minds to their utmost limits, to grapple with a syntax that does not yield readily to the English-speaking brain. This exercise in mental gymnastics strengthens our cognitive abilities, enhances our understanding of linguistic nuance, and deepens our appreciation for the intricacies of expression. Moreover, the study of Latin, with its rich lexicon and its precision in expression, enriches our vocabulary and refines our sense of language. It gives us a keener insight into the roots of many English words, and thus a better grasp of our own language. Furthermore, the rigorous logic required by Latin’s grammatical structure aids in the development of analytical skills. The necessity of understanding the exact role of each word in a sentence fosters a habit of thorough and precise thinking that is applicable far beyond the boundaries of linguistic studies. Indeed, many have found that the clarity of thought and expression which Latin demands is parallel to the clarity required in fields such as law, philosophy, and science. Thus,	1911	1960.2622
Now the secret was out! What we actually saw was this: not a single wide canal but a series of comparatively narrow canals, running parallel to each other, with a very wide strip of vegetation between each. Usually the canals were linked together in pairs by smaller cross canals running diagonally from one canal to the other in alternate order. These were the irrigation trenches. Thus from one of a pair of canals an irrigation trench would branch out at an angle of about fifty degrees, and enter the second canal. Higher up, on the same side, another trench would run from the second canal at a similar angle, and enter the first canal, and so on — ad infinitum.	This intricate network of waterways and vegetation created an astonishingly methodical pattern that was visible even from our distant observation points. The arrangement allowed for an efficient distribution of water resources, a vital component in the arid Martian environment. It was clear that whoever engineered this system had a sophisticated understanding of hydraulic management and landscape architecture. The canals themselves, while narrow, were remarkably straight and uniform in width, suggesting a level of precision in their construction that was almost beyond belief. The green strips, flourishing with robust plant life, contrasted starkly with the surrounding barren terrain, highlighting the effectiveness of this irrigation system. These verdant corridors served not only as agricultural havens but also as natural habitats for whatever forms of life might exist on the planet. The realization that we were looking at a deliberately designed agricultural infrastructure rather than natural geological formations changed our entire perspective on Martian civilization. It was a testament to the ingenuity and possibly the desperation of a society that needed to master its harsh environment to sustain itself. This discovery opened up a plethora of questions about the civilization that built these canals: their technological	1911	2006.262
"Something like this I apprehend to be the general nature of the contrast between the positive method and that which Comte calls metaphysical. Its essence seems to be in the point that to the "" metaphysical "" mind the concept has a certain value, validity or reality in itself, to the positive it has this value only as relating to an order of reality given in experience Two or three examples may illustrate the contrast. Comte's first specimen of a typically positive conception is the law of gravitation. This example is the more interesting because the same law is taken by Hegel as typical of the law which becomes 1. If it be objected that reality is a wider conception than experience whether actual or possible, it may be replied that the basis and meaning of any conception of such reality are on the positive theory found in experience alone. void in becoming general The very charge of nullity which positive method makes against the metaphysicians is urged by the great metaphysician against the chosen type of the positive method."	Comte would argue that the law of gravitation, as derived empirically from observed phenomena, provides a practical and observable framework for predicting and understanding the motions of celestial and terrestrial bodies. It is through the systematic observation and quantification of these motions that the law holds its significance. The law does not possess inherent truth outside of its utility in organizing and explaining the patterns seen in nature. In contrast, Hegel's perspective, deeply rooted in his dialectical method, sees the law of gravitation as an abstraction that loses its concrete reality as it is generalized. To Hegel, the universal law abstracts from the particularities and specificities of individual phenomena, thus detaching from the rich, dynamic process of reality itself. In another example, consider the concept of causality. To the metaphysical thinker, causality might be viewed as an essential, inherent link between events, a principle that exists independently of the observable interactions. It is a deeper truth that governs the universe, often entwined with notions of necessity or even divine providence. For the positivist, however, causality	1908	1998.9711

To further describe the chaotic state of England occasioned by the terrible and bloody war would serve no purpose. The loss and suffering which it had caused the country had been incalculable ; statisticians estimated that in one month of hostilities it had amounted to £500,000,000, a part of which represented money transferred from British pockets to German, as the enemy had carried off some of the securities upon which the German troops had laid their hands in London. Let us for a moment take a retrospective glance.	The conflict, sparked by a series of diplomatic failures and international tensions, had escalated rapidly, sweeping across Europe with England at the forefront of the hostilities. It was a modern war, characterized not only by the advancement of military technology but also by the total mobilization of national resources and economies. The home front was as crucial as the battle lines drawn across foreign soils. Cities had been transformed into industrial hubs for war production, churning out munitions and supplies at unprecedented rates. Women, in the absence of men who had gone to fight, stepped into roles that challenged pre-war societal norms, working in factories, driving ambulances, and serving in auxiliary military capacities. This not only shifted the demographic workforce but also began to alter gender dynamics, planting seeds for future social change. However, the war's toll was heavy. The landscape of Europe was marred by trenches and craters, villages were turned to rubble, and countless lives were lost on both sides. The psychological impact on those who returned was profound, with many suffering from what was then called shell shock, struggling to reintegrate into	1906	1999.9249
"Just as he had settled himself again in his armchair and had taken up a book, a peculiar sound made him pause — the sound of feet approaching his study door. He frowned; it was the youngsters, no doubt, but how odd that they should seek him here! This was a sacred retreat, which no one entered unless by special invitation. He sighed, recollecting one person who had always come, even when she had not been invited. He made a reluctant movement as if to rise; he would intercept the children and take them back to the nursery. At this moment a timid knock at the door told the judge that he was too late in his intention. "" Come in, "" he called out, rather ungraciously. Three figures immediately made their appearance, the figures those of the children. They looked frightened, though quite determined."	"The eldest, a girl of about ten, stepped forward, her two younger brothers flanking her sides. She held a crumpled piece of paper in her hand, which she extended towards the judge with a mixture of reverence and resolve.  ""Sir,"" she began, her voice quivering slightly, ""we didn’t mean to disturb you, but we found something and we think it's important."" The judge, his expression softening, took the paper from her small, trembling hand and unfolded it carefully. His eyes scanned the contents quickly at first, then more slowly, absorbing every word. The room was silent except for the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner. ""What is this?"" the judge asked, his voice tinged with curiosity rather than irritation now. ""It's a letter, sir,"" the girl replied. ""We found it hidden in the attic, behind the old portrait of Grandfather. It looks very old."" The judge adjusted his glasses and read the letter again, more carefully this time. The handwriting was indeed old, elegant but faded, speaking of times long past"	1913	1941.4376
If there is a distinct and fundamental opposition, then it may be granted that it did not at once emerge into clear consciousness, and that the mind felt the distinction dimly and obscurely long before it became clearly aware of the distinction. The early history of religion will then be concerned with tracing the way in which the confusion of primitive thought was dissipated. But if magic is religion and religion is magic, then primitive man saw or felt from the beginning the truth — a truth which, though seen by some modern thinkers, is considered by most to be no truth but a wild confusion. If primitive man, so far from being guilty of confusion of thought on this point, was right in feeling the identity of magic with religion, then the continued struggle of religion to assert a difference between magic and religion has been a movement of error, of retrogression, not of progress: the fundamental identity of magic and religion is a fact — and Dr. Frazer is wrong in maintaining that there is a fundamental opposition between them. (4) The connexion of magic with religion seems, however, in some cases clearly to be that a relation of opposition exists between them.	Historically, many societies have drawn a line between their religious practices and what they consider to be magic. Religion, often organized and structured, relies on a communal understanding and worship of a divine power or powers, and is integrated into the moral and ethical fabric of a community. Magic, on the other hand, is frequently seen as an individual's attempt to manipulate supernatural forces to personal ends, often using secretive or esoteric means. This distinction is evident in the way religious leaders and texts frequently denounce magic as heretical or diabolical. Yet, the boundaries between magic and religion can be fluid. Both involve rituals, symbols, and the belief in unseen forces that can influence the material world. Both seek to bring about change: religion often petitions a higher power for intervention through prayer, while magic attempts to harness that power directly. In early human history, the same practices could be interpreted as either religious or magical depending on the context or the observer’s beliefs. This duality suggests that the relationship between magic and religion is complex. It could be argued that the distinction between them grew sharper as societies	1908	2002.7258
A man mounted the Tindal statue and harangued the crowd, urging the people to rise and compel the Government to stop the war. A few young men endeavoured to load the old Crimean cannon in front of the Shire Hall, but found it clogged with rust and useless. People fled from the villa residences in Brentwood Road into the town for safety, now that the enemy were upon them. The banks in High Street were being barricaded, and the stores still remaining in the various grocers' shops, Luckin Smith's, Martin's, Cramphorn's, ; and Pearke's, were rapidly being concealed from the invaders. All the ambulance wagons entering the] town were filled with wounded, although as many as possible were sent  south by train. By one o'clock in the morning, however, most of the civilian inhabitants had fled.	The streets, once bustling with the daily throngs of commerce and conversation, were now eerily silent, save for the occasional rumble of military vehicles and the distant thud of artillery. The air was thick with tension, a palpable cloud of fear and uncertainty that hung over the town like a shroud.  In the town square, where the statue of Tindal stood as a silent sentinel, the remaining townsfolk gathered, a motley assembly of the old, the infirm, and those too stubborn or too brave to flee. Their faces were etched with worry, eyes darting nervously at every sound. Among them, a group of local leaders and a few off-duty soldiers were making hurried plans for a defense, however futile it might seem against the advancing enemy. The local constabulary, aided by volunteers, patrolled the barricades, their movements sharp and fraught with urgency. makeshift fortifications had been erected at key points, and sandbags were piled high against the doors and windows of the town hall and other strategic buildings.

By 1 p.m.. the gradient for NORTHWEST. winds had changed to one for NORTH northwest. winds and by 6 p.m.. to N. The wind at 0-5 km. was identical with the gradient value at 7 a.m.. but showed no veer by 1 p.m.. and had dropped somewhat in intensity, whereas the gradient velocity had freshened from 16 ms. at 7 a.m.. to 20 ms. at 1 p.m.. By 4 p.m.. the wind at 0-5 km.	had slightly increased again, aligning more closely with the gradient conditions, which showed a steady increase to 22 ms. Observations indicated that the wind at higher altitudes was also intensifying, suggesting a deepening pressure system moving into the area. The barometric pressure readings confirmed this, showing a steady decrease throughout the day, which is consistent with the approach of a more vigorous weather system. By 6 p.m., the wind had shifted to a more northerly direction, aligning perfectly with the gradient predictions, and reached a peak velocity of 24 ms. This shift and increase in wind speed were accompanied by a noticeable drop in temperature and a rapid build-up of cloud cover, indicating the likely onset of precipitation. Remarks for the day concluded with the expectation of continued strong winds overnight and the potential for heavy rain or storm conditions as the system moved through. The rapid changes in wind direction and velocity throughout the day underscored the dynamic nature of the atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and readiness to update forecasts as new data becomes available.	1912	1980.0677
"They seek to declare what is reasonable and lay down the rules which are to justify thought or action. In this sense moral philosophy is never wholly positive; yet, in so far as it acquires scientific character, it involves methods of genuinely positive character, for example, the analysis and comparison of moral judgments, and its first principle stands the test of experience, viz., in the practical consistency with which it is capable of being applied and the working harmony which it can give to personal and social life. What more a normative discipline involves is too large a question for incidental discussion. But it may be remarked that not the least condition of ""positivity "" in moral inquiries is the very fact that the positive and normative are distinguished, and not fused as they are in the conception of the "" natural."""	Thus, moral philosophy, while navigating the realms of ought rather than is, strives to erect standards that transcend mere subjective preference by rooting itself in the broader human context. The task is to construct a framework that not only withstands the scrutiny of logical analysis but also resonates with the intuitive moral sentiments of individuals across diverse cultures and historical periods. This endeavor requires a delicate balance between the universal and the particular, between prescriptive norms and descriptive realities. Moreover, the evolution of moral philosophy reflects an ongoing dialogue between tradition and innovation. Historical insights and contemporary challenges both play critical roles in shaping ethical thought. As societies evolve, so too must the ethical frameworks that guide them, ensuring relevance and responsiveness to changing conditions. This dynamic process underscores the adaptability and resilience of moral philosophy, highlighting its capacity to address both timeless dilemmas and emergent concerns. In integrating both normative and positive aspects, moral philosophy does not merely catalog moral intuitions or cultural practices; rather, it seeks to refine and justify them. Through rigorous debate and reasoned argument, it aims to articulate principles that are not only logically coherent but	1908	2005.9792
It is thus that licopodium, dear to the fabricators of lightning, made its first appearance on the English 1 Letter of June 16th, 1765; Boaden, vol. ii. p. 441. Before 1765 Drury-Lane was lit chiefly by great wooden frames filled with candles and hung in the middle of the hall. Mrs. Parsons (Garrick (Mid his Circle, p. 92) makes allusion to the print which we reproduce on page 119 to prove that footlights were not imported from France in 1765. It is true that the line of lights existed, but it was composed of candles ; the snuffer was a well-known servant of the theatre. Garrick substituted the oil lamps which Monnet sent him.	This innovation was a significant step forward in the evolution of theatrical lighting, as it allowed for more control and subtlety in illuminating the stage. The oil lamps provided a steadier, more reliable light compared to the flickering candles, which were prone to drafts and sudden gusts. This change dramatically enhanced the visibility of the actors and the overall aesthetic of the performance. Garrick, always keen on improving the theatrical experience, embraced this technology eagerly. His correspondence with Monnet reveals his excitement and anticipation for the lamps' arrival and installation. The oil lamps not only improved the quality of lighting but also reduced the risk of fire, which was a constant threat in theaters of that era. As the oil lamps took their place along the footlights, they cast a warm, steady glow across the stage, enabling Garrick to experiment with effects of light and shadow that were previously impossible. This advancement in stage lighting marked a pivotal moment in theatre history, setting the stage for further innovations and enhancing the dramatic possibilities of theatrical productions.	1912	1984.3351

Includes the greater number of the Australian skinks. Lygosoma. '2. No movable eyelid, a transparent disc covering the eye. Ablepharus. B. Tympanum superficial and exposed. Tropidophorus. 243 Lack of space will not allow us to give complete diagnostic descriptions of the Australian Skinks, for these number over one hundred species.	However, we can highlight a few notable species within this diverse group. The Eastern Blue-tongued Lizard, Tiliqua scincoides, is perhaps one of the most recognizable, with its distinctive blue tongue used as a defense mechanism to ward off predators. This species, along with others in the genus Tiliqua, are known for their robust bodies and relatively large size compared to other skinks. Another interesting member of the Australian skinks is the Shingleback, Tiliqua rugosa. This species is unique for its heavily armored body and tail that resembles its head, possibly serving as a deterrent against predators. The Shingleback is also known for its monogamous behavior, a rarity among lizards. In the genus Lygosoma, the Common Garden Skink, Lygosoma quoyii, is widespread and often encountered in suburban gardens where it hunts for insects. Despite its small size, this skink is agile and quick, making it a successful suburban dweller. The genus Ablepharus, known for lacking movable eyelids, includes species like the Snake	1909	2007.2944
It is so small as to be seen with difficulty with the unaided eye. In severe attacks old trees put forth but little growth, new shoots often wither and drop in May, the leaves turn yellow and the fruit prematurely ripens in midsummer and falls off. Its presence is also indicated by the honey dew which is excreted by the insect in large quantities so as to cover the tree and even the vegetation under it. In this sweet solution a kind of fungus soon starts and smears the tree with a blackish coating. The mature insects pass the winter hidden in crevices under the loosened bark on the trunks and limbs of pear trees. During warm days they crawl about. In the first warm days of spring the egg laying season begins. The eggs are laid in creases in the bark and in the old leaf scars.	As the temperatures rise, these eggs hatch into tiny nymphs, which immediately begin feeding on the sap of the tree. This early stage is critical, as the nymphs are voracious and can quickly sap the strength of even robust trees. The nymphs go through several molts, shedding their exoskeletons and growing larger with each stage. By midsummer, they reach maturity and are fully grown adults, ready to reproduce and continue the cycle. The damage inflicted by these insects is not merely superficial. By extracting sap, the vital fluid of the tree, they deprive it of essential nutrients and water. This stress can lead to a reduction in fruit production and can compromise the overall health of the tree, making it more susceptible to other pests and diseases. Furthermore, the sticky honeydew excreted by the insects promotes the growth of sooty mold, which, while not directly harmful to the tree, blocks sunlight from reaching the leaves, thereby inhibiting photosynthesis and further weakening the tree. Control measures include the application of horticultural oils or insecticidal soaps which	1914	1986.503
"On the other hand, the very fact that London and the eastern counties thus held together "" polarised "" the war — if I may use that metaphor. The very fact that Charles could not attempt London and the east compelled him to rely upon the west. The west was not wholly his by any means; at the very beginning of the wars we have Worcester, cutting the Severn Valley right in two, garrisoned by the Parliament: at its critical turning point Gloucester on the same side is decisive. Any one making a map of the places both defensible and openjwhich, in the first months   of the war, were gainsaid by Royalist or Parliamentary forces, and marking the one in red and the other in blue, would find that he had a parti coloured pattern everywhere save in London and the adherent counties which I have mentioned; but he would find the King's colour predominating on the Upper Thames, upon either bank of the Severn and north of Trent."	This pattern of control, with its stark division of loyalties, set the stage for much of the strategic maneuvering throughout the conflict. The Parliamentarians, using London as their stronghold, could exert control over vital trade routes and maintain a steady flow of resources and reinforcements. The city's robust defenses and substantial population provided a significant advantage, discouraging any direct assault from Royalist forces. Meanwhile, the Royalists, centered in the west and north, found themselves frequently hampered by their inability to secure a unified front. Their control over the rural hinterlands, while advantageous for gathering supplies and conducting guerrilla warfare, often lacked the strategic depth provided by major urban centers. The Severn Valley, in particular, became a crucial battleground, where control shifted back and forth as each side attempted to dominate this key artery of movement and supply. As the war progressed, the importance of these strategic locations only intensified. The Parliamentarians fortified their positions in the east, constructing extensive networks of outposts and defensive works, while the Royalists, ever reliant on the loyalty of the western counties, were forced into	1912	1978.8461
It had a greater displacement than No. 23, but was more heavily loaded to bring it to the same immersion. Its most obviouB defect was a certain slowness in rising to the planing position, but the loading was a heavy one for the speed of the experiment. It was found that the lip could be dispensed with, if the angle between the water and the bow line of the float were reduced, and this has been done in all the later models, as will be seen in the table. 10. Varying load with a given float. — Pig.	24 illustrates the effect of varying the load on a single float design. This float, originally designed for a medium load, was tested under three different loading conditions: light, medium, and heavy. The corresponding changes in the dynamics of the float were significant. Under light loading, the float exhibited excellent stability and quick responsiveness to changes in direction. However, as the load increased to medium, while still maintaining satisfactory stability, there was a noticeable decrease in maneuverability. With the heavy load, the float struggled to maintain its planing position efficiently, showing a marked increase in drag and a reduction in overall speed. The experiments clearly demonstrated the importance of optimizing float design according to the expected load conditions. Adjustments in the distribution of weight and modifications to the hull shape were necessary to counteract the effects of increased load. This led to the development of adaptive design strategies, where the geometry of the float could be adjusted dynamically according to the load it carried. These innovations proved crucial in enhancing the performance of marine vessels, particularly those used in varying operational contexts where load conditions could change significantly. 	1912	1983.5544
"Extensive results of the same kind have been published by Bauschinger1 and by Sir B. Baker 1 for iron and steel. A few results are quoted for various irons and steels in Table III. These are selected from more extensive tables to be found in Unvvin's "" Testing of Materials, "" all except the first being from Bauschinger's experiments. The stresses stated in tonnes per square inch are those which the metals withstood for over two million times before fracture. Table III. shows that the "" complete reversal "" limit of stress varies from about \ in harder steels to f in the most ductile irons and steels, of the ultimate statical strength of the material. Also that the repetition limit varies from 40 to 60 percent. of the ultimate strength, being between 55 and 60 percent. for the ductile irons and mild steels. Further, that the reversal and repetition limits in the high tenacity steels (high carbon values) are higher than in the milder and more ductile material, although not so large a proportion of the ultimate statical strengths. 1 See summaries in Unwin's ""Testing of Materials, "" and in Brit."	ish Association Reports. The importance of these findings cannot be overstated for engineering applications, particularly in structural design and machinery where cyclic stress and fatigue are critical factors. The ability of a material to withstand repeated loading without failure is crucial for the safety and durability of structures like bridges, buildings, and automotive components. The concept of fatigue limit, or endurance limit, which these tables illustrate, is particularly significant. This is the stress level below which a material can theoretically withstand an infinite number of stress cycles without failing. Engineers use this data to design components that operate safely within these limits, ensuring longevity and reliability. Moreover, the differences in behavior between various types of iron and steel underscore the necessity of selecting the appropriate material based on specific application requirements. For instance, high tenacity steels might be preferred in applications where higher strength is required and the load conditions involve significant stress reversals. It is also important to note that these experimental results provide a foundation for developing predictive models of material behavior under cyclic loading. These models are essential for advanced computational simulations used in design and analysis, allowing engineers to predict how new materials	1908	2004.5326
It will therefore be less sensitive to disturbance. 13. To verify this and get the best position of spar, several sets of wings were made with the spar at various distances from the leading edge. It was then found that nearly all automatic movement of the lever could be avoided, and, alternatively, any required degree of such movement could be obtained. Trial in the air led to the selection of the present position of this spar. 252 When there is no automatic movement at all, the aeroplane is extremely easily controlled, and is light to the hand in bad winds, but the pressures on the two wings are not so well equalised, and therefore the aeroplane rolls more. In the position adopted, the gusts give indication of their presence, and as before tend to initiate a slight warp movement of the lever which gives, as it were, a hint to the flier to continue that movement if the gust should continue to increase. Work on Righting Moments and Fin Disposition.	14. The disposition and sizing of the fins and tailplane have also undergone extensive experimentation to optimize the righting moments. These components are crucial in stabilizing the aircraft laterally and longitudinally. By adjusting the size and angle of the fins, and the position and size of the tailplane, it was possible to enhance the aircraft's ability to self-correct when subjected to rolling motions and pitching. 15. The fins, particularly, were adjusted to provide the necessary yaw stability, which is essential for keeping the aircraft aligned with the intended flight path. Various configurations were trialed, including different fin shapes and sizes, to determine the most effective design that offers the best compromise between stability and control responsiveness. 16. Additionally, the effectiveness of the tailplane was evaluated by altering its area and the angle of incidence. These changes aimed to refine the pitch damping characteristics, thus improving the aircraft's behavior during turbulence and when making pitch maneuvers. 17. Through these adjustments, a configuration was eventually identified that not only minimized the need for pilot input but also enhanced the natural stability of the aircraft. This setup allows the	1912	1993.0267
"Are you going to stop me, Jan Smuts, when my father's first wife refused to marry your grandfather because he was bald? Are you going to dictate to me, you who would never have been born at all if my father's first wife had not refused to marry your grandfather? Answer me that, Jan Smuts!"" exclaimed the old gentleman, who was rapidly working himself into a condition of violent agitation. What Jan Smuts would have answered is doubtful, for at that moment her feminine intuition informed Tant' Anna that the psychological moment had come. Ambling forward, she flung her arms round Uncle Piet's neck and bestowed a resonant kiss upon his cheek. ""Welcome, Oom Piet!"" she exclaimed. "" Don'T you remember me, uncle ?"" "" Why — why — this must be little Anna!"" exclaimed the old gentleman, holding her off at arm's - length and scrutinising her thoughtfully. The result of his examination proving satisfactory, he kissed her in turn."	"""Indeed, it is I, Uncle Piet! Oh, how the years have flown!"" Anna said, her voice tinged with a warmth that seemed to melt away the remnants of tension in the air. Uncle Piet chuckled, the lines of his face softening into a smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes. ""My, my, how you've grown! Last I remember, you were knee-high to a grasshopper, always chasing the chickens back into their coop."" The room filled with laughter, the earlier confrontation with Jan Smuts dissipating like morning mist under the sun's embrace. Jan himself, unable to hold a grudge in such a light-hearted atmosphere, joined in the laughter, his earlier ire forgotten.

"Wylie furnishes a list of 925 solar and 574 lunar eclipses, extracted from Chinese works, observed between 2150 b.c. and a.d.. 1785. The earliest known record of an eclipse occurs, though imperfectly, in the ancient "" Shu king, "" or "" Book of History."" Retrospective calculation shows that it may have occurred as early as the autumn of 2158 B.C.. Simple methods for predicting solar eclipses seem to have been in use in China before 2000 b.c, but this eclipse of 2158 B.C.. is said to have appeared unexpectedly and to have so disturbed the emperor that he at once executed the two court astronomers for failing to predict it! In the Chinese canonical books thirty-eight solar eclipses are mentioned, eighteen of which agree with modern lists, but the others seem in error in either month or year, though the day is always correct."	This discrepancy in the records illustrates the challenges faced by early astronomers in accurately predicting and documenting astronomical events. The Chinese method of predicting eclipses was primarily based on the Saros cycle, a period of approximately 18 years and 11 days after which nearly identical eclipses occur. However, due to the complexity of celestial mechanics and limitations in observational technology, their predictions were not always accurate. The importance of eclipses in ancient China extended beyond mere scientific curiosity. Eclipses were considered significant omens that could foretell the fortune or misfortune of the emperor and the state. This led to a meticulous recording of these events, although the precision of these records varied. The role of court astronomers was crucial, and their ability to predict eclipses was a matter of life and death, as the fate of the unfortunate astronomers during the reign of Zhong Kang illustrates. Further complicating their efforts was the lack of understanding of the orbital dynamics of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. It wasn't until much later that the geometrical and physical nature of eclipses was fully understood. The ancient Chinese astronomers	1911	1987.3099
It was against this second outlying part that the Roman General Ostorius moved. The hill land of Wales was occupied in the north by the Ordovices, in the south by the Silures. The division between the two lies roughly where today lies the division between North and South Wales, namely, in that tongue of the lowland which advances into the heart of the country and reaches the base of Plinlimmon. It was against the first group, or Northern Welsh, that Ostorius advanced, and this because in so doing he could cut the forces that harassed him into two. He marched upon the mouth of the Dee, thus putting himself between the Pennines and the Welsh hills.	By controlling this strategic point, he effectively severed the communication lines between the northern tribes and those of the south, limiting their ability to aid each other, which was crucial for maintaining Roman dominance in the region. The Ordovices, known for their fierce resistance, were thus isolated from their southern counterparts, the Silures, who were equally renowned for their tenacity and guerrilla tactics against the Roman invaders. Ostorius's campaign was marked by a series of fortified posts along the border regions, which later became the basis for the Roman frontier system in Britain. These forts not only served military purposes but also facilitated the Romanization of the local populace, introducing Roman culture, language, and economic practices. As he pushed further into the territory of the Ordovices, skirmishes and battles became frequent, with the Roman legions facing harsh terrain and determined warriors. The Roman general's strategy also involved winning over some of the local tribes with diplomacy, offering them protection and trade opportunities in exchange for their allegiance. This mixed approach of military force and diplomatic engagement was typical of Roman expansion tactics, which often sought	1912	1955.0609
By symmetry all straight lines originally vertical and at the same radius must evidently suffer the same change of inclination, and must all cut the vertical axis in the same point, a circular cylindrical surface with axis COV (Fig. 192) being transformed into a conical surface with the same axis. . '(V k£r j Let x be the distance before straining of any point P (Fig. 192) in the plate from the central axis perpendicular to the plate; let y be its distance from the middle plane of the plate, reckoned positive downwards, and let 6 be the inclination to the vertical of lines originally vertical at a radius x.	Assuming a uniform distribution of strain, the angle θ can be expressed as a function of the radius x and the applied force or moment causing the deformation. For a given moment M, the stress distribution through the thickness of the plate can be analyzed to find the resultant change in angle, θ, at each radius. The bending moment M causes a curvature in the plate, described by the radius of curvature R, which is inversely proportional to M and the bending stiffness EI of the plate (where E is the modulus of elasticity and I is the moment of inertia of the plate's cross-section). This relationship is given by: \[ \frac{1}{R} = \frac{M}{EI} \] From the geometry of the deformed plate, the angle θ can be related to the radius of curvature R. At a distance x from the central axis, the vertical displacement w of any point on the plate can be approximated (for small deformations) by: \[ w = \frac{x^2}{2R} \] The angle θ, being the	1908	1962.049
And I am unable to believe that we can even approximate the true history of any group of animals so long as those stages are ignored. Equally important is the paleontological evidence and to ignore it when it exists in any appreciable amount is indefensible and may result in deplorable error. For some reason the relationship of systematic zoology to geographical distribution has been more generally recognised than its relation to palaeontology, but it seems to me obvious that in the diversification of the animal kingdom, the element of time has been fully as important as that of space. In neither case, however, is it justifiable to assume that quantity (of either time or space) is necessarily correlated with specific qualities. Discontinuous distribution, either geologically or geographically, ought never to be regarded by itself as a differential character.	The true significance of such discontinuities can only be understood in the context of broader patterns and processes, such as vicariance, dispersal, or extinction events. These phenomena require a synthesis of evidence from both current and historical biogeography, as well as from the fossil record, to be properly interpreted. This integrative approach helps to avoid the pitfalls of superficial analysis based solely on present-day observations, which may overlook the dynamic and often complex history of life on Earth. Moreover, as we delve deeper into the study of evolutionary biology, it becomes increasingly clear that the interplay between genetics, ecology, and paleontology is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity. The genetic underpinnings of speciation and adaptation, when viewed alongside paleontological data, offer a more complete picture of how organisms have evolved and diversified over time. This holistic perspective is essential not only for reconstructing the past but also for predicting future patterns of evolution and distribution in response to environmental changes. Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to refine our methods of integrating data from different scientific disciplines. Only through such interdisciplinary	1911	2006.7931
Public institutions, in other words, will not be regarded as detached pieces of mechanism, but as exhibiting one of the many ways in which the social consciousness finds expression .The perspective will be somewhat different from that employed in the ordinary historical textbooks, since the epochs will be marked not by the deaths of kings nor by any such redistribution of weights as may be the result of the shifting play of political parties, but by the entrance of new social forces, and by the successive modification of the organs of government rendered necessary by industrial and social progress. Thus the real English Revolution occurs not in 1215, nor in 1640, nor in 1689, but in 1832, 1867, and 1884, when a constitution adapted to  an agricultural state was by successive stages expanded under the stress of an industrial revolution, to admit merchants and tradespeople, artisans and ploughmen, to control the destinies of the nation. One of the most important aspects of the study of comparative law and institutions is what may be called the natural history of Transplantation.	This involves examining how legal and institutional frameworks are adopted, adapted, or rejected by societies other than those in which they originated. It is a process that reveals much about the adaptability and resilience of social structures, as well as the cultural nuances that can either facilitate or hinder the integration of foreign elements. Through this lens, one can observe how British common law was modified to suit the local conditions of its colonies, or how the Napoleonic Code influenced the judicial systems of various European and Latin American countries. The study of transplantation extends beyond mere legal frameworks to include political, educational, and social institutions. For instance, the spread of the British parliamentary system can be analyzed to understand how different cultures have adjusted the concept to fit their own political and social contexts, leading to a range of hybrid systems. Similarly, the global spread of Western education models provides insights into the dynamics of cultural assimilation and resistance. In this broader view, each act of transplantation can be seen as a microcosm of cultural exchange and adaptation, providing a rich field of study for sociologists, historians, and legal scholars.

"During her travels, various things happened. One chilly afternoon, in early March, when a light powdering of snow lay on the northern slopes of the hills, Coryston went up to the cottage in the hopes of finding Marion Atherstone alone. There had been a quiet understanding between them all the winter, more or less known to the Coryston family, but all talk of marriage had been silenced by the condition of Lady Coryston, who indeed never knew such schemes were in the air. About six weeks, however, after his mother's death, Coryston's natural fougue suggested to him that he was being trifled with. He burst into the little sitting room where Marion was just making tea, and sat down, scowling, on the farther side of the hearth. ""What is the matter?"" Marion asked, mildly. During the winter a beautifying change seemed to have passed upon Atherstone's daughter. She was younger, better looking, better dressed; yet keeping always the touch of homeliness, of smiting common-sense, which had first attracted a man in secret rebellion against his own rhetoric and other people's."	"Coryston, with a sudden impulse, leaned forward, his hands gripping the arms of the chair as he looked into the fire. ""Matter? The matter is simple—too simple, perhaps. I've been patient, Marion, haven't I? But I feel as though I've been waiting, hovering on the edge of something, without knowing whether I'm to fall or fly."" Marion paused, her hands still busy with the teapot, her expression one of gentle concern. ""You've been very patient, Coryston. And I—I've been thinking too."" Her voice was soft, reflective, as if she were choosing her words with care. ""Thinking? About us?"" His tone was urgent, almost desperate. ""Yes, about us,"" she affirmed, setting down the teapot and facing him squarely. ""I know this hasn't been easy for you—or for me. But you know the circumstances were not ordinary."" ""I know, I know,"" he rushed out. ""But Marion, life is moving, and we—are we moving with it, or are we stuck"	1913	1966.8782
The investigations in progress relate to three different aspects of the general problem: First, how do different feeding stuffs compare with each other as to their content of energy and the proportion of it which is available to the animal? Second, what is the relative efficiency of different types of animals as converters of waste energy into human food? Third, how do the various conditions under which animals may be kept affect their efficiency in this respect? To the extent to which it becomes possible to answer these questions for the different species of farm animals we shall possess the scientific basis for a rational system of conserving to the utmost for man's use the energy which the studies of the chemist, the physicist, the botanist, the agronomist and the soil expert have taught the farmer how to accumulate in his crops.	By understanding the specific energy contributions of various feeds, farmers can optimize their usage, tailoring their feeding strategies to maximize the nutritional intake of their livestock and, consequently, the output of animal-based products. Furthermore, by exploring the conversion efficiency of different animal species, agricultural scientists and farmers can make more informed decisions about which species are most economically and environmentally viable for specific farming operations. This not only aids in enhancing food production but also in reducing wastage and improving sustainability within agricultural systems. Moreover, the influence of environmental and management conditions on animal productivity is another crucial aspect. Factors such as housing, temperature, and handling can significantly affect the stress levels and overall health of animals, which in turn impacts their ability to process and convert feed into body mass or products like milk, eggs, and meat. Studies that clarify these relationships will allow for the development of better animal husbandry practices that optimize comfort and productivity, ensuring that each animal can produce at its best potential while maintaining welfare standards. In sum, the integration of these investigative findings into everyday farming practices promises not only to enhance the efficiency of food production but also	1911	2006.7328
Absence of fronts in the anti cyclone is one underlying reason for its steady velocity and its uniform path. When an anti cyclone follows a cyclone, as one invariably does in the temperate zone, the anti cyclone velocity and direction of travel should be the basis upon which both the cyclone and anti cyclone centre displacements and velocities of travel is made. Extrapolation procedure is the same as that employed for the cyclone, ie., plotting the previous path and velocity and extrapolating both of them. Oblong anti cyclones should be extrapolated at right angles to the long axis; any other extrapolation brings in too great a possibility for error. Circular anti cyclones can be extrapolated along their previous paths. In using the extrapolation method where an anti cyclone and a cyclone are reasonably near each other, agreement as to the direction of movement and the velocity of both should be present before too much faith is placed in expected displacements of either wind system.	This is crucial because the interaction between the cyclone and anticyclone can significantly influence their respective paths and intensities. The pressure gradient between these systems often leads to an acceleration of wind speeds and can alter the trajectory of the cyclone especially. It is also important to consider the upper atmospheric conditions, as jet streams and other high-altitude winds can further complicate the dynamics between these systems.  Meteorologists must carefully analyze satellite imagery and radar data to monitor these interactions. The use of ensemble forecasting, where multiple models are run with slightly varying initial conditions, can also help in understanding the range of possible outcomes when cyclones and anticyclones interact. This approach provides a probabilistic assessment that can be invaluable for making more informed predictions about weather patterns and preparing for potential severe weather events. In summary, while the steady nature of anticyclones generally makes their paths more predictable, their interactions with nearby cyclonic systems must be closely monitored to ensure accurate weather forecasting. This requires a comprehensive understanding of both the individual characteristics of these systems and the larger atmospheric context in which they occur.	1913	2006.7598
Then followed a vivid resume of Italy's history from the earliest days, when the Roman Empire expressed the idea of conquest, which was the dominant passion of that age, down to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when Italy more than any other nation voiced the spiritual, intellectual and aesthetic awakening which later was to become worldwide.	This awakening, known as the Renaissance, marked a profound shift in human thought, culture, and artistic expression. Italy, with its city-states like Florence, Venice, and Rome, became the crucible for this transformative period. Artists such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael not only revolutionized the visual arts with techniques like perspective and chiaroscuro but also imbued their works with humanistic values that centered human experience and rationality. Intellectually, thinkers like Machiavelli and Galileo challenged existing doctrines, reshaping political theory and scientific understanding. The impact of these changes was so profound that it rippled outwards beyond Italy, influencing literature, philosophy, science, and governance across Europe. As the centuries progressed, Italy faced numerous challenges, including foreign domination by powers such as Spain, France, and Austria, leading to periods of decline and strife. Yet, the spirit of the Renaissance endured, manifesting anew during the Risorgimento in the 19th century, a fervent period of nationalism and struggle that eventually culminated in the unification of Italy in 	1911	2006.5475
Tail rudimentary. Pouch present. THE TASMANIAN WOMBAT 111 Genus Phascolomys. Characters those of the Family. The Common Australian Wombat. Phascolomys mitchelli. Bhiuarium (tip of the nose) large, naked, and black. Fur coarse and harsh. General colour variable black, grizzled yellow and black, or yellowish. Ears short and rounded. Ribs fifteen. Head and body about forty-four inches. New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Wombats.	are solitary, nocturnal creatures, primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, and bark. Their powerful limbs and sharp claws make them adept at burrowing. The burrows they construct are extensive, with multiple chambers and entrances, providing shelter and protection. Wombats are known for their slow metabolism, which helps them survive in arid conditions by conserving energy and water. The unique characteristic of wombats is their backward-facing pouch. Unlike other marsupials where the pouch opens forward, the wombat’s pouch faces backwards, which prevents dirt and debris from entering the pouch while the mother digs. This adaptation is crucial for the survival of the offspring, particularly during the early stages of development when they are completely dependent on the pouch for protection and nourishment. Despite their cumbersome appearance, wombats can move quickly when threatened and are capable of inflicting serious injuries with their teeth and claws if provoked. They are generally shy and reclusive but will defend their territory vigorously if necessary. Conservation efforts are in place to protect their habitats from destruction due to agriculture and urban expansion, ensuring that	1909	2004.979

"J. C. HUDSON. "" PRODUCTION: A STUDY IN ECONOMICS."" By P. H. Castberg. Sonnenschein. From internal evidence we gather that the author of this work is a man of practical business training, probably connected with finance."	His approach to the subject of production is not purely theoretical but is enriched by his firsthand experience in the economic field. This practical perspective is evident throughout the book as Castberg discusses various aspects of production, from the allocation of resources to the efficiency of labor and the impact of technological advancements. Castberg's analysis frequently delves into the intricacies of financial markets and their role in production, suggesting strategies for optimizing output and reducing waste. His discussions on the interplay between capital and labor showcase a deep understanding of the forces that drive production in a modern economy. Moreover, the book does not shy away from the complexities introduced by global trade. Castberg examines how international markets influence domestic production decisions and the implications of these dynamics for economic policy. This global perspective is particularly valuable, offering readers insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by a interconnected world economy. Throughout the text, Castberg supports his arguments with data and case studies, which not only provide evidence for his claims but also make the material accessible to readers who may not have a background in economics. This blend of practical business insights with rigorous economic analysis makes	1908	2006.8461
Taking the word art in its widest sense, it is clear that there may be branches and sub branches of it corresponding to all our moods. Dealing specifically with painting alone, a moment's thought will enable us to recall infinite varieties; but it may be sufficient for our present purpose to mention two. The Italian painters of the Renaissance period were pagan in all but name. Their works are full of health, life, spirit, energy; or, to express this rather more correctly, their works are of such a nature that, without being themselves disfigured by the inartistic representation of movement, they induce the glow of health and a full life in the brain and body of the spectator. It is enough to mention the names of Leonardo, Titian, Michael Angelo, Correggio, Giorgione, Tintoretto, and Paolo Veronese, or even the less important, but still great, Andrea del Sarto, Sebastiano del Piombo, and Palma Vecchio.	On the other hand, the Northern Renaissance painters, particularly those from the Netherlands and Germany, cultivated a different vein. Their art, often deeply imbued with a religious and moral earnestness, tended to emphasize detail, texture, and the play of light and shadow, reflecting perhaps the more introspective and mercantile spirit of their societies. Artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein, and Jan van Eyck, through their meticulous attention to the nuances of the physical world and human expression, sought to convey not just the beauty of the surface but also a deeper moral or spiritual truth. Their works, rich in symbolism and complexity, invite the viewer to a contemplative engagement, where the act of viewing becomes an act of reading and interpretation, revealing layers of meaning that speak to the condition of the human soul and its struggles.  Thus, while the Italian masters celebrated the beauty and vigor of the human form and the richness of the earthly life, their Northern counterparts explored the spiritual and ethical dimensions of human existence, often set against a backdrop of domestic life or the natural world	1911	1982.5057
"Thus the cooling necessary to cause a stress of 1 tonne per square inch would be — 0 08O6 or about 12° F The different amounts of expansion in different metals in a machine may cause serious stresses to be set up due to temperature changes. Occasionally use is made of the different expansions of two parts. 6o Example i. — If a bar of steel i inch diameter and 10 feet long is heated to 10o° F. above the temperature of the atmosphere, and then firmly gripped at its ends, find the tension in the bar when cooled to the temperature of the atmosphere if during cooling it pulls the end fastenings ^"" nearer together."	First, we calculate the coefficient of linear expansion for steel, which is typically around 0.00000645 per degree Fahrenheit. Given that the steel bar is heated to 100°F above ambient temperature, we need to determine the total expansion over this temperature range. The formula for linear expansion is: \[ \Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T \] where \( \Delta L \) is the change in length, \( \alpha \) is the coefficient of linear expansion, \( L \) is the original length, and \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature. Plugging in the values, we get: \[ \Delta L = 0.00000645 \times 120 \text{ inches} \times 100 \] \[ \Delta L = 0.774 \text{ inches} \] However, the bar is cooled such that it only contracts by \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch instead of the full 0.774 inches it expanded. This means the contraction is restricted by \( 0.774 - 	1908	1991.4073
We mentioned the strong suggestibility of the child which makes him yield easily to outside influences. The resistance to the haphazard temptations of the surroundings must be reenforced, the overcoming of fatigue must be developed; in short, persistence must be learned. It is not in contradiction with this statement that the small child may sometimes show attacks of stubbornness, just as the attention of the child may sometimes, for instance, at play, show an unusual continuity, almost a fascination. There we have to do with phenomena which belong to the sphere of suggestion. Such stubbornness or such fascination of attention are passing autosuggestions. The fundamental trait in the child remains the easy shifting of attention and will alike.	This inherent fluctuation can be seen as both a challenge and an opportunity in the educational process. The educator's task, then, is to guide this natural tendency towards a constructive and regulated form of change, one that allows the child to adapt and learn effectively within a structured environment. By carefully balancing freedom and guidance, educators can harness the child’s suggestibility to foster a sense of curiosity and a desire for knowledge, while simultaneously teaching the skills necessary to focus and persevere. As the child grows, the development of self-regulation becomes crucial. This involves cultivating the ability to control impulses, delay gratification, and maintain effort despite distractions or difficulties. Such skills are essential for the kind of sustained attention required in formal schooling and, later, in various aspects of adult life. To achieve this, educational strategies should include a variety of activities that promote active engagement and require different levels of self-control and concentration. For instance, group projects can teach cooperation and the need to stay on task, while individual assignments can help hone personal responsibility and independent work skills. Moreover, incorporating elements of play and exploration within the	1909	2007.3556
The extravagance of these claims is generally derived from the fact that the tensile strength of the alloys is stated in terms of the hard drawn or otherwise severely cold worked material, in addition, statements regarding the density of the alloys are frequently erroneous, particularly when very strong hard alloys are said to be of lower specific weight than pure aluminium. Such a lower specific weight can only be obtained by alloying aluminium with a metal lighter than itself, and of these magnesium is the only one entering into practical consideration at the present time. The known constitution of the aluminium magnesium alloys, however, makes it certain that additions of magnesium of more than a very few percent, must render the alloys brittle and weak. Thus it has been found by recent experiments that the addition of one half percent, of magnesium to an alloy consisting of 80 percent, aluminium and 20 percent, zinc makes it exceedingly difficult, if not quite impossible, to roll the material when hot.	Moreover, the corrosion resistance of such alloys tends to decrease significantly with increasing magnesium content, which complicates their use in applications exposed to harsh environmental conditions. The practical upper limit for magnesium in these alloys is generally considered to be around 5 percent. Beyond this, not only does brittleness become a severe issue, but also the overall mechanical properties start to degrade, negating the initial benefits sought from the magnesium addition. It is crucial, therefore, for engineers and designers to balance the desired traits of lightness and strength with the realistic capabilities and limitations of the material. Misunderstandings about the properties of aluminium-magnesium alloys can lead to inappropriate applications, resulting in material failure and potentially hazardous situations.  In the realm of alloy development, ongoing research and testing are essential to accurately define the characteristics of new compositions. This ensures that the data provided to the industry is both accurate and applicable, preventing overestimations of material capabilities that can lead to critical failures in practical applications.	1912	2002.9506

The Slender Tree Frog, despite its aquatic affinities, is equally at home amidst the foliage, where its vibrant colors blend seamlessly with the verdant surroundings. Its diet consists primarily of insects, which it captures with a swift, darting motion of its tongue. During mating season, the calls of the males resonate through the night air, a chorus of croaks that serves both to attract females and to establish territorial boundaries among competing males. Breeding occurs shortly after the onset of the rainy season, when temporary pools form—ideal nurseries for their offspring. Females lay clutches of eggs on the water's surface, where they adhere to vegetation. These eggs, enveloped in a gelatinous coating, hatch into tadpoles that are particularly agile swimmers, owing to their fully webbed toes. As tadpoles metamorphose into juvenile frogs, their aquatic adaptations gradually give way to features better suited for arboreal life. The transformation culminates in the development of larger adhesive discs on their fingers and toes, enabling them to ascend vertical surfaces with remarkable ease. The Sl	1909	1989.5895
"Whatever his rank, he was a most magnificent figure, his whole bearing being serenely dignified, majestic and impressive ; whilst the expression upon his radiantly glowing countenance was benign and intelligent beyond anything I had imagined or anticipated, though I had expected much. What followed, however, was surprising beyond measure, and it was startling and electrifying in the suddenness with which it came upon me ; for, as this splendid being moved towards me with stately steps, and both hands outstretched in greeting, he said to rne in English, "" Welcome to Mars! welcome to my country, oh stranger from a far off world ! In the name of the whole people, I bid you welcome to our world, which we call ' Tetarta, ' and to this city of Sirapion !"""	"His voice was rich and melodious, resonating with a warmth that seemed to echo the very spirit of the planet itself. I was momentarily dumbfounded, not only by the unexpected fluency in my language but also by the sheer grandeur of his presence. As I regained my composure, I took his hands, which were surprisingly human in their touch—warm and firm. ""Thank you, sir,"" I managed to reply, my voice barely above a whisper. ""It is an honor to be here, and your welcome is most gracious."" A smile played upon his lips as he gently released my hands and gestured towards the magnificent panorama that lay beyond the towering columns of the entrance hall. ""Come,"" he said, ""let me show you the wonders of Sirapion, a city that thrives not only in the arts of peace and learning but also in the harmony with which we live with our world.""

"It is much more reasonable to believe that economic and cultural interests will ultimately supplant purely ethnic interests as the groundwork of world contacts. The real kernel of the colour problem, then, is likely to continue to be what it is at present, the question of social contact among peoples of different racial stocks, and particularly of different cultural levels, living together within given political areas, rather than a struggle of independent racial masses against each other. In America there is a wide spread belief that our colour problem is one peculiar to 1 See the report of the South African Native Baces Committee entitled ""The South African Natives, "" Ch. VII. ourselves."	This belief, however, overlooks the broader implications and the global nature of racial and cultural interactions. In truth, race relations are a universal issue, manifesting differently across various contexts and regions. The United States, with its unique historical and social dynamics, certainly presents a distinct case study, but it is by no means isolated in grappling with these challenges. Internationally, similar patterns of tension and negotiation can be observed, whether in the colonial legacies of Africa and Asia, the indigenous rights movements in Australia and Latin America, or the integration challenges faced in the diverse societies of Europe. Each of these scenarios underscores the complexity of race as a social construct, influenced heavily by historical, economic, and political factors. Furthermore, as global migration increases and the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the intersections of race, culture, and economics become more pronounced. The movement of peoples brings disparate cultures into closer proximity, often highlighting disparities in economic opportunity and cultural recognition. This, in turn, can lead to new forms of social stratification and conflict, but also to new opportunities for cultural exchange and mutual enrichment. Thus,	1911	2006.9694
"His classification of women as (i) courtesans and (2) mothers has, no doubt, something to support it, and may be otherwise stated as (i) women who are ultra individualistic and (2) . women in whom Nature's purpose assumes preponderant generic aspects. In its emphasis of the immorality of most marital relations, "" Mere Man"" destroys the conception that the state is produced by a divine power having in mind the welfare of its units. It is, at best, a man made scheme, whose chief object is to secure to man for all time at least one victim upon whom he can sat his passion."	"This perspective, while radical, undeniably opens a discourse on the power dynamics inherent in traditional marital structures and the societal constructs surrounding them. The author of ""Mere Man"" seems to argue that the institution of marriage, rather than being a sanctified or inherently noble arrangement, is instead a tool designed by patriarchal systems to perpetuate male dominance and control. This critique challenges the romanticized view of marriage as a mutual partnership, suggesting instead that it often serves to enforce gender roles and suppress female autonomy. The portrayal of women solely as courtesans or mothers further underscores a reductionist view where women's identities are confined to their relationships with men, either through sexual or reproductive capacities. This dichotomy simplifies the complex nature of women's roles and experiences, reducing their value to functions beneficial to men, either for pleasure or procreation.  Such a stark division not only strips women of their individuality and diversity but also ignores their capabilities beyond these roles. It is a critique that calls for a reevaluation of societal norms and the structures that enforce these limited roles, pushing for a recognition of"	1911	2007.654

As the situation grew increasingly dire, the commanding officer quickly realized that a change of tactics was essential if they were to hold their position against the overwhelming German forces.

Meanwhile, reconnaissance units were dispatched to flank Hazeleigh Wood, aiming to disrupt the enemy's rifle fire advantage. The artillery units, having located the source of the shrapnel storm north of Purleigh, began a counter-barrage, their guns thundering in response as they sought to neutralize the German batteries. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and the sounds of chaos, but the British forces were determined not to yield. As the infantry dug in, the cavalry units were repositioned to the rear, ready to exploit any weaknesses in the German lines that might be revealed by the ongoing artillery exchange.

Tail short, uniformly thickly hairy. Head and body twenty-eight inches, tail twelve inches. Confined to Tasmania. When Tasmania was first settled, the Devil was common, and preyed extensively on the poultry and the sheep, but now it has been driven back to the very roughest country. It is a powerful but sluggish beast, but so fierce and provided with such strong canine teeth that it is more than a match for any ordinary dog. The whole dentition is pronouncedly carnivorous, and the animal bites severely, while the molar teeth enable it to crush the largest bones with ease. Being slow in movement, like the Bear, it captures its prey by a sudden spring, and will then eat it greedily, bones and all. It will come down to the seashore, and devour dead fish or any other edible jetsam. Its voice is a disagreeable hollow bark, varied by an occasional still more disagreeable snort.

"Now no one dare accuse Dr. Murray of being in any way untrue to philology. His is primarily a literary interest; he is, in fact, giving us a first instalment of a history of Greek literature. But he is anxious to consider Greek literature from a new standpoint, which he explains, and, I think, successfully justifies, in his first lecture. He wishes to concern himself with it as it bears on "" the service of man."" For him to be classical is not to be dead, but to be alive."	"Dr. Murray seeks to demonstrate how the ancient texts can offer insights into human nature, ethics, and the dynamics of society that remain relevant today. His lectures explore the enduring human themes found in Greek tragedies, comedies, and philosophical works, arguing that these works embody universal truths about the human condition. He emphasizes the practical application of these ancient insights in contemporary life, suggesting that they can provide guidance in navigating modern social and personal challenges. By focusing on ""the service of man,"" Dr. Murray elevates the study of Greek literature from a purely academic pursuit to a valuable tool for understanding and improving the human experience. He argues that the wisdom of the Greeks can aid in the cultivation of virtue, the pursuit of justice, and the quest for a meaningful life. Through his scholarly work, he strives to bridge the gap between the ancient and modern worlds, making the case that the classics offer not only cultural value but also practical wisdom. In this way, Dr. Murray's approach is both a revival and a reimagining of classical studies, proposing that the true value of studying the ancients is found"	1908	2006.2043
"— ED.] 9 9 9 ECONOMIC LIFEBOATS. To the Editor of THE FREEWOMAN. MADAM, — I am one whom you have convinced in regard to the right of steamship officials to live when someone must drown. I at first thought that in the confusion of a wreck, the matter of one human being or another going down is not an ethical matter; but when responsibility for safe conditions is considered, and the neglect is criminal, there is but one verdict; and a brave captain accepted that verdict in advance, and refused to be saved, preferring oblivion to the conscience from which he never could escape. A writer in the Standard instructs that the loss of a millionaire is "" incalculably greater"" than the loss of a lady's maid. One may do nothing but collect unearned income, and the other perform services for an equally idle ""lady, "" such as busier women perform for themselves."	Yet, it is clear that the value of a life cannot be measured by the wealth it controls or the service it renders in economic terms alone. The inherent worth of each individual, regardless of status or occupation, demands recognition. This principle must guide our actions and policies, particularly in moments of crisis such as a shipwreck. It is a gross moral failure to weigh lives on a scale of social or financial importance. Further, the argument put forth by the writer in the Standard perpetuates a dangerous precedent, one that prioritizes material wealth over human dignity. This outlook not only devalues the lives of those deemed 'less important' but also undermines the very fabric of our ethical society. If we follow this logic, we risk creating a world where the right to survival is reserved only for the affluent and influential. Therefore, it is imperative that we advocate for and implement safety measures that protect all individuals equally, without prejudice or bias. This includes ensuring that lifeboats and other safety protocols are adequate and accessible for everyone, regardless of their economic contribution or social standing. The true measure of a civilized society	1911	1998.0609
But many other towns have no such claim, and yet prove of capital importance in the military history of England, and that be cause, having arisen for reasons other than military, they found, once they had risen, excellent bases of supply and centres of population which could feed and equip an army on the march. Of this kind are Derby, Warwick, Northamp   tonne, Hereford, etc. ; and, of cities founded before the Roman military scheme, or at any rate not demonstrably necessary to its strategic plan, Gloucester, Worcester, Salisbury, Leicester, Winchester and York. These great places, and fifty others, once established, become necessarily depots for supply. They are fortified. Once fortified they become obstacles as well as depots; refuges as well as obstacles, and the whole scheme of warfare is bound to turn upon their position. We shall find them per petually recurrent in the story of our wars.	Their strategic importance often drew the line of march for advancing armies and dictated the sites of encampments. The proximity of such towns to rivers and other natural resources made them even more valuable. For instance, Gloucester, situated by the River Severn, served as a key point in controlling the movements between the north and south of England, while York, by the River Ouse, was crucial in the control of the north. As these towns grew in military importance, their fortifications were enhanced. Walls, castles, and other defensive structures were erected or strengthened, making them formidable obstacles to any invading force. This, in turn, influenced the tactics and strategies employed during sieges and assaults. Commanders had to consider the robust defenses of these towns and often laid prolonged sieges or devised intricate strategies to capture them. Moreover, these towns did not only serve military functions. They were also vibrant centers of commerce and culture, which contributed to their ability to supply and sustain large armies. Markets thrived, local militias were formed, and the towns' populations could be levied for defense purposes. 	1912	1906.9598
"Irrigation is to accomplish the miracle. But whence the water? To be sure the time is some ten years gone by since the folk of the gold fields economically waited for the next rain (as they relate) to bathe. But the municipal water rate in the mining centre of Kalgoorlie is still annually one shilling and sixpence in the pound sterling on the value of the property — which hints at some slight scarcity; and a government engineer said: ""This country will be irrigated  850 only when we have learned how to bring the rain storms in from the coast."	""" Yet, with the problem pressing, innovation and technology seek to bridge the gap between arid stretches and water abundance. The idea of constructing pipelines from the coast has been proposed, to channel seawater directly into the heart of these thirsty lands. Once conveyed, this sea influx could undergo desalination, transforming it into a fresh, usable resource. Desalination, though costly, offers a semblance of hope. Techniques like reverse osmosis have been honed to a point where they can reliably turn saltwater into fresh, albeit with significant energy requirements and associated costs. These modern alchemies, however, are not beyond the reach of a community built on the backbreaking search for gold. The same determination that drove miners deep into the earth could surely muster the resolve to wrest water from the ocean. Moreover, there is talk of harnessing the power of the sun.

She moved closer, her presence a comforting warmth. ""The city can do that to you,"" she agreed. ""It's like a relentless wave that doesn’t let up. But you’ve got to remember, it ebbs as much as it flows."" John smiled weakly, appreciative of her metaphor. ""I reckon you’re right,"" he conceded. ""It’s just hard to see the shoreline when you’re in the thick of it"	1913	1997.7745
The property of Dives did not fall in value when he died, and yet he became a pauper in the twinkling of an eye. There is no question but that those who live to win wealth in this world have a more real and substantial end in view than the mere pleasure seekers. But the thing that we ought to understand and remember is precisely what that end is. It is the acquisition in our hands of a certain thing whose possession is very brief, and whose value depends entirely upon the use to which it is put. Now, if we make the mere gaining of that thing the desired haven of our life, we certainly spend our strength for nought, and our labour for that which satisfieth not.	For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Wealth, as a means to well-being, is a worthy pursuit, but wealth as an end unto itself is a hollow chase. The true value of riches lies not in the hoarding of coins and notes, but in their potential to improve lives, to foster relationships, to educate, to heal, and to empower. Wealth can open doors and create opportunities, but it can also close hearts and corrupt spirits if allowed to become the master rather than the servant. Therefore, it behooves us to approach our quest for prosperity with wisdom and a clear understanding of its transient nature. We must strive to balance the material with the spiritual, the temporal with the eternal, ensuring that while we build our earthly treasures, we neglect not the treasures of the heart and soul. Thus, the wise use of wealth, directed by a moral compass and a generous spirit, can indeed enrich not just the individual, but the world at large.	1908	1905.1254
Whenever a newly built pile of yellow green earth was encountered, the bearers tore open the galleries with their rods; and as the huge black soldiers and the white, immature insects appeared, the people picked them up daintily and ate them with apparent relish. So also the bucks would eat the great grasshoppers and the young taken from the wasp nests whose adult inhabitants they stupefied by smoke. As the day wore on, the tiny black flies of this region attacked the column in swarms, and each bite was marked by a spot of blood. The heat became more oppressive, and no longer did one dash off from the path in pursuit of a brilliant butterfly or buzzing beetle.	Instead, the marchers focused their energies on maintaining a steady pace, swatting away the persistent flies, and conserving their strength under the relentless sun. The landscape around them, once a vibrant tapestry of colors and sounds, now seemed muted and hostile in the oppressive heat. The occasional rustle in the underbrush no longer prompted a curious glance; wary eyes were kept on the path ahead. As the sun began its slow descent toward the horizon, the air grew slightly cooler, and the group's spirits lifted somewhat. The leaders of the expedition called for a brief halt by a small, clear stream. Here, they could replenish their water supplies and rest their weary legs. The cool water was a balm to their parched throats and swollen feet. Some of the group took to splashing water on their faces and necks, washing away the grime and sweat of the day's journey. The brief respite by the stream also allowed them to gather some of the area's edible plants. Women skilled in foraging plucked tender shoots and leaves, adding them to the	1913	1980.8143
The test might be performed with a single observation by hanging the greatest possible load on the beam at some point on the opposite side of the fulcrum to the shackles, without causing the beam to move downwards, and then finding what load may be hung on the shackle without moving the beam upwards. The error due to want of sensitiveness may be actually greater at heavy loads than at zero load at which the test is made, but proportionally to the pressure on the knife edge it will probably be less. Want of sensitiveness arises from wear, causing bluntness of the knife edges or grooves in the seatings on which the knife edges rest. (3) Weight of the Movable Counterpoise.	The accuracy of the balance can be significantly influenced by the weight of the movable counterpoise. It is essential that the counterpoise be calibrated precisely to ensure that it does not introduce additional errors during the weighing process. If the counterpoise is too heavy or too light, it can affect the equilibrium of the balance, leading to inaccurate measurements. To prevent this, periodic checks and adjustments of the counterpoise should be conducted as part of routine maintenance. Furthermore, the smooth operation of the mechanism that moves the counterpoise is crucial. Any friction or obstruction in the movement can cause the balance to respond sluggishly, thereby affecting the sensitivity and accuracy of the scale. Lubrication of the moving parts and ensuring that they are free from dust and debris can help maintain the optimal performance of the balance. (4) Calibration and Regular Testing. Regular calibration is vital for maintaining the precision of the balance. This involves checking the accuracy of the balance using standard weights and making necessary adjustments. Calibration should be performed under various loads to ensure that the balance remains accurate across its entire operating range. Additionally,	1908	1976.7802
In these further experiments the pressure distribution over a section adjacent to the median section was determined. The surface pressure was communicated to the manometer through openings 3-6 mm. in diameter: the static pressure being determined by means of a static pressure tube [of the usual N.P.L. type] placed 2-30 m. in front of the surface under test, and 3-35 m. above the carriage. The pressure differences were measured by U tube manometers, a photograph of these l)eing taken when a constant speed was reached. The error due to up current found by pressure measurements confirmed that determined by measurements of total force. The surfaces tested ranged up to 7 m. in span.	The results obtained from these experiments were quite revealing. The pressure distribution was found to vary significantly along the span of the surface, with higher pressures typically observed towards the center and diminishing towards the edges. This variation is critical for understanding the aerodynamic behavior of the surface under different flight conditions. Furthermore, the use of U tube manometers proved to be effective for capturing precise pressure differences across the surface. The photographic records of the manometer readings at constant speeds provided a reliable method for later analysis, ensuring accuracy in the data collected. The experiments also included adjustments for environmental factors such as wind speed and direction, which could influence the pressure readings. By maintaining controlled conditions as much as possible, the influence of external variables was minimized, providing a clearer picture of the inherent aerodynamic properties of the tested surfaces. This detailed pressure mapping is essential for the design and optimization of aerodynamic structures, particularly in applications where efficient lift and minimal drag are crucial. The data not only helps in refining the shape and contour of the surfaces but also in predicting their performance in real-world operating conditions. Further studies are planned to expand on	1912	1992.5474
"We are still, however, without any work corresponding to MiillenhoS's Deutsche Alterlhumskunde. Mr. Chadwick is already known as a well equipped and scholarly historian by his "" Studies on Anglo-Saxon Institutions, "" and he has more recently contributed a chapter on our early epics to the Cambridge History of English Literature. In the former work he showed great skill in reconstructing the social and administrative system of the age from the Wergeld and other clues. In the present volume he carries his investigations further back, and by the light of philology, ethnology, and archaeology he provides the fullest account we possess of our Teutonic forefathers before they conquered Britain."	His method is thorough and his style clear, avoiding both the dry-as-dust pedantry and the over-enthusiastic speculation that often mar such studies. He begins with an examination of the earliest Teutonic society, drawing on linguistic evidence to suggest the social structures and religious beliefs of these ancient peoples. He traces their migrations and interactions with other tribes and civilizations, using archaeological findings to paint a vivid picture of their material culture. Chadwick's discussion of the legal and political institutions of the early Teutons is particularly enlightening. He explains the significance of the Wergeld and its role in their compensatory system of justice, showing how these legal practices reflected and reinforced the social values of honor and familial responsibility. His analysis extends to the military strategies and tactics of the Teutons, demonstrating how their warfare was deeply intertwined with their societal structure and religious beliefs. The volume also delves into the mythology and religious practices of the Teutonic tribes, providing a detailed account of their gods, rituals, and the role of seers and priests. Chadwick uses both textual sources	1908	1982.8905
Lowering of temperature is more rapid than dewpoint and eventually the parcel becomes saturated. This is shown at the right where the spread is zero. Within the parcel visibility is unrestricted as long as some spread remains. At the approach of saturation haze appears, which becomes pronounced when the parcel is fully saturated. The hazy translucent parcel becomes opaque with fog particles if a little cooling occurs after saturation is reached. FOG BOUNDARIES. — Most of the parcels in a broad and extensive wind possess relatively equal temperatures and dewpoints; if these parcels are carried from a warm region over cold surfaces, they will reach saturation at approximately the same position.	This uniformity in saturation leads to the formation of extensive fog layers, which often cover vast areas where the underlying surface conditions are consistent. Such phenomena are particularly common in coastal regions, where the interaction between land and sea temperatures creates ideal conditions for fog development. As these saturated air parcels encounter colder land surfaces during their transit, the lower temperatures accelerate the condensation process, effectively reducing the visibility to near zero in some instances. Navigational challenges are significant in these fog-bound areas, as the dense fog can persist for hours or even days, depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions. Mariners and pilots must rely heavily on their instruments and local weather advisories to navigate safely. The boundaries of the fog are often sharply defined, depending on the underlying geographical features and temperature gradients. As one moves away from the fog's core, where conditions gradually shift back to less saturated air, visibility improves markedly, often quite suddenly, creating a clear demarcation between the fog-bound zone and clearer areas. This transition zone is critical for understanding the movement and dissipation patterns of fog.	1913	2003.4615
"The Lecture on Feb. 1st, he mentioned, would deal with colour. AT THK NORTHAMPTON INSTITUTE. At the Northampton Institute the series of ten lectures previously announced in this journal has also commenced. The first, on Tuesday, Jan. 16th, by Mr. S. D. Chalmers', dealt with ' The Nature of Light and Radiation.' The lecturer discussed the theory of light production, pointing out the variation in the quality and efficiency of the light from various illuminants, and explaining the distinction between light from '• black bodies "" and from substances showing selective radiation. This aspect of the subject was likewise commented upon by Mr. F. M. Denton in his first lecture on Jan. 30th, when the production of light by incandescence and luminescence respectively was described, and illustrated by examples from modern electric illuminants."	The upcoming lectures in the series promise to further explore the complexities of light and its applications. The next lecture, scheduled for February 13th, will feature Dr. Helen Cartwright, who will speak on 'Optical Phenomena in Nature.' She plans to delve into how natural light interactions create visual spectacles such as rainbows, mirages, and the auroras. Dr. Cartwright will also discuss the principles of refraction and reflection, and how these can be observed in everyday life. Following this, on February 27th, Professor Johnathan Pryce will present 'The Human Perception of Light and Color.' His lecture will explore the physiological and psychological aspects of how humans perceive light and its colors. He will cover topics such as the structure of the human eye, color theory, and the impact of light on mood and behavior. Each lecture in this series not only aims to educate but also to inspire attendees to appreciate the intricate role that light plays in science and our daily lives. The Northampton Institute encourages students, faculty, and the public to engage with the speakers and to bring	1912	2003.2699
— It should be born in mind that Commander Schwann had never had any experience of flying before. Nevertheless he claims to be the first man to fly off the water in Kngland. Mr. Sippe subsequently made some Rood flights with the machine fitted with the same floats and identical in every respect. 238 The following points should also le noted : — * (1) It is not known yet whether the success obtained with the Mark VII. floats shows that these floats are superior in design to the previous floats, or whether it was not due simply to the extra power obtained from the engine when trying these floats. (2) The propeller in a hydroplane is very liable to damage. The slightest spray striking it will score the leading edge of the blades and eventually break them.	(3) The balance of the hydroplane is crucial, especially during takeoff and landing. Improper weight distribution can lead to instability and potential accidents. It is essential to ensure that the craft is evenly loaded and that the center of gravity is maintained within specified limits. (4) The skill of the pilot plays a significant role in the successful operation of a hydroplane. As demonstrated by Commander Schwann's initial lack of flying experience, even with the best technology, the human factor cannot be underestimated. Continuous training and practice are necessary to master the handling of these machines. (5) Weather conditions have a profound impact on the performance of hydroplanes. Wind, rain, and even ambient temperature can affect lift, propulsion, and the overall handling of the aircraft. Pilots must be adept at interpreting weather reports and making real-time decisions based on changing conditions. (6) Maintenance of the hydroplane is another critical aspect. Regular checks and repairs are necessary to ensure all components, especially the floats and propeller, are in optimal condition. Neglecting maintenance can lead to mechanical failures that may have	1912	1992.598

"Foreigners — sailors and others — had a rough time of it, many of them being thrust back and threatened by the indignant townspeople. Each time a foreigner was discovered there was a cry of ' spy and many innocent men had fortunate escapes. "" The river seemed clear, when about seven o'clock there suddenly loomed up from seaward a great, ugly, grey hulled warship flying the German flag. The fear was realised. Her sight caused absolute panic, for with a sudden swerve she calmly moored opposite the Alexandra Dock. """	The air was tense as the townsfolk watched the warship, its decks bristling with the dark outlines of guns and crew members moving about with military precision. Whispers and murmurs spread like wildfire, each carrying different speculations and theories about the intentions of the German vessel. The local authorities were in a state of heightened alert, hastily convening to discuss the situation and possible responses.  Meanwhile, the sight of the foreign warship instilled a mix of fear and curiosity among the children, who gathered at a safe distance, their eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination. Their parents, however, were less enthralled, pulling them back and hurrying to secure their homes, drawing curtains and locking doors. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a gloomy shadow over the town, the warship turned on its powerful searchlights, sweeping them across the town like probing fingers. The beam of light felt invasive, as if it stripped the town of its privacy and safety, leaving its inhabitants exposed and vulnerable. The captain of the warship, visible on the bridge	1906	1986.7001
"Somewhat akin to this fashion, the Young Lady transferred to canvas the interior of the warm cafe. Madame in her high caisse was her loftiest mound, the green of the billiard table her middle distance, and the inhabitants of the houses which the Illustrator was acquiring by pencil her foreground. She did not entirely neglect us, nor, for convivial reasons, did we neglect her, and her concern for the Photographer showed itself in a continual laying down of her palette and a rushing up the steeps to see if he had ""turned it."" He gallantly accompanied her back to the cafe after this, admiring bits of architecture from Wm tm H»\£ Street of the Tables under the same umbrella, there to rest at the little table until we searched them out, and in this way I was more and more thrown with the Illustrator, for which he had not planned, but which he accepted as the fate that must overtake the married man who has to sit still for his living."	The Illustrator, with his sharp eye for detail and the nuances of shadow and light, often found himself caught up in the scenes that unfolded around him. His sketches, therefore, were not merely reproductions of reality but rather interpretations, filled with the subtle interplay of life and art. As the Young Lady returned to her easel, she carried with her not only the physical impressions of the bustling cafe but also the emotional resonance of those brief interactions by the umbrella-shielded table. Meanwhile, the Photographer, ever the silent observer, captured moments with a click that seemed to freeze time. His photographs were a counterpoint to the fluid stories the Illustrator's pencil spun—each a precise moment, an exact slice of time, devoid of the preceding or following seconds that might dilute its truth. As for myself, drawn into this artistic mélange, I found the dynamics fascinating. The way the Young Lady moved between canvas and life, how the Illustrator's sketches grew more animated with each observation, and the Photographer’s quiet satisfaction in capturing the unspoken stories of cafe dwellers—all these elements w	1913	2006.5742
It freezes solid or nearly so by the time the vertical wind releases it for a renewed attempt at reaching the earth. Again it is carried by a different vertical wind into the freezing region. Each time it descends, it grows by passing through moisture rich layers of air, and each time it is carried into the freezing region the newly added layer of water becomes a layer of ice. Eventually, it will escape and fall as a pellet of ice reaching the earth partially thawed. The size of the hailstone depends on the number of times it has passed up and down through the freezing level, on the amount of water it collected on its journey, and the extent of the thawing on its final trip downward. Hailstones as big as a hen's egg do occur; more frequently they are the size of a large pea or bean. , A 9 P \ \ o Q rocc7/A/r' t cisr/. \ b 6 > ; 1 : 9 ° ?	In addition to size, the structure of a hailstone can reveal much about its journey through the atmosphere. Often, when cut open, a hailstone will display concentric layers—each one indicating a separate ascent and freezing cycle that the hailstone underwent before falling to the ground. These layers can be clear or cloudy, depending on the speed of freezing and the types of impurities trapped within the ice as it formed. Meteorologists study these layers to understand the conditions present in the storm cloud at the time of the hailstone's formation. The dynamics within a thunderstorm are complex, involving not only updrafts and downdrafts that propel the hailstones but also varying temperatures, humidity levels, and wind patterns at different altitudes. The formation of hail is particularly associated with severe thunderstorms where strong updrafts are present. These updrafts can reach speeds of over 100 miles per hour, strong enough to keep hailstones suspended in the supercooled environment of the cloud where they grow until gravity no longer allows them to be supported by the updraft. This process of hail	1913	2006.515
He is chosen for one year, either by the Council itself or by the Cantonal Legislature. 3. The Judiciary is practically an independent judicial system, from which ordinarily no appeal can be made to the Federal Supreme Court. Nearly all the cantons (states) are divided into districts, over which are placed Prefects (Bccirksammainicr or Oberammanner or Amtsstatlhaltcr or Bezirksstatthalter) who are responsible to the state government.]	4. In addition to these Prefects, there are local magistrates or judges who handle minor legal cases directly within their communities. These magistrates are often elected by the local populace and serve terms that vary by canton. Their role is primarily to resolve low-level disputes and maintain order in accordance with cantonal laws. 5. For more serious legal matters, each canton has its own court system with multiple levels. The lowest level is typically the District Court, which handles civil and criminal cases. Appeals from the District Court can be made to the Cantonal Court, which serves as the appellate court for the region. 6. The highest court in each canton is the Cantonal Supreme Court, which reviews cases on both legal and procedural grounds. Decisions made by this court are final within the canton unless they involve federal law or constitutional issues, in which cases an appeal can be made to the Federal Supreme Court. 7. The cantonal judiciary is supported by a number of clerks, prosecutors, and other legal professionals who ensure that the judicial process runs smoothly and efficiently.

The great body of Germans had halted before the Mansion House, when General von Kleppen, the commander of the ivth Army Corps — who, it will be remembered, had landed at Weybourne — accompanied by  Lieutenant-General von Mirbach of the 8th Division, and Frolich, commander of the cavalry brigade, ascended the steps of the Mansion House and entered. Within, Sir Claude Harrison, the Lord Mayor, who wore his robes and jewel of office, received them in that great, sombre room wherein so many momentous questions concerning the welfare of the British Empire had been discussed.	"The atmosphere was tense as the German commanders, their faces marked by the rigors of combat, faced the civil authority of London. General von Kleppen, a tall man with a stern countenance, began the proceedings. ""Your Excellency,"" he addressed the Lord Mayor in heavily accented English, ""we find ourselves in a most regrettable position. Our forces have entered your city not out of desire for conflict but by the necessities imposed by war."" Sir Claude Harrison, maintaining his composure under the dire circumstances, responded with equal formality. ""General, while I understand the harsh demands of war, I must remind you that this city and its citizens are protected under the laws of war. I urge you to ensure the safety and welfare of London’s civilian population."" General von Kleppen nodded slowly, his expression unyielding yet not without a trace of respect.

"He shows how in England and France the current of events has been clearly and unmistakably socialistic in spirit. ""In the canvas for the Parliamentary election of 1010, "" he observes, ""the voters of the United Kingdom had it forced home to them by the opposition orators that the Liberals were marching straight toward socialism, that the budget proposed by them and disallowed by the Lords must, sanctioned by the vote of the people, open the way to the final expropriation of land and capital. Warning voices were heard from across the sea and from across the channel. The framer of the budget and the ministry whose existence was staked on it were roundly denounced as socialists, little as they so regard themselves."	Despite these accusations and the fervor they stirred, the electorate responded favorably to the Liberal platform, ultimately endorsing the budget and its implications. This outcome was interpreted by many as a tacit approval of a more socialist agenda, a significant shift in the political landscape of Britain. It was clear that the public was increasingly discontent with the status quo, seeking reforms that promised a fairer distribution of wealth and resources. In France, similar currents were observed, though the approach and specifics differed. The rise of syndicalism and the growing influence of socialist parties within the French parliament indicated a robust movement toward systemic change. Labor strikes and public demonstrations became more frequent, each echoing the populace’s demand for greater economic equality and governmental intervention in the regulation of industry. These events, both in England and France, were not isolated but part of a broader European context where socialism was gaining ground as a formidable political force. This shift was not merely political but also cultural, reflecting deeper changes in societal attitudes towards capitalism, property rights, and the distribution of power. The early 20th century thus marked a critical junct	1911	1997.0214
For example at an early meeting of the Sociological Society Professor Karl Pearson expressed the opinion that the birth of a science of sociology must await the obstetrical genius of some one man of the calibre of Darwin or Pasteur. At a later meeting Mr. H. G. Wells went further and maintained that as a science sociology not only does not but cannot exist. Such scepticism appears in general to be based upon the idea that a practical psychology in the sense already defined is impossible. According to some this is because the human will introduces into conduct an element necessarily incommensurable, which will always render the behaviour of man subject to the occurrence of true variety and therefore beyond the reach of scientific generalisation; according to another and a more deterministic school, human conduct while not theoretically liable to true variety in the philosophic sense or to the intrusion of the will as a first cause, is in fact so complex that no reduction of it to a complete system of generalisations will be possible until science in general has made very great progress beyond its present position.	Indeed, the debates surrounding the establishment of sociology as a science reflect a deeper philosophical struggle about the predictability and measurability of human behavior. Mr. Wells' assertion underscores the intrinsic unpredictability and individuality of human actions, suggesting that these qualities inherently resist scientific categorization and prediction. On the other hand, proponents like Professor Pearson believe that with the right intellectual breakthrough, akin to Darwin's in biology, these complexities could eventually be unraveled by a systematic scientific approach. This divergence of opinions also highlights the tension between humanistic perspectives, which emphasize the unique, irreducible aspects of human experience, and scientific perspectives, which seek patterns and laws applicable across different instances. As sociology continues to evolve, it wrestles with these foundational questions: Can human behavior be quantified and predicted with the same precision as natural phenomena? Can sociological phenomena be distilled into laws like those of physics or chemistry?  The challenge lies not only in the complexity of human behavior itself but also in the myriad of external influences that impact it, from cultural norms and social structures to economic conditions and individual psychology. Each of these	1908	2001.664
It is a synthetic understanding as against the analytic. The third t3rpe leaves what is perceived and turns to stored up knowledge. Such pupils do not really observe; they see in the things that which they have learned and apperceive it by the means of their conceptions. Finally, the fourth type interprets the apperceived material by feelings and emotions. Such a child projects his own life into that outer experience. The observation itself may even become falsified by fantastic additions, and the whole report thus gets a subjective character.	This subjective interpretation, while rich in emotional content, often strays far from objective accuracy, leading to a highly personalized, though potentially creative, understanding of the world. These children, with their minds deeply influenced by their inner emotions, can sometimes produce interpretations that, although not factually correct, are poetically or metaphorically resonant. They view the world through a lens tinted by their feelings, fears, and desires, which colors their perceptions and the narratives they construct about their experiences. In the classroom, this type of learner may require special attention to guide their observations towards more empirical and less biased conclusions. Teachers can help by encouraging these students to differentiate between what is objectively observable and what is interpretation influenced by personal feelings. This can be achieved through exercises that focus on factual reporting before allowing the addition of personal interpretation, thus fostering a balanced approach that values both objective observation and subjective expression. Such an educational strategy not only aids in developing critical thinking skills but also respects and nurtures the emotional intelligence of the student, acknowledging that both are essential components of a well-rounded intellectual development.	1909	2007.1681
But the real cause of a successful revolution is the decadence of the State. When the revolution breaks out there is always an unstable equilibrium among the different parties: many acts of violence are abortive, as they need an appropriate milieu, where they can set free reserves of latent force. The conception of a fatalistic evolution in humanity is only apparently true. If Cadoudal's plot against Bonaparte had succeeded, can we imagine that another general would have taken his place, and turned Europe upside down ? The role of eminent personalities is beyond the grasp of Science in its present state. It is essential to remember that the individual is powerless without the collaboration of a party disposed to action. Hence the importance of political ideas which interest a great number of people. The democratic idea is the revolutionary idea par excellence.	It appeals to the masses, promises equality, and stirs deep-seated desires for change among the populace. The potency of such ideas lies not merely in their appeal to fairness or justice, but in their ability to mobilize large segments of society who feel marginalized or oppressed under the current regime. This mobilization creates a force capable of challenging established structures, even if the immediate trigger for revolution appears to be a specific event or act of defiance. Moreover, the degeneration of a state's institutions, whether through corruption, inefficiency, or disconnection from the needs of its citizens, creates a fertile ground for revolutionary sentiments to take root. As public trust diminishes, the legitimacy of the state erodes, weakening its ability to enforce order. In such scenarios, even a small spark—a demonstration, a strike, an act of violence—can ignite a widespread movement. Thus, while individual leaders and catalytic events play significant roles in the unfolding of a revolution, their impact is contingent upon the broader socio-political context. A society primed for change, whether through economic hardship, political repression,	1908	1984.135
As has been elsewhere chronicled, the brigade of four regular battalions with their guns, and a com  pany of Engineers, which were to secure the passage of the Stort and protect the left flank of the retirement, left Saffron Walden somewhere about 10.30 p.m.. The line was clear, and they arrived at Sawbridgeworth in four long trains in a little under an hour. Their advent did not arouse the sleeping village, as the station lies nearly three quarters of a mile distant on the further side of the river. It may be noted in passing that while the Stort is but a small stream, easily fordable in most places, yet it was important, if possible, to secure the bridges to prevent delay in getting over the heavy guns and wagons of the retiring British.	The night was moonless, a thick haze covering the sky, which rendered the darkness nearly impenetrable, a circumstance that, while it added to the difficulty of the movement, also shielded the troops from the observation of any lurking enemy. The brigade, upon disembarking, moved with quiet precision. The engineers immediately set to work on the bridges, reinforcing and checking for mines or any sabotage that might have been laid by retreating forces or saboteurs. Meanwhile, the infantry battalions deployed along the banks, securing a perimeter to safeguard the engineers and artillery as they prepared for the passage. The operation was tense but executed with the efficiency characteristic of trained regulars. Scouts and sentries were posted at strategic points, their eyes piercing the darkness, alert for any sign of the enemy. The river, though narrow, was a critical point in the brigade's maneuvers, and no chances were taken in its crossing. As the engineers worked, the soft clatter of their tools mixed with the gentle flow of the Stort, the only sounds in the otherwise silent night. Occasionally, a	1906	1934.3381
As Henry George would say, the accumulating land value of a community is just as clearly God's provision for the growing needs of that community as the milk in the mother's breast is God's provision for the babe in her arms. Could we hope for the health of the babe if we were to snatch it from its mother's breast? As there is a God in heaven, we shall never have social health until we learn to do justly and to love mercy and to keep the laws of social well-being. For the ordinances of Jehovah are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold. Moreover, by them is thy servant warned: In keeping of them there is great reward. BERNARD SHAW: A PROPHET WHO LAUGHS By Francis Lamont Peirce MR. BERNARD SHAW's ways of looking at life are usually disconcerting, frequently startling, and occasionally preposterous. The cleverness of the man is as curious as it is constant.	His wit sparkles from the pages of his plays with a brilliance that often blinds us to the deep seriousness of his intent. Shaw, the iconoclast, demolishes traditional norms with a gleeful ferocity, yet beneath this revolutionary zeal lies a profound compassion for the human condition. He challenges the status quo not merely to provoke or entertain, but to stimulate thought, to question, and ultimately, to reform. His characters are not mere caricatures but embodiments of social and philosophical ideas, grappling with the contradictions of their own beliefs and the society around them. Shaw's plays are thus not just performances but dialogues, debates staged in the theater of the mind. Whether it is the critique of the class system, the questioning of romantic ideals, or the exploration of political ideologies, Shaw employs his sharp wit as a tool for social critique. Despite his often cynical portrayal of society's foibles, there is an underlying idealism in Shaw's work. He envisions a world where reason and justice prevail over tradition and prejudice. This vision, combined with his unorthodox methods and piercing humor, makes	1911	1973.3212
"Of the underground Typhlopidae, or Blind Snakes, of which there are a large number in Australia, Mr. Waite, who made a special study of the family, writes: ""The scales of these snakes are highly polished, so as to offer but little resistance to their passage through the soil. But. having no large belly plates with projecting edges, it will be evident that, without further aid, progression would be difficult; such aid is furnished by the tail. This member is very short, often no longer than the body is thick, and is provided with a horny, thornlike point directed downwards. On being pressed against the ground, this thorn provides the necessary point of resistance."" The Death Adder has a similar spine at the extremity of its tail. 153 The tongue is long, slender and forked. It can be protruded and retracted at will. When protruded it is in constant vibration."	This vibration serves not only as a sensory mechanism for detecting chemical signals in the air but also likely plays a role in the manipulation of soil as these snakes burrow. The olfactory capabilities of the Typhlopidae are highly developed, allowing them to effectively navigate and hunt in their subterranean environments despite their lack of vision. The diet of these blind snakes primarily consists of ants and termites, which they locate through the detection of the chemical trails these insects leave behind. Their small, hooked teeth are not designed for venom delivery like those of many other snakes but are instead perfectly adapted for grasping the soft bodies of their prey. Interestingly, despite their blindness, these snakes have retained small, rudimentary eyes beneath their scales. These eyes are not capable of forming images but are sensitive to changes in light intensity, which can be crucial for coordinating their circadian rhythms and possibly for detecting the presence of predators or other dangers. The reproductive habits of the Typhlopidae are also adapted to their underground life. Females lay eggs in secure, underground chambers, where the temperature and humidity are	1909	2006.3273
The motion of the propeller is derived from an electric motor, which drives through a transmission dynamometer L, used to measure the torque, and a Cardan joint with its centre on the balance axis. From this joint the motion is transmitted through a vertical rod, by means of bevel gearing, to the propeller. The balance is thus rendered entirely free from the weight of the motor. The propeller thrust produces a moment about the axis A A ; after balancing by weights the small motions are registered on a drum. The torque is measured, as stated, by the transmission dynamometer L, which is also arranged so that the small variations of torque can be recorded on a revolving cylinder. On this latter are also registered the time; the hundreds of metres of wind transmitted, from the large Richard anemometer ; and every hundred turns of the motor.	Furthermore, the setup includes a series of precision gauges and sensors that are strategically placed to capture data on various aspects of the propeller's performance and the environmental conditions affecting it. These include air pressure gauges, humidity sensors, and temperature monitors, all of which feed data continuously to a centralized computing system for real-time analysis. This allows for adjustments to be made on-the-fly, optimizing the propeller's efficiency under varying conditions. The system also features an advanced vibration analysis tool that monitors the propeller and motor for any signs of undue stress or potential failure. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the experimental setup and ensuring safety during tests. The vibration data, like the torque and thrust measurements, are meticulously recorded and correlated with other operational parameters to provide a comprehensive overview of the propeller's performance characteristics. Additionally, a high-speed camera is mounted adjacent to the setup to capture the propeller's motion in great detail. This visual data is used to verify the alignment and synchronization of the propeller with the motor, and to observe any anomalous behaviors or inefficiencies in the blade movement. 	1912	2005.1506
"The husband had apprentices in his shop or factory, the wife her apprentices in her kitchen and still room ; both the boys and the girls received a sound training and learned to do at least one thing really well. This was more truly education than, the modern method of cramming a miscellaneous mass of knowledge into a child and hoping that some of it will digest. There were other advantages in the Tudor system. The maids formed a community. They were part of a corporate body, and local rivalry, a common social life and community of work and interests, held them together and kept them alive and jolly. It is a very important thing that work should be done in a sociable and jolly sort of way. The happy worker puts infinitely more into his or her work than the worker who is ""pot boiling, "" and it should be remembered that this is true, not only of painting pictures, but also of hanging wallpaper and boiling potatoes."	Indeed, the joy derived from labor was a cornerstone of the Tudor domestic economy. Work was not merely a necessity but a part of life's rhythm, integrated seamlessly with the social and familial structures of the time. Apprenticeships under this system were not solely about skill acquisition but also about forming character, instilling discipline, and fostering a sense of belonging and community. The master-apprentice relationship was paternalistic, often extending beyond mere professional boundaries to encompass aspects of moral and ethical guidance. This system ensured that knowledge was passed down not only through formal instruction but also through the osmosis of daily interaction and observation. The young ones learned not just a trade but also the art of living, the subtleties of interacting with others, and the responsibilities of being a community member. Furthermore, this education was holistic. It did not compartmentalize learning into abstract segments disconnected from the real world but grounded knowledge in everyday activities. This approach made learning relevant and immediate, helping to cultivate a workforce that was skilled, versatile, and adaptable. In contrast, the modern education system often lacks this integration	1911	1998.0311
This juice, however, is characterised by the fact that it generally contains a very large proportion of salts or compounds which exert osmotic pressure. The state of the cells may be determined by the use of plasmolytic meth  ods in which the strength of a solution, such as cane sugar or potassium nitrate, which will balance the solution in the cell is measured, or by extracting a certain measured amount of living material which has been crushed with distilled water and after the freezing point of this extract has been found the original pressure may be calculated. The simpler process of squeezing out sap and testing its freezing point can not be used in a large number of instances since the highest pressures that can be applied fail to bring out the scanty sap from some species. The use of such methods at the Desert Laboratory demonstrates that the leaves of the creosote bush (Covillea, or Larrea) (Fig. 1) may have  Fig. 1.	osmotic pressures as high as 68 atmospheres, indicating a highly concentrated internal solution. This extreme concentration is thought to be an adaptive feature allowing these plants to survive in environments with intense heat and limited water availability. Similarly, studies on other desert-adapted species such as the saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) and the prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) have shown comparable results, with osmotic pressures well above what is typically observed in non-desert plants. These findings underscore the remarkable physiological adaptations that enable desert plants to efficiently manage their internal water reserves under harsh climatic conditions. By maintaining high solute concentrations, these plants lower the potential for water loss to the atmosphere, thus conserving moisture within their tissues even during prolonged periods of drought. Furthermore, the ability to adjust osmotic pressures dynamically in response to changing environmental conditions is a key factor in the resilience and survival of these species in their native habitats.	1911	2005.6329
A sea level atmospheric pressure field as determined by isobars symmetrically placed among plotted sea level pressure reports. vidual who is constructing the field. The numerical value of the pressure gradient may be expressed to suit the problem or taste of the individual; common usage in meteorology is a pressure unit of 3 millibars for a given number of miles, as determined from the pressure field. Every pressure field has both isobars and a pressure gradient. THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE FIELD. — The significance of a pressure field can be realised best by a study of a horizontal atmospheric pressure field. THE EFFECT OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCE 121 In Figure 74, the horizontal level chosen is sea level and the area includes part of the Pacific Coast.	In this diagram, the isobars are drawn at intervals of 5 millibars. The closer these lines are to each other, the stronger the wind speed associated with the pressure gradient. This is a fundamental principle in meteorology known as the gradient wind balance. The wind flows roughly parallel to the isobars due to the balance between the pressure gradient force, which pushes the air from high to low pressure, and the Coriolis force, which deflects moving objects such as air to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. As we examine the pressure field over the Pacific Coast, it is evident that a low-pressure system is situated offshore. This system is indicative of a cyclonic circulation, which in the northern hemisphere is characterized by counterclockwise movement of air around the center of the low. Such systems are commonly associated with cloudier, more unstable weather conditions including increased chances of precipitation. The presence of this low-pressure system could potentially influence weather patterns significantly, leading to cooler temperatures and increased wind speeds as air rushes inward toward the lower pressure center	1913	1971.2245
Everywhere through London and its vicinity, as well as in Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Coventry, Leeds, and Liverpool, motor cars and motor omnibuses from dealers and private owners were being requisitioned by the military authorities, for they would, it was believed, replace cavalry to a very large extent. Wild and extraordinary reports were circulated regarding the disasters in the north. Hull, Newcastle, Gateshead, and Tynemouth had, it was believed, been bombarded and sacked. The shipping in the Tyne was burning, and the Elswick works were held by the enemy. Details were, however, very vague, as the Germans were taking every precaution to prevent information reaching London. CHAPTER III Terror and excitement reigned everywhere. The wildest rumours were hourly afloat.	The streets were thronged with anxious faces, each person seeking tidbits of news to share or confirm their fears. Newspapers sold out within minutes of hitting the stands, their headlines screaming of invasion and destruction. The city was in a state of palpable tension, with families huddled around radios, clinging to every word broadcasted. In the governmental corridors, the atmosphere was no less charged. Emergency meetings convened one after another, with officials pouring over maps and dispatches, their faces grim with the weight of decisions. The call for volunteers echoed through the streets, and men of all ages lined up, ready to defend their homes and country. Amidst this chaos, misinformation bred like wildfire. Reports of parachutists landing in the countryside, of spies disguised as nuns, and of imminent chemical attacks circulated, each adding layers to the public's fear. The city's air raid sirens wailed intermittently, sending everyone scrambling for shelter, their hearts pounding with the dread of what might come from the skies. Yet in the midst of despair, there were also tales of heroism	1906	1994.383
"They even refrained from noting the challenge in his tone with which he announced the fact that he was having a new suit of clothes made. And when William asked, pertly, ""Striped or polka dotted?"" his mother gave him a glance of significant warning. Except for the flowing tie, the cap and shoes, Frederick seemed normal enough. Besides, at the house of a friend he had met a kindred soul in the person of a girl named Eleanor Paine. When he had first been introduced she had asked, ""Are you an artist?"" ""No, "" Frederick answered. ""If you are referring to my tie, I am merely the martyr for a cause."" At which he unfolded the theory of  792 clothes, which he had been elaborating, to the ears of his first sympathetic listener. Eleanor clapped her hands together and cried, ""Oh, lovely!"""	"Her enthusiasm was infectious, and for the first time, Frederick felt validated in his eccentric fashion choices. He proceeded to explain how each item of clothing represented a particular philosophical stance, a silent protest against the conformity of modern attire. Eleanor nodded vigorously, her eyes alight with interest as she followed his every word. ""Each piece,"" Frederick continued, ""is a statement, a piece of the puzzle that forms my worldview. The cap, for instance, is a nod to the working-class men who built this city, while the shoes—those are a touch of the dandy, a rebellion against the drudgery of expected male fashion."" Eleanor's laughter rang clear and bright. ""And the tie?"" she asked, her tone teasing yet genuinely curious. ""The tie,"" Frederick paused for effect, ""is my banner. It's loud, it's unconventional, and it disrupts. Just like art, it's meant to provoke thought, to stir emotions."" The conversation flowed effortlessly from there, with Eleanor sharing her own passions and views on art, culture, and society. They discussed everything"	1913	1997.7124
"How nice to be a male anti feminist, and have half the world's population to despise. These are the menus plaisirs one must renounce in embracing theories of liberty. Another remarkable book that deals with the royalty of commoners is James Stephens' "" The Charwoman's Daughter."" This year I shall date the coming of spring from the day I read this book. And, indeed, it is like a wood being awakened by spring."	"The prose is fresh and lively, stirring the imagination as the season stirs the buds to bloom. Stephens, with his keen observation and gentle wit, paints a portrait of life so vivid, it is as if the reader walks the streets alongside his characters. In the story of Mary Makebelieve, we delve into the everyday magic and struggle of an ordinary life, finding there a richness often overlooked. It is a celebration of the mundane, transformed into the extraordinary through the eyes of its protagonist, a testament to the quiet dignity and resilience of those who are frequently invisible in grand narratives. As one turns the pages, it becomes apparent how Stephens' narrative weaves a delicate tapestry of human emotions, with threads of humor and poignancy. The charm of ""The Charwoman's Daughter"" lies not just in its storytelling but in its ability to elevate the ordinary, reminding us that every life has its own royalty, deserving of recognition and reverence. This perspective challenges the reader to reconsider their own views on society and the roles we all play within it. Thus, the book not only marks the season"	1911	1994.9095
There is nothing exact about such statements, as they may vary as much as different soils do from one another. The following table shows approximately the amount of plant food materials removed in one year from the soil of an acre of land fully stocked with thrifty trees. This includes the amount contained in the new wood, foliage and fruit: PLANT FOOD REMOVED FROM THE SOIL BY ONE ACRE IN  ORCHARD. Nitrogen Phos. Acid Potash Lime Magnesium  Ibs. Ibs. Ibs. Ibs.	Ibs. Ibs. 48 12 60 45 20 These figures represent a considerable drain on the soil's fertility, and underscore the necessity for thoughtful and systematic fertilization to sustain productivity. It is also important to note that the amounts can vary depending on the type of fruit trees, the age of the orchard, and the specific growing conditions such as climate and soil type. For instance, younger trees or those in their prime bearing years might extract different quantities of nutrients compared to older, less productive trees. Similarly, apple trees may require different nutrient amounts compared to peach or cherry trees. This variability makes tailored soil management and fertilization strategies critical for maintaining a healthy orchard. Furthermore, regular soil tests are essential to accurately determine the current nutrient levels and to guide the application of fertilizers. This not only helps in meeting the exact nutritional needs of the trees but also prevents the excessive use of fertilizers, which can lead to runoff and environmental pollution. Thus, understanding the nutrient uptake is crucial for sustainable orchard management and optimal fruit production.	1914	2003.9098
Of all the unpopular acts of Mr. Taft, from the evil hour when, after giving his unqualified endorsement to the Pain aldrich tariff abomination, he volunteered a clean bill of health for Senator Aldrich, it is doubtful if anything has aroused the popular indignation more than the removal of the incorruptible and faithful Glavis and the retention of Bal linger, the friend of the interests that were trying to despoil the United States of much of its most valuable remaining public land. The last election was the people's reply to this exhibition of the Bourbon spirit on the part of the President, and the resignation of Richard Ballinger rather than run the risk of impeachment by the House, is the first and most significant positive fruit of the autumn election. low let the Democrats and progressive Republicans unite on a line of progressive and fundamentally democratic measures, and other popular and beneficent victories will quickly follow, in spite of the strongly reactionary sympathies of the President and the united efforts of Wall Street, the political bosses and the manipulators of the money controlled machine.	The outcry against these political maneuvers has transcended party lines, drawing support from every corner of the nation and every walk of life. Indeed, the sentiment of the public has shifted markedly, with a growing demand for transparency, accountability, and a genuine commitment to the stewardship of national resources. This popular revolt is not merely against individual policies or personalities but represents a broader rejection of the old guard's ways of conducting government—ways that have seemed more aligned with private interests than with the common good. As we move forward, it is imperative that this coalition of progressives and reform-minded conservatives harnesses this momentum to implement policies that not only protect our natural heritage but also promote economic fairness and social justice. The focus must be on crafting legislation that ensures the equitable distribution of resources, safeguards the environment, and curtails the undue influence of corporate power in politics. The task ahead is daunting, yet the path is clear. The American people have voiced their demand for change—a change that respects the principles upon which this great country was founded and that responds to the needs and aspirations of its citizens. Let this be a	1911	1987.4692
"The first consideration, then, must be the order in which the great natural groups of phenomena have manifested themselves in creation, that is, in the great evolutionary process. Evolution has been described as that view of the universe which assumes that a vast, uniform, uninterrupted process of development obtains throughout all nature; and that all natural phenomena without exception, from the motions of the heavenly bodies and the fall of a rolling stone to the growth of plants and the consciousness of men, obey one and the same great law of causation Science, to be sure, has •Spencer, ""The Classification of the Sciences, "" ""Essays, "" Vol. III., p. 10. 'See Ward, ""Dynamic Sociology, "" Vol. I., p. 106; also ""Applied Sociology, "" p. 306. • Haeckel, ""Freedom in Science and Teaching, "" Chap. I."	This concept of evolution, while not without its critics and controversies, has been instrumental in shaping modern scientific thought. It suggests a continuity and connectivity in the natural world that transcends the individual disciplines of science, linking geology with biology, chemistry with physics, and so forth. Moreover, it implies that the historical sequence of events is crucial in understanding the current state of any given phenomenon or entity.  Thus, according to evolutionary theory, life on Earth began from simple, single-celled organisms which gradually evolved into more complex multicellular organisms. This biological evolution continued, producing the diverse array of species observed today. Parallel to biological evolution, there has been the evolution of the Earth itself, with geological processes shaping the continents and climates, which in turn influence the course of biological evolution.  The implications of this perspective are profound, not only for the natural sciences but for the social sciences as well. It compels us to consider human society and culture as products of a long evolutionary history, influenced by both biological and environmental factors. Just as species adapt to their environments, so too do human societies, though	1911	1995.9584
"She sat down with firmness in her every move. "" Oh!"" Mr. Tate came an unwilling step nearer. ""About Barbara."" Mr. Tate sat, but on the side of a chair and with his body inclining slightly toward the door. "" She has an absurd notion, "" Harriet began, "" that she ought to stay here with you. Now I want you to tell her it is quite unnecessary."" Mr. Tate leapt at the word. "" I will, Harriet. I think it is quite unnecessary, VOL. CXXVII. — No. 758.-36 I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, RANDOLPH "" too."	"But you know how Barbara is—stubborn as a mule once she sets her mind to something."" Harriet nodded, her lips pressed tightly together, a sign Mr. Tate had learned to recognize as her gathering resolve. ""Yes, I'm aware. But it's high time she learned that her responsibilities now lie elsewhere. With her own family. With her children."" Mr. Tate rubbed his forehead wearily. ""I know, I know. It's just—"" ""Just what, Randolph?"" Harriet's voice was sharp, slicing through his hesitation. He sighed, looking toward the window as if the answer might be written in the play of sunlight across the garden. ""It's just that she feels guilty, I suppose. After her mother passed, she took it upon herself to be everything to everyone here. It's become her identity in a way."" Harriet's gaze softened momentarily before she recomposed her features into their usual firm set. ""Guilty or not, it's not healthy. Not for her, and certainly not for her children. They need their mother, Randolph"	1913	1991.9336
He took down the picture of Christ which stood over the gate of the palace and substituted for it a plain cross, accompanied by an inscription, a part of which is as follows: ' The Emperor can not endure that Christ should be sculptured as a mute and lifeless image graven on earthly materials. But Leo, and his young son Constantine, have at their gates engraven the thrice blessed representation of the cross, the glory of believing monarchs.' * These edicts aroused a storm of opposition, and the servants who took down the picture were killed by a mob. Rebellions burst out in the Greek Archipelago, and Pope Gregory of Rome openly defied the Emperor. However, in his own empirt Leo was strong enough to enforce his decrees. 1 'Hist. Christ. Church 4. 454.	He continued to press forward with his policies of iconoclasm, systematically removing and destroying religious images which he deemed idolatrous. The backlash was fierce, not only from the populace but also from many within the Church who viewed icons as a vital part of Christian practice and devotion. Monasteries became centers of resistance, where monks hid and preserved icons, and many were punished for their defiance. Despite the widespread dissent, Leo's conviction remained unshaken. He argued that the veneration of icons equated to idolatry, a practice strictly forbidden by the Ten Commandments. He believed that his actions were in the best interest of a purer form of Christianity, one that emphasized worship directed solely towards God, unmediated by material representations. His campaign against icons led to the period known in history as the Byzantine Iconoclasm, which lasted over a century, spanning the reigns of several emperors. It was a time marked by religious and political turmoil, which deeply influenced the cultural and theological landscape of the Byzantine Empire. The conflict over icons intensified divisions between the Eastern	1904	1997.0107
". . ."" — O'Shea, ""Dynamic Factors in Education, "" p. 151.  means either the perpetuation of a form of science instruction that has proved a failure in the high school or it means a reformed science, such as many teachers are now advocating, that introduces industrial applications. If the latter kind is contemplated it should be unnecessary to provide for it again in the agricultural course, for to admit that it can not be so utilised is to take all of the meaning out of the reform."	The problem, then, becomes one of integration rather than duplication. It is essential that the curriculum not only address the theoretical aspects of science but also demonstrate its practical applications in agriculture and industry. This dual focus will prepare students for real-world challenges and enable them to apply their knowledge in various contexts, thereby making education both relevant and comprehensive. Furthermore, the reformed science curriculum should encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It should not be a mere transfer of knowledge, but a dynamic process that engages students actively, making them participants in their own learning journey. By doing this, education becomes a tool not just for personal development but also for societal advancement. In conclusion, if the reformed science involves a practical, application-oriented approach as proposed, then incorporating it into the agricultural course would enhance the students' understanding and proficiency. This would eliminate redundancy and ensure that educational resources are utilized to foster a more holistic and effective learning environment.	1911	2007.0784
The treatise is divided into four major sections, in which are considered at length and luminously the function, equipment and chief ideals of the teacher, and his place in society and the state. The volume merits the widest possible circulation. * All books Intended for review should be addressed to B. O. Flower, 5 Park Square, Boston, Mass. 664 Seekers After Soul. By John O. Knott, Ph. D. Cloth. Pp. 208. Price, $1.20 net. Boston: Sherman, French & Company.	"This work, a profound exploration into the nature of human consciousness and spirituality, delves into the philosophical and psychological aspects of the soul's existence. Dr. Knott, with his extensive background in both fields, provides a compelling argument for the soul as a vital force in human experience, distinguishing it from the mere functions of the brain. He discusses the soul's potential for growth and enlightenment, its connection to the universe, and its impact on personal identity and morality. In his analysis, Dr. Knott utilizes a variety of sources, from ancient texts to modern scientific studies, creating a well-rounded discourse that is both scholarly and accessible. His writing is clear and thoughtful, with each chapter building upon the last to form a cohesive argument about the soul's integral role in life's meaning and purpose. ""Seekers After Soul"" is not only a philosophical treatise but also a guide for those looking to explore the deeper aspects of their being. It encourages readers to reflect on their own perceptions of consciousness and to consider the broader implications of soulful living in a predominantly materialistic society.

The saddest scenes were to be witnessed at the Royal Infirmary, in Infirmary Road, at the Royal Hospital in West Street, and even in some of the vacant wards in the Jessop Hospital for Women in Victoria Street, which had to be requisitioned for the accommodation of the crowds of wounded of both nations, so constantly being brought in by carts, carriages, motor cars, and even cabs. The St. John's Ambulance Brigade, with many ladies, were doing all they could to render aid, while the Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute for Nurses was called upon for all available help. Every place where sick could be accommodated, including the well-known George Woofindin Convalescent Home, was crowded to overflowing with sufferers, while every doctor in Sheffield bore his part in unceasing surgical work. But the number of dead on both sides it was impossible to estimate.	The streets leading to these medical facilities were lined with anxious relatives and citizens, all seeking news of loved ones or offering their assistance in any way possible. Volunteers distributed water, food, and blankets, trying to provide comfort in the midst of chaos. Churches and community centers opened their doors to provide refuge for those displaced by the conflict, and prayers were held continuously, pleading for peace and healing. Amidst the turmoil, stories of heroism and compassion emerged. Nurses and doctors worked tirelessly, many without sleep for days, fighting to save lives with limited resources. Citizens donated blood and medical supplies, and local businesses provided meals for healthcare workers and families of the wounded. The community's solidarity was palpable, as everyone came together to support one another in this time of dire need. Yet, the air was heavy with grief as the toll of the conflict became more apparent. Families received devastating news, and the impact of loss was seen in the tear-streaked faces of those who waited outside the hospitals. The city, known for its industrious spirit, was now bonded by a collective heartache and	1906	1998.0275
"The dynamic quality of common life has made that life, with all its varied experience, the very content of fiction, so eagerly assimilated and embodied by Frank Norris and his worthy successors, in novels which, though dealing with business, politics, and finance, belong even more truly to creative literature than many of those portraying social manners or dramatising the vicissitudes of married life. To our modern sense of life, the world, since it is so living in us and is so human a world, cannot be ""too much with us."" Our sensibility, too, would be a sterile field if it did not enfold our elemental natures more intimately as well as more wisely than even the habit of barbarian or primitive.

He boasted so much that soon everyone in the forest knew of his deed. But pride, as it often does, led to downfall. One day, while spreading tales of his great exploits at the edge of the meadow, Mr. Rabbit encountered Mr. Fox. Sly Mr. Fox, ever the opportunist, saw a chance to flatter Mr. Rabbit’s ego and perhaps gain a meal in the process. “Mr. Rabbit,” said Mr. Fox with a grin, “I've heard of your remarkable feat, and I must say, I am most impressed. Surely a rabbit as noble as yourself must celebrate such accomplishments. Why don’t you come to my den this evening for a little party in your honor?” Mr. Rabbit, blinded by his vanity, agreed without a second thought. That evening, he followed Mr. Fox to his den. There, Mr. Fox offered him some fermented berries. Mr. Rabbit, never having had such delicacies before, indulged far too heartily. Before long, he was so befuddled that he could barely hop straight.

An open-headed tree is objectionable when it is subjected to heavy winds or snowfalls, as the open structure may lead to breakage or damage. Additionally, in fruit trees, an excessively open head can result in reduced productivity due to overexposure of the fruit to sunlight, causing sunburn or uneven ripening. 3. An open head is desirable in circumstances where air circulation is needed to prevent fungal diseases, or in dense orchards where light penetration is necessary for the lower branches. It also facilitates easier harvesting and maintenance activities. 4. Pruning should commence when the tree is young to establish a strong, desirable form and eliminate weak or competing branches. Early pruning should be moderate to encourage a strong, well-shaped framework for the tree's future growth. 5. A low head is desirable as it makes the tree easier to manage and harvest, and can help in protecting the tree from wind damage. The first branches should ideally start from at least 18 to 24 inches above the ground to allow for cultural practices like cultivation and mulching without damaging the tree. 6.

A vindictive prosecution had the favour of still other circumstances. Party feeling ran high. The prosecution was in the hands of the members of the opposing party, whose official power enabled them to tempt Lindsay with easily redeemable promises of immunity; and these men were of that malodorous coterie in the Republican Party of New York whose intimacy with Chester A. Arthur made people hope, when he afterward came into the Presidency, that he would imitate Henry V. by turning a cold shoulder to his old cronies. A rancorous criminal prosecution seemed possible, therefore, and intimations were not lacking, through leaks in the District Attorney's office, that it was certain.	Moreover, the public's attention was captivated not just by the political machinations but by the spectacle of a man like Lindsay, once held in high regard, now caught in the crossfire of a bitterly partisan struggle. The newspapers, ever eager for a scandal, churned out stories daily, each headline more sensational than the last. This media frenzy only added fuel to the fire, influencing public opinion and, arguably, the proceedings themselves. In the courtrooms, the atmosphere was thick with tension and anticipation. Witnesses were paraded in and out, offering testimonies that were often contradictory and colored by their political affiliations. The evidence, such as it was, seemed muddled by personal vendettas and political paybacks, making it increasingly difficult to discern the truth of the matter. Lindsay's defense, aware of the uphill battle they faced, argued vehemently against the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses, suggesting that their testimonies were tainted by the same promises of immunity that hung over Lindsay's head. They pointed out inconsistencies in the prosecution's case and accused them of misconduct, all in	1911	1960.1007
"Daniel Webster, as the exponent of constitutional liberty, said that ""the greed and selfishness of a moneyed aristocracy and the concentration of great wealth in the hands of a few caused the downfall of the Roman Empire."" Horace Greeley, though loving so dearly his country's flag and humankind, in the fervency of his anxiety to arouse his fellow citizens to the great crime of human slavery, was impelled to write: ""Flag of the free? tear down the flaunting lie; Let slavery's polluted rag insult no sunny sky."" There are occasions in human experience when instead of being guided by tameness of ordinary argument, our higher sense of justice and equity is set ablaze by the force of the soul."	It is in these moments that individuals and nations alike are called to stand upon the precipice of change, to choose between the stagnant comfort of the status quo or the tumultuous path of reform and righteousness. Such was the case during the times of Webster and Greeley, where the fabric of society was strained under the weight of its own contradictions — liberty proclaimed but not practiced, equality promised yet not provided. This same spirit of confrontational truth echoes through the ages, finding relevance in every generation that faces its own crises of morality and justice. Whether addressing the chains of bondage, the suffrage of the oppressed, or the preservation of natural rights against the encroachments of overreaching authority, the essence remains unchanged. It is the call to rise above the mundane complacencies of everyday politics, to reject the easy lies of convenience, and to embrace the sometimes painful truths that lead to genuine progress. Thus, as we reflect on the words of these great figures from our past, let us not be content with mere remembrance. Instead, let us carry forward their legacy by actively engaging in the	1911	1924.631
The life of worship and mystery went on about me. The muezzin called for noonday prayer, and the imams chanted the sen ice, musically, under the great dome. Absorbed in the painting of marble against a sky of delicate blue, the sense of danger had been lulled to sleep in me by the somnolent chant of the holy man repeating his Koran near the grille. Suddenly his chant ceased. I heard hurrying feet and looked up to see a police captain and two men, followed by a number of priests, a noisy mob at their heels, making toward me. I kept my seat and regarded the captain quietly. With unmistakable gesture, but in a language that I did not understand, he ordered me out of the place. But I remained seated, and indicated that I did not comprehend either his word or his meaning, and painted a stroke or two to show my unconcern. My coolness affected him.	"He paused for a moment, visibly uncertain, before he addressed me again, this time in broken English. ""You must go now. Not safe here. Come."" His tone softened slightly, perhaps in recognition of my calm demeanor or perhaps out of respect for my obvious foreignness. I looked around, taking in the faces of the priests and the growing crowd. Their expressions were a mix of curiosity, concern, and in some cases, outright hostility. It was clear that my presence in such a sacred space, as an obvious outsider and engaged in such an earthly activity as painting, had disrupted the usual peace. Realizing that the situation might escalate if I continued to ignore the captain's commands, I began to pack up my paints and brushes slowly, maintaining my composed exterior. As I rose to my feet, the captain nodded to me, a gesture of thanks for complying, and motioned for his men to back off slightly. ""We escort you out,"" he said, a protective edge to his voice now. The crowd parted reluctantly as the captain and his men formed a barrier around me. As we"	1913	1970.9427

A man must be the soul of any plan To bring the future up to higher light, To bridge the gap between the dark and bright, And shape a world more fitting for all span. Yet, who but artists, with their broader view, Who see beyond the hill, the sky, the field, Can render visions that the unseen yield, And paint the colors of the ethereal hue? They play with shadows, with the light they dance, Bring forth the hidden to the common eye, Make palpable the dreams that sleeping lie— A vital service in this vast expanse. For what is progress, if it lacks the dream? The sculptor's chisel, the sweet poet's pen, The painter’s brush, bring forth the now and then, Uniting streams to one transcendent stream.

"Boston was full of German infantry, and officers had taken up temporary quarters in the Peacock and the other hotels in the marketplace, while upon the "" stump "" the enemy's colours were flying. No news came from London. People in Norwich, Ipswich, Yarmouth, and other places heard vaguely of the invasion in the North, and of fighting in which the Germans were careful to report that they were always successful. They saw the magnificently equipped army of the Kaiser, and, comparing it with our mere apology for military force, regarded the issue as hopeless from the very first. In every town the German colours were displayed, and all kinds of placards in German and in English made their appearance."	These placards demanded the cooperation and obedience of the local population, warning of severe penalties for any acts of resistance or sabotage against the occupying forces. They also promised protection and fair treatment for those who complied peacefully with the new order. The streets, once bustling with daily commerce and the lively chatter of locals, now echoed with the disciplined march of boots and the occasional harsh command in German. In the quieter corners of these towns, whispers of resistance began to stir among some of the braver souls. Secret meetings were held in dimly lit back rooms and secluded barns, where plans were cautiously laid out to undermine the occupiers' efforts and to gather intelligence to send to what remained of the British forces. The sense of national pride, deeply wounded by the sight of foreign flags fluttering above their heads, fueled their determination. Yet, for many, the presence of the German army instilled a deep-seated fear, and the daily sight of their imposing patrols and the stern faces of their officers served as a constant reminder of their power and control. The uncertainty of London's fate only added to the	1906	1953.0194
At various times the author has had the opportunity of making illumination tests at a large number of stations of varying importance, the results of which are interesting as indicating the condition prevailing at the present time. These results are set out in Table IV. be congratulated on the excellent results ; especially good are the stations where 100 c. p. tungsten lamps, with obscured lower parts, are used, suspended in large opal glass shades. Not only is the average minimum illumination good, namely, -3 foot candles, but the maximum, which was generally found to be 2-5, is not excessive, and there is no doubt that the cost is very moderate, as the total candle power or watts per 1,000 ft. of platform is about 3,500, and the consumption of energy is comparatively low. As the sources of light on tube stations must TABLE IV. Test Lines.	Station Name | Average Minimum Illumination (foot candles) | Average Maximum Illumination (foot candles) | Total Candle Power or Watts per 1,000 ft. of platform ---|---|---|--- Central Station | 0.3 | 2.5 | 3500 West End Station | 0.4 | 2.8 | 3400 North Line Station | 0.2 | 2.2 | 3600 South Junction | 0.5 | 3.0 | 3300 East Terminal | 0.3 | 2.6 | 3450 These figures reveal that while there is a consistency in achieving adequate minimum illumination, there is room for improvement in reducing the variability of the maximum illumination levels, ensuring a more uniform lighting environment. The use of 100 c.p. tungsten lamps in large opal glass shades has proven effective, striking a balance between sufficient light and energy efficiency. Further adjustments and standardization of fixtures across all stations could enhance overall lighting quality and reduce operational costs. Given the	1912	1970.9349

And from (8a) we may write — , yx = (x X slope at X) — (moment of Axe about A) • ("") remembering that Axe is a negative quantity. Probably the form (10) is more convenient than (n), A being a constant."	The integral forms in equations (a) and (8) can be further manipulated to provide a clearer understanding of the behavior of the beam under various loading conditions. If we assume a uniformly distributed load along the length of the beam, the moment Mx at a distance x from the fixed end A can be expressed as \( Mx = \frac{w x^2}{2} \), where w is the load per unit length. Substituting this into equation (10), the deflection yx becomes: \[ yx = x \times \text{(slope at A)} + \frac{w x^3}{6} \] This equation, derived from the bending moment equation, shows that the deflection at any point x is directly proportional to the cube of the distance from the fixed end, indicating that deflection increases significantly towards the free end of the beam. To further explore the implications of this deflection formula, consider the boundary condition at the fixed end (x = 0), where both deflection yx and slope must be zero. This condition ensures that the	1908	1990.7711
Thus the work of enlightenment was actually going on in the period before direct tutelage began. Under the British control, however, all this is changed. The French Mission was abandoned as soon as possible; and, apart from any changes quite recently made, nothing has been systematically substituted for it beyond the dispatch of a few Egyptian teachers to an English normal school. At the same time the former teaching of the sciences in Arabic has been abolished. Law is still taught in French and to some extent in Arabic — the latter for ecclesiastical purposes — but the physical sciences are with hardly any exception taught solely in English; and in the secondary schools botany, biology, and physiology are not taught at all. In the school of agriculture, all the teachers use English.	This shift towards English as the medium of instruction for scientific subjects has significant implications. It not only changes the accessibility of education for those not proficient in English, but it also impacts the cultural orientation of the curriculum. The dominance of English in the educational system reflects broader political and economic influences exerted by British colonial administration. This transition has meant that students must now navigate not only the complexities of scientific concepts but also the additional barrier of language, which may not be their mother tongue. Moreover, the focus on English marginalizes the local linguistic and cultural context, potentially alienating students from their own heritage and making the educational content seem foreign and less relevant to their everyday lives. The emphasis on English underscores a colonial legacy that values Western knowledge and modes of instruction over local traditions and languages, thus perpetuating a form of cultural imperialism. Despite these challenges, the use of English does provide some opportunities, such as greater access to the vast body of scientific literature predominantly published in English and potentially better prospects in the global job market. However, the benefits come at the cost of reduced local relevance and increased dependency on foreign educational	1908	2007.1488

Approximately p = c, ."	where c is a constant determined by the physical properties and design parameters of the section. This dynamic efficiency is critical for understanding how effectively the section converts kinetic energy from the fluid into useful mechanical energy, which is essential for the performance of many engineering systems like turbines, pumps, and propellers. The value of c can vary significantly depending on the Reynolds number, the roughness of the surface, and the geometric configuration of the section. It is often necessary to conduct empirical studies or detailed simulations to accurately determine c for a specific application or design. The role of the coefficients Kᵥ and Kᵤ, as presented, is to refine the understanding of how variations in velocity and pressure fields across the section influence the overall efficiency. These coefficients are integral in calculating the differential changes in velocity and pressure, which are then used to assess the performance under varying operational conditions. Thus, the equations provided by Sol'eau offer a methodical approach to evaluate the mechanical efficiency of sections interacting with fluid flows, allowing designers to optimize configurations for maximum energy conversion and minimal losses. This is particularly vital in the development of	1912	1982.6066
The Carson valley is located in western Nevada, close to the eastern slopes of the great Sierra Nevada range, that majestic mountain barrier that secludes California from the rest of the worlds Here there are more than a 'hundred peaks which climb heavenward from 10,000 feet above the level of the sea, and many of them reach to the height of 12,000, 13,000 and even 14,000 feet. Naturally such a mountain  202  HEAD gate DROP, TRUCKEE carson PROJECT range is the home of perpetual snow fields which feed a score or more of mountain lakes, some of which, as Lakes Tahoe, Donner and Independence, have become world famed because of their Alpine beauty and exquisite summer allurements. Fed by Lake Tahoe and other lakes are the Carson and Truckee Rivers, which, allowed to run in natural wantonness, have scattered their waters where they were evaporated, giving man no particular benefit from their existence.	Yet, with the advent of human ingenuity, these wild rivers have been tamed and harnessed to serve the arid valleys and the bustling towns that lie in their paths. The creation of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, one of the first federal reclamation projects initiated under the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, transformed the Carson Valley. This project diverted the waters from these rivers through a series of canals and reservoirs, turning the once barren desert into fertile farmland ripe for cultivation. The landscape, once dominated by sagebrush and arid wasteland, now blooms with alfalfa, wheat, and cantaloupes, supporting a thriving agricultural economy. The once sporadic settlements have grown into robust communities, with farmers and their families living in a symbiosis with the land that was once thought to be inhospitable. The transformation of the Carson Valley is a testament to human determination and the potential to harness nature for the benefit of civilization. Yet, this reclamation has not been without its challenges. Water rights disputes and the ecological consequences of altering	1911	1988.7241
Right up to this time people gather in knots on the pavement, and earlier in the evening the crowd is often very dense. The upper windows are shown illuminated in this photograph, but have been undressed. They are, however, always fully dressed until six o'clock, and provide an attractive spectacle for people riding on the tops of buses. Fig. 1 shows a general view of the whole frontage, and Figs. 2, 3 and 4 show typical windows. The photographs bring out the excellence of the lighting, and do justice to the striking appearance of the display, but, of course, can give no idea of the exquisite mingling of colours to be seen.	The windows, each adorned with meticulously arranged merchandise, are designed to catch the eye of every passerby. During the day, the sun enhances the vibrancy of the fabrics and the gleam of polished metals, while at night, the electric lights inside each window cast a warm, inviting glow onto the street. It is a common sight to see individuals pausing, their attention captured by the latest fashions or the newest gadgets on display. Children press their noses against the glass, enchanted by the intricate toy displays or seasonal decorations that change with the festivities of the year. Each window tells a story, carefully curated by the store's visual merchandisers. Fig. 2 captures a spring theme, with floral prints and pastel colors dominating the scene. Fig. 3 offers a contrast, showcasing autumnal hues and cozy home goods that suggest warmth and comfort as the seasons change.

"Its master never strikes, but merely threatens it. He caresses it like a child, and kisses it on the mouth. Though the Dingo is treated so well it often runs away, especially in  the pairing season, and at such times it never returns. Thus it never becomes perfectly domesticated, still is very useful to the natives, for it has a keen scent and traces every kind of game; it never barks, and hunts less wildly than our dogs, but very rapidly, frequently capturing the game on the run. The Dingo will follow nobody else but its owner."" In this part of North Queensland, the Dingo is used in hunting the Cassowary. Other travellers give a similar account. When these half tamed animals come into contact with the white man's dogs, there are free fights, but they also freely interbreed. In fact it is now a difficult thing to obtain a pure Dingo in Australia."	The intermingling of breeds has resulted in a variety of hybrid dogs that possess characteristics of both the Dingo and the more domesticated breeds introduced by settlers. These hybrids often display a mix of the Dingo's independence and resilience with the more trainable and sociable nature of domestic dogs. This blending has created animals uniquely suited to the Australian landscape, capable of handling both the harsh wilderness and the demands of human companionship. However, the dilution of the pure Dingo gene pool has raised concerns among conservationists and researchers. Efforts are now being made to identify and preserve the remaining pure Dingoes, which are considered vital for maintaining the ecological balance. They play a crucial role in controlling populations of smaller animals and thus help to prevent overgrazing of vegetation. Despite these conservation efforts, the challenge remains significant due to the vastness of the Australian outback and the Dingo's natural propensity to roam over large territories. The situation is further complicated by the often negative perception of Dingoes as pests by farmers and ranchers, who blame them for attacks on livestock. This conflict has led to	1909	2007.28

November 9th saw the continuation of the high-pressure system, but with a slight shift eastward, introducing somewhat cooler temperatures and a steady increase in wind velocity by late afternoon. The gradient wind, still predominantly westerly, began to show signs of shifting towards the northwest as the pressure gradient tightened slightly due to a deepening low over the North Atlantic. By 7 A.M., wind speeds at ground level were recorded at 3 meters per second, gradually increasing to 5 meters per second by 6 P.M.

To silence the lightship, which was known to be in German hands, a fast destroyer was dispatched with orders to torpedo it and destroy it. As the enemy had undoubtedly taken the alarm, and might be expected any minute to put in an appearance, the British cruisers made ready to retire. The destroyers were sent off to the north ; the three remaining armoured cruisers hovered waiting for the Germans to show, as they intended to draw them off towards the northeast, and thus take them away from the Bulgaria and her escort. At 4.20 a.m.. a big ship, evidently an armoured cruiser, accompanied by two or three destroyers, was seen approaching from the direction of Hull. Simultaneously wireless waves came in strong from the south, and from that quarter there came into sight another big armoured cruiser, accompanied by at least six destroyers and two smaller cruisers.	The British fleet, now caught between two formidable enemy groups, had to make a swift decision. The Admiral, realizing the precariousness of their position, ordered an immediate change in formation. The cruisers were to form a line ahead, speeding towards the northeast, while the destroyers were to engage the enemy vessels to delay their advance and protect the flank. The sea was rough, adding to the difficulty of maneuvering, and the grey dawn light made visibility poor. As the British ships increased their speed, the pounding of the engines mixed with the crashing of the waves against the hulls. The German ships, relentless in their pursuit, began firing at long range. Shells splashed into the sea around the British cruisers, sending up columns of water and shrapnel. The British return fire was swift. The gunners, well-trained and calm under pressure, targeted the leading German cruiser, aiming to take out its artillery. A direct hit was scored, and smoke began to billow from the enemy ship, slowing its advance but not disabling it completely. Meanwhile, the destroyers executed a	1906	1924.3983
In danger of all being brought to action and destroyed if they kept together, the German liners scattered at 4.15 : the Deutschland steered southeast to pass between the Kincardine shire and the Lion ; the Kaiser Wilhelm steered boldly for a destroyer which was closing in on her from the starboard bow; and the Kronprinz Wilhelm ran due north. The Deutschland, racing along at a tremendous speed, passed between the Kincardineshire and the Lion. The Lion at long range put three 9.2 inch shells into her without stopping her; the Kincardineshire gave her a broadside from her 6 inch guns at about 5000 yards, and hit her several times.	The Deutschland, however, maintained her speed, although smoke began to billow from her aft deck, indicating some damage. The crew worked feverishly to manage the damage while the captain kept her on a steady course, determined to outrun the pursuing ships. Meanwhile, the Kaiser Wilhelm, taking a daring approach, charged directly towards the destroyer. As the gap closed, the destroyer launched a torpedo, which the Kaiser Wilhelm narrowly avoided by executing a sharp turn to port. The maneuver was so sudden and forceful that it caused the liner to list slightly, but she quickly righted herself and continued her escape, leaving the frustrated destroyer to fall behind in her wake. The Kronprinz Wilhelm, heading north, encountered a different challenge. A light cruiser had spotted her and was rapidly closing in. The cruiser opened fire, and the first shells splashed ominously close to the Kronprinz Wilhelm. In response, the captain ordered an increase to full speed and began a series of evasive maneuvers. The ship zigzagged through the water, making it difficult for the cruiser to secure a direct hit.	1906	1943.0175
"However, I bore it uncomplainingly and rejuvenated my toilettes, although my friends grumbled at the frivolity of my new summer hat, ignorant of how well its counterpart would become Florence Isabel. It was to this hat that I attributed the final subjection of the baker's boy, a stolid youth, whom I had long looked upon as an unimportant link connecting the baking of the loaf with its appearance on my breakfast table. When, however, he took to calling for orders five times a day, one was forced to accept him as a human entity. "" 'Is memory's very short, 'e says, pore feller, "" so explained Florence Isabel, while I mused on the similarity in possibilities between an area step and a ballroom stair. However, the baker's boy went away, and I once more breathed freely."	"The summer wore on, and with it, my hat began to lose the charm that had once so captivated the bakery's envoy. No longer did he linger at the gate, nor did he muse wistfully upon the doorstep, cataloging imaginary orders. I contemplated this change with a mix of relief and inexplicable disappointment, wondering if perhaps the allure of my millinery had been the sole basis for his attentions. Florence Isabel, ever the pragmatist, simply adjusted her apron and remarked, ""Maybe 'e's found himself a new fancy, or a hat he likes better."" This casual dismissal of what had become a daily intrigue in my domestic life was both grounding and slightly vexing. As autumn approached, the leaves began their fiery transformation, and I found myself considering a change in my wardrobe to reflect the season. Perhaps a new hat, I mused, might not only lift my spirits but also rekindle the interest of our erstwhile frequent visitor. Yet, as I pondered this, I realized the folly in dressing for the baker’s boy—or for anyone"	1911	1932.5753
Tunnelling would be easy on Mars. Professor Lowell spoke of these matters in well weighed and well chosen phrases, which carried conviction of his earnestness and sincerity to the minds of his hearers ; and we observed that the audience was evidently profoundly impressed by the importance of his statements. This fact seemed to us very significant, as he was addressing one of the most brilliant assemblies — representing many branches of science — ever gathered within the walls of the Royal Institution. The numerous photographs showing the Martian canal lines were projected on to the screen by a lantern, and thus their convincing evidence was clearly brought before the whole of that vast audience.	The images, stark against the dark backdrop, depicted what appeared to be an intricate network of linear formations crisscrossing the Martian landscape. Professor Lowell explained that these were not merely geological anomalies but rather, he proposed, the result of intelligent effort—canals constructed by some form of Martian civilization to distribute water from the polar ice caps across the arid planet. His theory suggested a level of engineering sophistication and a desperate ingenuity aimed at surviving on a drying world.  As he continued, he delved into the potential mechanics of Martian tunnelling, explaining how the lower gravity of Mars, about 38% of Earth’s, would significantly reduce the force needed for excavation. He hypothesized that the soil composition, based on spectroscopic analysis, likely contained regolith which could be easily processed and used in constructing stable tunnel walls. This perspective opened a lively debate among the audience. Some scholars were skeptical, questioning the interpretation of the photographic evidence, while others contemplated the possibility of such an advanced Martian society. Discussions sprang up regarding the implications for astrobiology and planetary geology, further fueled	1911	2006.061
The exact contrary is. as far as my own experience and that of many large users go, the case, and as this aspect of the question is of the greatest importance, not only to railway companies, but also to all large users of light, I trust that Mr. Harrison will enlighten us as to the figures upon which his assumption is based. What, for instance, has he taken as the average consumption of the tungsten lamps in watts per M.Horizontal C. p. ? What is the economical limit to which such lamps should be used ? and what is the average economical life (ie., the hours of burning during which the consumption does not exceed the predetermined limit, say 1-5 watts per M.H.C. p.) obtained?	Furthermore, it is crucial to understand the comparative cost analysis between tungsten lamps and other types of lighting such as carbon filament or LED bulbs. Mr. Harrison's assertion seems to overlook the advancements in bulb technology that potentially offer greater efficiency and longer life spans, which could significantly alter the cost-effectiveness landscape. Moreover, it would be beneficial if Mr. Harrison could provide data regarding the depreciation rate of these tungsten lamps and their performance under various environmental conditions, as these factors play a pivotal role in determining their overall economic viability. The impact of frequent switching on and off, which is common in railway usage, on the life expectancy of these lamps should also be addressed. In addition to the technical and economical parameters, it would be advantageous to include a comparison of the light quality produced by these different lamps. Factors such as color temperature, color rendering index, and luminous efficacy could greatly influence user preference and suitability for specific applications, further affecting their practicality for large scale use. These details are essential for a comprehensive understanding and a fair evaluation of the viability of tungsten lamps in comparison to other available lighting	1912	2005.5676

It must not be assumed that the provision of sufficient light is all that is needed. It is equally essential that the light should be wisely used.	The proper distribution and intensity of lighting can greatly affect the efficiency and comfort of those exposed to it. Too often, the emphasis is placed merely on the quantity of light, while its quality and the manner in which it is employed are overlooked. Attention must also be given to the avoidance of glare, the minimization of shadows, and the color of the light, all of which play significant roles in the overall effectiveness of illumination. Moreover, the psychological effects of lighting should not be underestimated. The right lighting can enhance mood and increase productivity, while poor lighting can lead to discomfort and decreased efficiency. It is therefore incumbent upon those responsible for industrial, educational, and residential lighting systems to ensure that their installations are not only adequate but are also optimized for the best possible outcomes. Continued research and development in this field are crucial. Innovations in lighting technology, such as the advent of LED lighting, have already made significant impacts. These advancements not only offer greater energy efficiency but also provide opportunities for improved control over lighting environments. As we advance, the integration of smart lighting systems, capable of adjusting to natural light	1912	1948.7078

"""Boss,"" he said, his voice trembling with a mixture of amusement and disbelief, ""dem two gentlemen done got themselves tangled up in the bell rope somehow in they sleep. Every time one of 'em turns over, that bell starts a-ringing like Judgment Day!"" The proprietor couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation, even as he hurried over to the old church to untangle the unwitting guests from their noisy predicament. The next morning, over a hearty breakfast at the hotel, the tale of the midnight bell-ringing was recounted with much laughter and jest. The two traveling men, slightly embarrassed but in good spirits, vowed to always check the proximity of bell ropes in any future makeshift sleeping arrangements. The incident quickly became a favorite local story, illustrating the unexpected adventures that could happen in their small town."	1913	1925.4708
"""Long ago!"" What fortune the old man had and prized — fortune above the wasted wealth of dead men — was the breath of life in his withered body. He was alive — alive! A dust storm came down — a cloud of driving hot sand from the encircling dry waste. It darkened the day, it swept the diggings and choked the shanties, it enveloped the Golden Mile in a mist more terrible than the smoke of its prosperity, it ran swishing through the streets of the town. It blew like a black blizzard."	Men bent their heads and shielded their eyes as they walked, or stood with coats pulled up over their mouths to keep from breathing the gritty air. The old man, however, seemed impervious to the storm. His eyes, bright and unblinking, stared out from under his wide-brimmed hat, his thin lips set in a grim line. He moved through the swirling sand with an eerie steadiness, as if anchored to some unseen rock. Inside the dimly lit saloons, the noise of the storm was muffled. Glasses clinked, voices raised in a futile attempt to drown out the howling wind outside. But the old man did not seek refuge indoors. He had lived through worse, seen storms that could strip the flesh from bones, and had walked out of them with his spirit unbroken. As he trudged on, the storm seemed to recognize its old adversary. Gradually, the winds lessened their fury, the sand fell to the ground, settling like a blanket over the town. The sun peeked through the dispersing cloud, casting	1913	1959.0403

Winds are seldom less than 50 during gusts as the front passes, and rather frequently reach 75 miles per hour. A very intense line squall carries with it gusts up to 100 miles per hour. Because the cloud base is low and the vertical currents many and of high velocity, lightning discharge from line squall thunderstorms is vivid and frequent. The chances of a surface object such as a building or a boat being struck are greater when under a line squall thunderstorm than for any other type. Hail invariably is present in the thunderstorms and reaches the surface intermittently. Problems pertaining to aircraft operation near or through a line squall are more difficult than those at the surface. In addition to gusty surface winds, lightning strike and hail, the air in a line squall is very turbulent.	This turbulence can cause severe updrafts and downdrafts that challenge even the most seasoned pilots. The rapid changes in wind speed and direction can disorient the aircraft's navigation systems and make maintaining control a formidable task. Moreover, the dense cloud cover associated with line squalls reduces visibility dramatically, further complicating navigation and increasing the risk of mid-air collisions or ground strikes during landing or takeoff. Pilots are advised to avoid flying through line squalls if possible. If encounter with a line squall is inevitable, they are encouraged to ensure all onboard instruments are functioning correctly, to secure loose items that could become hazardous, and to inform passengers of potential turbulence. It is crucial for pilots to maintain communication with air traffic control for updates on the squall's movement and intensity, as well as for receiving guidance on the safest routes or altitudes to navigate during the event. Aircraft design and technology have advanced to mitigate some risks associated with flying in challenging weather conditions like line squalls. Features such as enhanced weather radar systems, reinforced airframes, and advanced autopilot systems help pilots manage	1913	2003.0673
"But what of wealth as a desired haven ? When we attempt to consider this subject we have especial need to follow Dr. Samuel Johnson's blunt advice and ""clear our minds of cant."" There is a great deal of foolish railing against wealth, which takes for [26]  granted, now that it is an unsubstantial and illusory good, and now that it is not a good at all, but only an unmixed evil, and the root of all other evils. Many preachers and moralists talk about wealth in this way, but they do not really think about it in this way. They know better. And when young people discover and observe the curious inconsistency between the teacher's words and his thoughts, as illuminated by his conduct, they are likely to experience a sense of disappointment, and a serious revulsion from doctrine which does not seem to be sincere. Wealth is simply the visible result of human labour, or of the utilisation of natural forces and products, in such a form that it can be exchanged."	It is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and therein lies its proper value and its potential danger. Wealth can provide comfort, security, and opportunities for education and cultural pursuits which might otherwise be inaccessible. It can enable charitable and philanthropic ventures that alleviate suffering and promote the general welfare. However, wealth becomes a peril when it is pursued as the ultimate goal, when it dictates one's values and controls one's actions to the exclusion of ethical considerations. The true measure of wealth is not in the accumulation but in its application. The wise use of wealth requires a balanced perspective and a clear understanding of its role as a tool rather than a trophy. This perspective allows individuals to seek wealth not for its own sake, but as a means to achieve a more fulfilling, productive, and beneficial life both for themselves and for others. Therefore, when we discuss wealth, let us not fall into the trap of vilifying it nor of idolizing it. Instead, let us consider how it might be used to improve the human condition, and remember that the ultimate worth of a person lies not	1908	1985.1317
"Then the War Department went in for affidavits and statements of men who claimed to have seen and known Con Garvin. Mrs. Garvin on her own account made a collection, too. Brought together, these certificates are so many sticks that have but vigorously stirred an already muddied pool — save in one particular: by their aid a sight, at one point, is to be had of the bottom, and at that point lies Company I, of the fifty second. Six privates certified to Mrs. Garvin that ""we have seen Cornelius Garvin, known him, and could identify him. And we hereby state to the best of our opinion that he is in the fifty second Regiment, New York Volunteers, at present"" [February 14, 1864], Whereupon one Samuel White, evidently to discredit the signers of that statement, certified that these men had been transferred to another regiment in September, 1863, and had left him and Cornelius Garvin with the Fifty second; but that he, Samuel White, had not seen Garvin since leaving Mitchells Station. Concerning Samuel White's testimony the War Department's memorandum reads: "" The certificate ... is false and evidently is intended to deceive, without being a forgery."	The intricacies of this case only deepened with each new affidavit. The War Department, increasingly frustrated by the conflicting accounts, decided to conduct a more thorough investigation into the whereabouts of Cornelius Garvin. Agents were dispatched to interview other members of the Fifty-second Regiment and to visit the locations mentioned in the various statements. As the investigation unfolded, more discrepancies emerged. Several of the affidavits contradicted each other not only in terms of dates and locations but also regarding the physical description of Cornelius Garvin himself. Some described him as tall and lean, others as short and stocky. This led to suspicions that perhaps multiple individuals were being mistaken for Garvin, or worse, that someone was intentionally impersonating him for reasons yet unknown. In a further twist, a letter was uncovered in the archives of the regiment, written by a Cornelius Garvin, dated after the last sighting claimed by Samuel White. In it, Garvin mentioned being reassigned to a field hospital due to injuries, which could explain his absence from the regiment. However, the signature on the letter slightly differed from that	1913	1982.5842
In the case of architects putting in bids for the construction of buildings or of engineers for the construction of bridges or other Works, and furnishing plans and specifications therefore, unless the parties calling'for bids expressly agree to pay for such plans and estimates, there can be no contract implied, for there is nothing in the circumstances that shows that pay was expected to be received or given, except through the possible beneﬁt to the parties performing the service in acceptance of their bids.’ ‘Topping v. Swords, 1 E. D. Smith, (509 [1852]; see also Reusch v. Amer. Brewing CO. (La. ), 11 S0. Rep. 719. 2Leskie 1: . Haseltine (Pa. Sup. ), 25 Atl. Rep. 886; Slate 0.

In these instances, the principle that emerges is that the submission of a bid, complete with plans and specifications, does not of itself imply a right to compensation unless such an arrangement is explicitly outlined in the initial request for proposals. This legal stance underscores the necessity for clarity and mutual understanding in contractual agreements, particularly in fields such as construction and engineering where the preparation of bids involves substantial effort and expense. Furthermore, the cases cited serve to illustrate the various interpretations and applications of this principle across different jurisdictions. For instance, in Topping v. Swords, the court held that without a clear agreement to pay for the preparation of plans, no payment could be demanded. Similarly, in McNeil v. Boston Chamber of Commerce, it was determined that the mere act of submitting a bid did not constitute an enforceable promise for payment unless explicitly stated. These precedents highlight the importance for professionals in these sectors to seek explicit confirmation of terms regarding compensation for bid preparation to avoid potential legal disputes. It is advisable for parties on both sides of the bidding process to negotiate and document all terms of engagement clearly before any work comm	1913	1998.0524
"Second, his much insisted on idea that if one coloration is a concealer, a different one on an animal of the same general habits isn't. He might just as well apply this objection to the mixed herds of diverse shaped African game, of which so many species have closely resemblant habits, saying, for instance: ""If the zebra is built right for this life, then it is a physical impossibility that the oryx is."" Or to the innumerable forest plants, each with its own shape, but with, to the casual eye, identical circumstances. Or, concerning such a company of birds as feed together on the marshes, he should say: ""These curlews, plover, and sandpipers live together and eat the same things; but if the curlew's bill is the right shape for his life, the very differently shaped bills of the other species are accidents and not adaptations."" This is an old, obsolete method in natural history, henceforth to be succeeded by pure experimentalism."	The experimental approach seeks to discern the functions and effectiveness of these adaptations through rigorous testing and observation, rather than mere speculation or casual observation. It is through such scientific rigor that we might understand why different species, though sharing similar habitats and lifestyles, exhibit varying physical traits. These differences, far from being mere accidents, are often evolutionary strategies finely tuned for survival and reproduction within their specific ecological niches.  Thus, the coloration of one animal serving as camouflage in a particular environment does not preclude a different coloration or pattern serving a similar purpose in another species, even within the same environment. Each adaptation must be understood in its own evolutionary and ecological context. This shift towards experimentalism in natural history encourages a more nuanced appreciation of the complexity of nature and the myriad ways in which life adapts to its environment. It moves us away from sweeping generalizations based on superficial similarities and towards a deeper, more precise understanding of the diversity of life on Earth.	1911	2005.5729
But my dear good Friend, why will you talk of keeping an Account ? Plays cost me Nothing, and, were they Ever so dear, You would overpay Me by the honour and pleasure I should receive in your Acceptance of such trifles. No, no, my proud, generous, high-spirited Lady, we will keep no Accounts but in our hearts, and if you don't balance the debt of Love and friendship you owe Me, I will use you, as such an ungrateful Devil ought to be TJs'd — so no more of that. I will not despair of seeing You some time or another at my sweet little Villa of 1 Boaden, vol.	Hampton; where the laurels and myrtles will remind you of our past conversations on the muses and the arts. The doors shall always stand open to welcome such an esteemed guest, and the gardens shall bloom the brighter for your presence. We can walk by the river and discuss poetry and life as we used to, in those golden days which are now but sweet memories. Do remember, my dear Friend, that each visit adds a leaf to the garland of our friendship, and I trust many more such leaves are yet to be added. Let us then cast aside any talk of debt or obligation, and let our meetings be as they have always been—times of joy and mutual delight, unshadowed by any thoughts of recompense or return. So, until that happy day when you grace my humble abode once more, I remain, with the greatest affection and esteem, your devoted and faithful friend.	1912	1869.6547

Nothing tends so surely to destroy the ideals of the Golden Rule and the ethics of brotherhood taught by the Nazarene as the appeal to the imagination of the people by military pageantry which suggests the glamour and old time ideas of the glory of war. The geographic position of the Republic, no less than her great charter of freedom, the Declaration of Independence, and the ideals of the fathers, makes this government the logical leader in the great civilization upward step that shall make war impossible; and the fact that the Christian church everywhere is silent or indifferent to the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount in this great crisis indicates how weak is the hold of the Nazarene and how strong is the influence of the Caesar spirit on the professed followers of Christ today.	The contradiction between the teachings of peace and the spectacle of martial display cannot be more stark. As we witness parades of soldiers, the rattle of sabers, and the march of infantry through our streets, it becomes increasingly difficult to reconcile these images with the principles of compassion and universal love espoused in sacred texts. The dichotomy is not merely troubling—it is a profound moral crisis that calls into question the very foundations of our societal values. Indeed, the allure of military grandeur not only captivates the imagination but also distorts our collective sense of honor and virtue. It fosters a culture where might is equated with right, where the ability to wage war is mistaken for true strength. This is a far cry from the teachings that urge us to turn the other cheek, to love our enemies, and to seek peace above all else. It is imperative, therefore, that those who lead—whether in government, in the church, or in our communities—reaffirm the principles of peace and brotherhood. They must actively work to dismantle the structures that glorify and perpetuate	1911	1987.3928
In the case of electric lamps it is easily accomplished without loss by running three wires instead of two. In the case of either illuminant it is not economical to turn out intermediate light sources, as the reduction of illumination is then out of all proportion to the reduction in cost. When dealing with railway station lighting the illuminating engineer will find that the ordinary lay man — by which I mean the man not versed in illuminating problems — will nearly always show a preference for lamps having opalescent globes well filled with fight.	Such globes diffuse the light more evenly, reducing harsh shadows and creating a softer ambiance that is generally perceived as more pleasant and less straining to the eyes. This preference is not merely aesthetic but also practical, as it enhances visibility and reduces the likelihood of accidents, which is a critical consideration in the bustling environment of a railway station. Furthermore, the layout of the lighting must be strategically planned to ensure that all areas are well-lit, particularly the platforms, ticketing areas, and pathways. The challenge is to achieve optimal illumination while managing energy consumption effectively. To this end, the use of LED technology has been increasingly favored in modern setups due to its superior energy efficiency and longer lifespan compared to traditional incandescent or fluorescent lighting solutions. Additionally, integrating motion sensors can further enhance energy efficiency by ensuring lights are only on when needed. Such innovations not only contribute to cost savings but also align with broader environmental sustainability goals. The role of the illuminating engineer, therefore, extends beyond mere installation to encompass a thoughtful consideration of both human and ecological impacts, ensuring that lighting solutions are both effective and responsible.	1912	2005.1619
"These are living relations, having the warmth of life — of enmity, perhaps, as well as of amity. Impressions of animate and inanimate things and of the whole scene in Hs passing variations sink quietly but deeply into the child's sensibility, the field of which is broadened as well as deepened by cherished associations. A cult is formed, what Wordsworth called a ""natural piety."" Thomas Hardy, in The Return of the Native, has portrayed the kind of sensibility developed to maturity in this natural Betting. These traits of individual or community would differ with every particular environment; they could not be mentally conceived or invented; they belong to the creative field, and so allure the creative novelist."	"Hardy’s characters are thus deeply rooted in their native soil, their actions and destinies intertwined with the heathland that both sustains and confines them. This profound connection to place shapes their identities and fates, with the landscape acting almost as a character in its own right. The heath, with its undulating hills, its brooding presence, and its capricious weather patterns, reflects and influences the emotional and psychological states of the characters. It is this intrinsic bond with the environment that Hardy captures so vividly, demonstrating how the external world is not merely a backdrop but a vital component in the narrative structure. In a similar vein, Wordsworth’s concept of ""natural piety"" suggests a reverence for nature that goes beyond the aesthetic, imbuing it with a spiritual and moral dimension. This reverence is cultivated through a continuous interaction with nature, which in turn enriches the human experience, providing both solace and inspiration. The natural world, in Wordsworth’s view, is not only a source of beauty but also a wise teacher, offering lessons on humility, perseverance, and"	1913	2005.9962
"He told the men so. They struck. The Powers then closed in on Johnson, hitting him publicly and privately in every way a man could be struck. They assailed his credit, with cold cynicism notifying him that they would ""break"" him financially. He smiled and gave his answer in one word: ""Break!"" And at last they did break him. They went further. They spared not even his good name. They resorted to every thinkable device to crush him. Yet still he bore up. The strain was terrible, however. Iron that he was, it began to show on him. His great figure began to shrink. A man came out of a doorway as the mayor was about to enter his motor car and said: ""Hold a moment."	"I have something to say to you."" Johnson, weary yet resolute, paused and turned to the stranger. ""Yes, what is it?"" he asked, his voice steady despite the fatigue that lined his face. The man hesitated, glancing around nervously before leaning closer. ""They're planning something worse, something personal. I thought you should know,"" he whispered, urgency coloring his tone. Johnson's eyes narrowed, a flicker of concern passing through them before he masked it with a nod of acknowledgment. ""Thank you for the warning,"" he said quietly, his mind racing with the implications of this new threat. As the man disappeared back into the shadows of the doorway, Johnson stepped into his car, his resolve hardening.  No matter the attacks, the personal vendettas, he knew his cause was just, and he would not be deterred. He directed his driver to head home, all the while planning his next move. The battle was far from over, and Johnson was ready to fight it on all fronts. His adversaries had underestimated his resilience and his commitment to"	1911	1997.8153

The straining action may thus be specified by the normal thrust, the shearing force, and the bending moment, or simply by the linear arch, and when the straining actions are known, the stress intensities in the rib can be calculated. As in straight beams, the shearing force may often be neglected as   347 producing little effect on the stresses. The bending stresses might be calculated as in Art. 129 if the curvature of the rib is great, but usually it is sufficient to calculate them as for a straight beam, as in Art. 63. The uniform compression arising from the thrust P is added algebraically to the bending stress, as in Arts. 97 and 98, and the radial and circumferential shearing stress arising from the shearing force may be calculated as in Art. 71, and, if necessary, combined with the bending and other direct stress to find the principal stresses, as in Arts.	99 and 100. In cases where the rib forms a part of a larger structure, such as an arch in a bridge, it is essential to consider the additional effects of temperature changes, settlements, or dynamic loads such as those caused by traffic, which may introduce secondary stresses that are not immediately apparent. These factors can significantly affect the overall stress distribution and should be taken into account to ensure the safety and durability of the structure. Furthermore, the influence of the supports and their conditions—whether they are fixed, pinned, or sliding—must be assessed, as they directly impact the distribution of moments and forces within the rib. Art. 102 provides a method for analyzing the effect of different support conditions on the internal forces. For more complex geometries or loading conditions, numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA) might be necessary to obtain a more accurate understanding of the stress states. This approach allows for a more detailed visualization of stress concentrations which might not be evident from simpler analytical methods. Finally, it is crucial to verify all calculated stresses against the material strength properties to ensure that they do	1908	2005.0831
"I would suggest, however, that Adnil's indirect lighting fitting would be better without the upper reflector, as "" sanding "" will not prevent a concentrated reflection of the lamps below.

My adverse remarks upon some of the  212 points in his paper arc directed, not in any way against the use of ga, but the mode of handling it. MR. N. W.

The spirit of cooperation and mutual respect that characterized our interactions is a testament to the professionalism we both strive to uphold in our work and in our contributions to the field. Regarding the points of contention raised during the discussion, it is crucial to remember that the field of lighting, particularly in commercial settings such as shop fronts, is one that benefits greatly from diverse perspectives and innovative approaches. It is this variety that drives our industry forward, allowing us to refine and perfect our methods. To address the specific concerns about the use of indirect lighting and the suggestion to eliminate the upper reflector, I appreciate the observation and the rationale behind it. The intention behind the design was indeed to mitigate any harsh reflections and create a more diffused, ambient lighting environment which enhances the aesthetic appeal of the storefront while maintaining functional visibility. However, the point about potential over-concentration of light is well taken and is something that will be considered in future designs. Further, while I advocate for the use of advanced lighting technologies, including gas where appropriate, it is critical to apply these solutions thoughtfully.

We went down a steep road between clay banks, and it seemed as if we were descending into the bowels of the earth. There was not the gleam of a blade of grass about, and high above us blazed the tyrant of the desert in unapproachable magnificence. But we were quickly delivered from this ugly stretch of what is really the ancient shore of the Dead Sea, and at a turn found ourselves in the running oasis of the river banks, a little paradise of green fields and hedges of oleander and tamarisk. We crossed one field and passed into another, there to be met by a crowd of half dressed people who had come down before us. Here all the bushes were hung with drying linen; there were great piles of clothes on the grass; in one corner was a tent church, and in another a Turkish araka shop.	The air was filled with the scent of freshly washed garments and the murmuring sounds of the river mingled with the laughter and chatter of the villagers. Children played near the water's edge, splashing and shouting in delight, while their mothers scrubbed and wrung out clothing, spreading it out to dry under the fierce sun. Men lounged in the shade of the tamarisks, smoking pipes and discussing the day's events or the prices in the market. The scene was a vibrant tapestry of daily life, a stark contrast to the barrenness we had just traversed. As we moved further into the heart of the oasis, the vegetation grew even denser. Date palms towered above, their fronds rustling in the slight breeze, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The river, a life-giving artery, wound its way through the landscape, its banks lush with reeds and wildflowers. Here and there, small wooden bridges crossed the water, connecting the different parts of the community. The tent church was a simple structure, its fabric walls flapping gently in	1913	1989.743
. . . If Shakespeare had not been loftier, more prolific, in a word more of a poet than all the feeble founders of our dramatic literature, the English might be blamed for continuing in their blindness. But what a prodigious difference! I leave it to those who have read Shakespeare or seen him acted and who understand him. . .	For those who have not, let them consider the depths of human nature that he plumbs, the broad sweep of his characters, each so vividly alive, each speaking a language so peculiarly their own. His plays are not merely plays, but universes teeming with life, with the secret whispers of the human heart, with the laughter and tears of existence. Each line, each word even, carries weight, bursting with meaning and emotion. His tragedies delve into the darkest recesses of human despair and ambition, while his comedies play lightly upon the strings of love and folly, yet always with a profound respect for the complexities of life. Shakespeare, in his boundless imagination and insight, seems to transcend time and place. He captures the essence of what it means to be human, crafting stories that resonate as deeply today as they did in his own time. His works challenge the mind, stir the heart, and awaken the soul. How can one not be moved by the tragic plight of Hamlet, the searing passion of Romeo and Juliet, or the cunning machinations of I	1912	1902.5646
The elections were no less in regard to other offices. In Muskantine, Iowa, three seats on the school board were filled by Socialists; in Two Harbours, Michigan, the mayor, city assessor, justice of the peace, and three aldermen were elected. In spite of these facts, it is almost surprising that Bennington, Vermont, elected E. D. Barber corporation attorney against Judge G. L. Bates. Socialists of Belle Plain, Iowa, elected one alderman and failed to fill the offices of mayor and another alderman by a very narrow vote. Two of the largest increases in the spring elections were those in St. Louis, Missouri, and Fort Worth, Texas. Socialist candidates won in neither of these places, but in Fort Worth the vote grew to 1,270 from 120 last November.	In St. Louis, the Socialist party saw their numbers swell from a mere 2,500 votes to well over 15,000, signaling a substantial growth in their support base, albeit not enough to secure any seats this time around. This growth is indicative of a broader shift in the political landscape, where more citizens are beginning to align with Socialist ideals, perhaps driven by the increased discussions around income inequality and workers' rights that have permeated national discourse. Elsewhere, in Reading, Pennsylvania, a Socialist was elected as the city auditor, and in Schenectady, New York, two Socialist candidates were victorious in securing roles as city council members. These successes underscore the varied successes the party is experiencing at a local level across different states, suggesting a patchwork of support that is not confined to any one region. The pattern observed in these elections suggests that while the Socialist party is making significant inroads in certain areas, the overall acceptance across broader regions remains a challenge. The party's strategy moving forward may need to focus on consolidating these gains while finding new ways to appeal to a wider	1911	2001.352
"We aim to be clear, but we do not wish the teacher ever to forget that we are discussing a difficult and complex question, and that it is not worth while to discuss it at all if our discourse becomes a monologue; the whole mind of the reader must be ready to respond in self activity. If the teachers did not forget that so easily they would not so often become the prey of pedagogical fads and fancies, advocated with empty arguments on one day and forgotten with indecent haste the next. We have no new fad to defend and no pet theory to offer. We have no patent medicine for all educational  4   blundering. We are not hustling with the "" yellow '' psychologists, nor do we worship at the bygone shrines of the "" Herbartians "" — we have no schemes at all for "" getting rich quick "" in educational wisdom."	Our aim is rather to provoke thoughtful consideration and to foster genuine insight into the process of education. This demands a careful, deliberate examination of principles, methods, and outcomes rooted in a deep understanding of human psychology and developmental needs. We believe in the steady cultivation of knowledge, the measured assessment of educational practices, and the thoughtful application of theory to practice. This approach may not be as flashy or immediately gratifying as the latest trends often promise, but it is built on a foundation of enduring values and proven principles that respect the complexity of teaching and learning. Education is not merely the transmission of facts or the enforcement of rigid methods; it is the art and science of facilitating meaningful learning experiences that promote growth and development. As such, it requires a commitment to continuous learning, reflection, and adaptation on the part of educators. It demands a respect for the individuality of each learner and an understanding of the diverse ways in which people learn and grow. This is the ethos we advocate—a reflective, principled approach to education that values depth over superficiality, understanding over rote memorization, and long-term growth	1909	1990.131
"Frequently buried with the corpse was a cross which, according to the same authority, was ""generally of wood, with a sheathing of gilt metal."" King Edward the Confessor was buried with a golden crucifix  I have met but one instance of the so-called 'cross of absolution; ' this was found in the tomb of Saint Birinus.4 3. Boundary. In the crosses of the graveyard, we noted four small crosses marking the limits of the ground. These were ' boundary crosses.' There are references in the terms contained in charters to various boundary crosses, in which they are referred to as a ' gilded cross, ' a ' wooden cross, ' a ' stone cross, ' a ' red cross, ' and sometimes merely a ' Christ symbol.' * These served to mark the limits of church property. So the monks of Edmundsbury' erected four crosses, one at each extremity of the town, to define the limits of their authority, and Bishop Losinga' raised a cross at Norwich to serve as a boundary mark between the land of the church and the borough. St. Guthlac also set up a cross at Croyland as a boundary mark. There is an Irish canon of the eighth century which directs that a cross should be set up on all consecrated grounds, not only to mark the bounds, but also to sanctify the spot. A few centuries later, in England, a law had to be passed forbidding men to set up a cross falsely upon their lands in order to pass them off as church property, and so evade taxation To these boundary stones of the church land, the soi. 312."	disant 'crosses' added a layer of sacred legitimacy. This blending of the spiritual and the terrestrial in such symbols served both practical and divine purposes, transforming simple boundary markers into potent icons of religious authority and protection. This practice was not limited to England. Across medieval Europe, boundary crosses were common, each serving as a testament to the church’s reach and influence over both land and people.  In some cases, these crosses became pilgrimage sites themselves, drawing believers who would come and pray for blessings or absolution. The crosses thus acted not only as physical demarcations but also as focal points of communal and spiritual life. As time passed, many of these crosses, originally erected as mere boundary markers, accrued legends and became imbued with deeper, more mystical significances.  Local folklore often sprang up around these crosses, telling tales of miracles or divine interventions associated with the site. Such stories served to further elevate the spiritual status of these markers, embedding them more deeply into the cultural and spiritual landscape of the area.  Despite their sacred status, boundary crosses were not immune to the rav	1904	2002.1953
After a woman had had her first child she might eat certain other ribs, after her second child still others, and only after having five children might she eat all the ribs; but even then she must not eat the membranes on the inside of the ribs. If her child was sick she must not eat certain ribs, and if two of her children were sick she might not eat certain other ribs. If her brother's child was sick, she might not eat certain portions, and if her brother's wife died there were still different prohibitions. The taboos applying to the ribs of the sheep had relation to the health of her children and of her relatives.	These dietary restrictions were deeply ingrained within the fabric of her tribe's culture, serving not only as a guide for personal conduct but also as a means of maintaining the spiritual and physical harmony of the community. Such practices were believed to influence the welfare of individuals and their families, linking the consumption of specific foods to the broader cosmic order. In the event of a communal feast or celebration, the distribution of sheep ribs and other delicacies followed these strict customary laws. Elders and wise women of the tribe would oversee the preparation and allotment of food, ensuring that each member received their appropriate share according to age, status, and personal circumstances. This careful observation of dietary taboos was thought to appease spirits and ancestors, who, in turn, would look favorably upon the tribe, promoting health, fertility, and protection from harm. Violations of these food taboos were taken seriously and were often met with social reprimand or ritual cleansing processes. The collective belief was that any breach could lead to misfortune not only for the individual but for the entire community, manifesting in various	1913	1988.8871
The fur is long, soft and silky, and consists of an under fur of very fine hairs, and of much fewer longer and somewhat flattened hairs. The colour varies from a light almost silvery tint to a rich chestnut brown, with an iridescent effect in the live animal. The pouch varies in size according to the season. It opens backward, and may have an internal width of half an inch, with a depth of one third of an inch. There are two white mamma: , which are well marked in the breeding season. Spencer noted, and commented on, the indication of a rudiment of a pouch in some of the males which he obtained. Our knowledge of the Mole has been almost entirely obtained from Dr. Stirling and Professor Spencer.	Their extensive studies have provided a detailed understanding of its habitat preferences, dietary habits, and reproductive cycles. The mole, primarily a solitary creature, constructs intricate burrows and tunnels that serve both as living quarters and as traps for its prey, which consists mainly of insects and earthworms. Its powerful forelimbs are adapted for digging, with broad paws and robust claws, making it an efficient excavator. The mole's keen sense of touch compensates for its poor eyesight; its snout is equipped with highly sensitive tactile hairs that detect vibrations and movements in the soil. This tactile sensitivity is crucial for navigating underground and capturing prey. During the breeding season, which typically occurs in late winter to early spring, the behavior of the mole changes noticeably. Males become more active above ground as they search for mates, which can occasionally make them more visible to predators and humans. The gestation period for a mole is approximately four weeks, after which the female gives birth to a litter of three to five young. The juveniles are born blind and hairless, depending entirely on maternal care within the	1909	2002.4968
In the orange belt, land excellently suited for oranges and adjoining groves in successful bearing, but not now in cultivation, can be bought for about $200 an acre. In the immediate vicinity of Phoenix, of course, prices are higher, and near Mesa, where the country is largely cut up into comparatively small tracts and where many people are making an excellent living on ten and fifteen acres, land is held at about $200 an acre. In view of what these lands will produce, these prices are exceedingly moderate. The valley now is rapidly settling up, the small farm is becoming the unit, and, as the land is farmed in smaller tracts, it naturally produces more intensively under careful handling and, therefore, is bound to steadily increase in value. For the hardworking, energetic man of intelligence and common-sense the lands of the Salt River valley offer a return on his labour and intelligence which will soon put him in an independent position, and it is to this class of men that it particularly appeals.	The fertility of the soil, combined with the ample water supply provided by the Salt River Project, ensures that even a modest parcel can yield abundant crops. Citrus fruits, particularly oranges, as well as cotton, alfalfa, and vegetables, thrive in the valley's warm climate and rich soil. The investment in irrigation has transformed what was once arid desert land into some of the most productive agricultural land in the Southwest. Moreover, the community infrastructure around Phoenix and Mesa supports the agricultural lifestyle with markets, agricultural cooperatives, and extension services that provide education on best farming practices and innovations in crop management. This communal and institutional support further enhances the appeal of the region for those looking to establish a new farm or expand their agricultural ventures. As the population of the area continues to grow, driven by the pleasant climate and economic opportunities, demand for locally grown produce is likely to increase. This provides an additional market advantage to the local farmers. Furthermore, the beauty of the landscape, with its sweeping vistas and the backdrop of rugged mountains, adds a quality of life that is hard to quantify but easy to appreciate. 	1911	2005.1378
How far could we carry a treatise on government without law, or on law without reference to religion and ethics, and what mountains of specialism we must raise between our eyes and the facts before we could fail to see the interaction of any one of these with the contemporary state of science and philosophy, of literature and art. We may carry specialism further in one field than in another according as the facts are more or less closely knit but whenever we take one side of social life, be it the economic, the religious, or any other, and treat it as though it stood alone we are on the road to fallacy. It is not the function of a sociological journal to produce a ready made scheme of Sociology.	Rather, its role is to explore and elucidate the intricate and often intertwined relationships that form the fabric of society. By examining the multifaceted connections between law, religion, ethics, science, philosophy, literature, and art, a sociological journal fosters a comprehensive understanding of the social world. It encourages scholars and readers alike to consider the dynamic interplay of these elements and how they shape human behavior and societal structures. In this pursuit, it is essential to resist the temptation to isolate one social aspect from others, as doing so can lead to a narrow and potentially misleading perspective. Each component of society influences and is influenced by the others, creating a complex system of mutual interdependence. For instance, legal systems are often deeply intertwined with ethical values and religious beliefs, which in turn are influenced by philosophical thought and scientific understanding. Similarly, literature and art not only reflect but also shape the cultural and social contexts in which they are created. Thus, a sociological journal serves as a platform for critical dialogue and interdisciplinary research, aiming to bridge the gaps between various fields of study. It challenges the boundaries	1908	2007.3839

OPERATING PROBLEMS. — Operation of seacraft well out at sea in a thick tog is not hazardous as long as there is no danger of collision with other ships or icebergs. The real danger of fog lies in following a course near reefs, rocks, sand bars, near shore, into inlets and bays or in the presence of numerous other ships or icebergs when the visibility is restricted too much to alter a course in time to avoid an accident. If there is the slightest possibility of collision due to poor visibility, the vessel should proceed with reduced speed. Navigation in a fog must be by radio or dead reckoning which, if used together, are sufficiently accurate. Aircraft, being free to fly above advection fogs in clear and warmer air, are not restricted in operation unless terminal ports are also obscured. Celestial, radio and dead reckoning navigation are available to the captain.	In such situations, the use of foghorns and other auditory signals becomes crucial. These are designed to alert nearby vessels of one's presence, thereby reducing the risk of collision. Vessels are also equipped with radar systems that can detect objects in the vicinity, even in poor visibility conditions. The radar works by emitting radio waves that reflect off objects and return to the receiver, providing the captain with information on the location and movement of nearby ships or obstacles. Moreover, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) dictate specific rules for navigating in foggy conditions. These include maintaining a safe speed, using fog signals, and having a proper lookout. The use of sound signals such as bells, gongs, or whistles is mandated to indicate a ship's position and actions to other seafarers, especially when visibility is severely compromised. For maritime pilots, the challenge is not only navigating safely but also communicating effectively with other ships and maritime traffic control to coordinate movements and avoid accidents. This involves a continuous exchange of information regarding positions, speeds, and intended maneuvers. 	1913	2003.7825
"However, I found Mr. Joseph Monin showing no ill effects from his night of toil, and indeed looking far healthier and happier than most corporation presidents are apt to after a night of labour, and from him I obtained the information I desired. The company was organised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1898, by thirty one union glass blowers. These men were natives of France and Belgium, and in their home countries had been more or less familiar with co operative industries. They were dissatisfied with their conditions; they saw that they were creating much wealth, but were getting little of it. They were tired of ""dividing up, "" and decided to establish a factory of their own. They had saved their wages until they were able to contribute $200 each."	This initial capital, amounting to $6,200, was sufficient to rent a small building and purchase the necessary equipment to start their glassblowing enterprise. They named their venture the Union Glass Company, a nod both to their origins as union workers and to their cooperative business model. Mr. Monin, who had joined the company a few years after its founding, explained that the early days were challenging but exhilarating. The group faced numerous obstacles, from learning the intricacies of business management to competing with established glass manufacturers. However, their skills as craftsmen were unmatched, and their commitment to fair labor practices and mutual support provided a strong foundation. The company adopted a democratic management style. Decisions were made collectively, profits were shared equitably, and workers had a say in the direction of the company. This approach not only fostered a strong sense of camaraderie among the workers but also attracted attention from social reformers and other industries interested in the co-operative model. Over the years, the Union Glass Company grew in both size and reputation. It became known for producing high-quality glass	1911	1996.1488
"Misapprehension upon this point has caused some eighteenth century authors to be quite undeservedly set down as evolutionists. had had before his mind so momentous a new idea as that of evolution, he should not have contrived to give a far plainer intimation of it than a single vague remark that imperceptible gradations are found not only in the forms but also in the generations and the successions of every species. At this time, at all events — whatever he may have been later — Buffon was fairly outspoken in the expression of even heterodox hypotheses; it was only subsequently that he was condemned by the Sorbonne, on account of opinions propounded in his ""Theorie de la Terre, "" contained in the same volume as the preliminary discourse. It is significant, moreover, that at this date he saw no hint of any J evolutionary significance in the homologies of the vertebrate skeleton; he had as yet learned nothing from comparative anatomy."	Instead, his attention was largely consumed by the peculiarities of geographical distribution and the adaptation of organisms to their environments, topics that he explored with much curiosity but without the overarching framework of evolutionary theory. Thus, while Buffon's observations were indeed prescient in recognizing the variability and diversity of nature, they did not constitute a coherent theory of evolution as later understood by Darwin and others. Buffon's reluctance to embrace a fully evolutionary perspective can perhaps be attributed to the scientific and philosophical milieu of his time, which favored a static view of nature ordained by divine creation. His speculative thoughts about the potential for species change were constrained by the prevailing natural theological context, which saw each species as perfectly adapted by a Creator to its role in a harmonious and unchanging order. This context made it difficult for early naturalists to conceive of nature as a dynamic system of change driven by natural processes. It was not until the nineteenth century, with the advent of more extensive fossil discoveries and a deeper understanding of heredity and variation, that a robust theory of evolution would be formulated. Thus, while Buffon and his	1911	2005.2793

Blake was a seminal case that set important precedents in contract law, particularly regarding the enforceability of verbal agreements and the requirement for consideration to be present for a contract to be valid. In this case, Carpenter, the plaintiff, had entered into a verbal agreement with Blake, the defendant, in which Blake promised to sell a piece of property. When Blake later refused to complete the sale, Carpenter sued for breach of contract. The court ultimately held that while verbal agreements are legally binding, they must be supported by consideration - something of value exchanged between the parties - in order to be enforceable. In this instance, the court found that Carpenter had provided sufficient consideration by relying on Blake's promise and taking steps in preparation for the purchase, thereby suffering a detriment. This case underscores the principle that not all agreements, especially verbal ones, automatically translate into enforceable contracts without the requisite elements, such as consideration, being met. It also highlights the judicial emphasis on the need for clear, unequivocal evidence of the terms of the agreement and the intent of the parties involved. Following Carpenter v.

There is no reason, for instance, why Bondwomen should not have votes. Voting powers for the mass mean nothing more than an instrument of protection, and Bondwomen in particular should be given this means of protection, their more robust sisters being relatively less in need of it. Thus, we hold the vote should, like the air and a pure water supply, be free to all. 999 Granting that votes should be thus widely distributed, and that it is necessary to put forward strong efforts to get them, we may go on to say that we do not regard the vote in itself as even a symbol of freedom, nor do we find it easy to understand those who do.	Votes are, indeed, but a small part of the machinery of government. They are a means, not an end. The true essence of freedom lies not in the mere act of voting, but in the power to influence one's own life and environment, which voting may, under the right conditions, help to secure. It is the conditions under which this influence is exercised, and the purposes to which it is put, that determine the real value of the vote. The suffrage, therefore, while important, is only one aspect of a much larger question of rights and responsibilities. It is but one tool in the arsenal of democracy, and its effectiveness depends largely on how it is used and what it is used for. The ultimate goal should be not merely to distribute votes, but to empower individuals and ensure that their voices lead to meaningful change and improvement in their lives and communities. Therefore, while we advocate for the extension of voting rights to Bondwomen and indeed to all disenfranchised groups, we must also work tirelessly to ensure that these rights are supported by broader social, economic, and political	1911	1894.8724
In a mine, however, the percentage of black damp nearly always rises with the percentage of fire damp, and the actual effect of the mixture on the flame cannot be predicted from the mere percentage of fire damp, although a moderate percentage of fire damp in the air will, other things being equal, always cause the lamp to give a better light than if the fire damp was absent.

THE following is a brief description of several of the miner's lamps awarded prizes in the recent Home Office Competition. These lamps were exhibited at the meeting of the Illuminating Engineering Society at the Royal Society of Arts on November 19th. We give some particulars, based on information supplied by the manufacturers. The first prize of £600 was awarded to the C.E.A.G. Lamp, entered by F. Farber, FIG.	1, which featured a robust design with an enhanced safety mechanism to prevent ignition of fire damp. The lamp's construction included a double gauze system that provided higher resistance to flame penetration, crucial in preventing the ignition of methane-rich environments commonly found in mines. The second prize of £400 went to the Hailwood & Ackroyd Ltd. Model H, FIG. 2. This lamp was praised for its innovative use of a magnetic lock system, which ensured that the lamp could only be opened with a specific tool provided by the manufacturer, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized or unsafe access to the flame. The third prize of £200 was awarded to the Protector Lamp & Lighting Co. for their Type 6 lamp, FIG. 3. This model incorporated a water gauge that allowed miners to monitor the humidity levels within the lamp, which is key to adjusting the flame intensity and ensuring optimal illumination under varying atmospheric conditions. Each of these lamps also featured improvements in light output and fuel efficiency, with the use of higher quality materials that extended the life of the wicks and reduced the overall maintenance	1912	1989.5333
Besides his opening address, Prof. Silvanus Thompson lectured on the Trend of Geometrical Optics, and, in conjunction with Prof. E. G. Coker, presented a paper on the construction of Large Polariscopes. Prof. Stirling gave a popular and fascinating demonstration of some optical illusions, and Prof. H. H. Turner lectured on ' The Great American Observatories.' The chief paper dealing with illumination and photometry was that by Messrs. J. S. Dow and V. H. Mac kinney. The authors laid stress on the value of convenient and simple  352 apparatus, and showed how the Holo phanc lumeter, in conjunction with the new apparatus for determining polar curves used therewith, greatly simplified the work of commercial photometry. Another piece of apparatus shown and described for the first time was the Holopliane portable standard of light. This consists essentially in a small tungsten lamp fed by an accumulator packed away in a convenient form of case.	The lumeter itself was praised for its ability to accurately measure light intensity from various sources, and the discussion that followed emphasized its potential impact on the industry. The Holophane portable standard of light, particularly, was noted for its practicality in field measurements, allowing photometrists to conduct accurate assessments on-site without the need for bulky equipment. Further discussions in the session included advances in the measurement of diffuse reflection and the role of color temperature in photometric evaluations. The importance of standardizing illumination conditions to ensure consistent and reliable measurements across different environments was another key topic. Prof. Thompson's lecture on the Trend of Geometrical Optics delved into the latest theoretical developments and their applications in designing more efficient optical systems. He highlighted the shift towards using complex geometrical constructions to better understand and manipulate light paths for improved optical performance. Meanwhile, Prof. Turner's talk on 'The Great American Observatories' provided insights into the technological advancements and research focus areas of leading observatories in the United States. He discussed the integration of new optical technologies, such as adaptive optics and digital imaging, which have	1912	2004.8253
"(Of course I only said that to make it sound funny.) "" I wrote to the Editor and explained to him that Dennis's picture ought to get the prize because if he would stop and think about it, this brood was the most pathetic one of all because it had ' never had no mother.' He wrote back that he had very much enjoyed both the picture and the letter and how old was Dennis, and he sent the five dollars himself because he said he was afraid the judges wouldn't have a sense of humour. He meant that he knew the picture only pretended to be pathetic, but they wouldn't. We have spent most of the money for candy and lunches because we sometimes become tired of eating bread and milk on the pantry shelf, and we have not told our parents about it because they would not be interested."	We have decided to save the remaining dollar for another adventure, perhaps even wilder than the first. Dennis thinks we should buy a small boat and sail to the island in the middle of the lake, while I am more inclined to invest in a new set of paints so we can enter more competitions. Regardless, we are sure to find some mischief with it. Our secret fund, hidden in an old tin box under the loose floorboard in my room, remains our little conspiracy against the mundane adult world which so often forgets the thrill of small joys and the taste of stolen sweets. It's a world of our own making, where every coin saved is a promise of future escapades and every whispered plan a bond that tightens our friendship.  And so, with pockets slightly heavier and hearts buoyed by mischief, we plot our next grand escapade under the watchful eyes of a world too busy to notice the dreams of two adventurous souls.	1913	1985.5504
The position of the resultant has been recorded both by giving the position of the point of intersection of the resultant with the chord, from the leading edge — expressed as a fraction of the chord — and by giving its moment about the leading edge of the aerofoil. Either of the above quantities taken in conjunction with the lift and drift is sufficient to define completely the position of the resultant. The reason for the inclusion of the moment about the leading edge is that the centre of pressure as above defined moves off to infinity when the resultant force is parallel to the chord, whilst the moment about the leading edge always remains finite. The results are given in Table 3, and are plotted in Figs. 6, 7 and 8. An explanation of the units in which moments are recorded is given in the introduction to the present report. Aerofoils RAF.	6A and 6B were tested under various angles of attack ranging from 0 to 15 degrees. The data collected provides critical insights into the aerodynamic behaviors of these aerofoils, specifically focusing on how changes in angle affect the lift and drag coefficients, as well as the center of pressure and its corresponding moment about the leading edge. For each angle of attack, both lift and drag forces were measured, and their resultant calculated. This resultant force’s point of intersection with the chord of the aerofoil gives an indication of the center of pressure, which is crucial for understanding the stability and control characteristics of an aircraft wing or similar structures. The movement of the center of pressure and the variation of the moment about the leading edge as the angle of attack is altered are of particular interest. These variations can significantly influence the pitching moment and thus the overall aerodynamic stability. Figures 6, 7, and 8 in the report illustrate these relationships graphically, showing the trajectory of the center of pressure across the range of angles tested. It is observed that as the angle of attack	1912	1989.6371
On occasion of the great exhibition with which France closed the nineteenth century, a number of Congresses assembled on the north bank of the Seine. At the initiative of these savants the Congress Hall was reserved during the first week of September for the meeting of the first Congress of the History of Religions. It was a memorable gathering, less notable, perhaps, for the actual papers that were read, than for the conceptions that animated it, and the striking personalities who took part in it. Some of these have already passed away. Albert R£ville, who filled the president's chair with so much dignity and grace, Auguste Sabatier, the philosophic theologian, L£on Marillier, the skilled interpreter of the lower culture, were among the chief promoters, and impressed on the Congress the breadth and sympathy of their own genius.	"Their discussions transcended mere academic debate, exploring the profound intersections of faith, culture, and history that define human spirituality across the globe. The hall, filled with the murmur of many languages, became a place where ideas flowed as freely as the waters of the Seine outside. Scholars from distant lands brought with them diverse perspectives, each enriching the tapestry of understanding that the Congress sought to weave. In the spirit of true ecumenism, the sessions were marked by a mutual respect for all creeds and practices. This was not a place for proselytizing, but for listening and learning. Theories were proposed, challenged, and refined in the crucible of collective intelligence. It was here that the concept of the ""global history of religions"" began to take a definitive shape, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all human religious experience. The papers presented ranged from analyses of ancient rites to considerations of contemporary religious dynamics. One particularly poignant presentation examined the role of ritual in maintaining community identity, while another explored the shifting landscapes of religious affiliation in the modern world.

Various Matters. 52. Endurance. — The warping test abovementioned belongs also to the present heading; in addition, experiments have been made on paints, varnishes, water resisting glues, and methods of construction likely to assist against damage by weather. 264 The loading to destruction of the type BE. 2 might also hare been reported under this head. Protracted tests in the weathering of fabrics are in progress, and reports have been asked for and received from the N.P.b. on germicides for protective purposes. non actinic colouring matters are also being tried. A new design is complete in which the use of glue during construction is entirely avoided. As a precaution against flawed material in wire fixings all such attachments are now made of laminated steel welded at the edges, each lamination having the full margin of strength. 53.	Efficiency of New Alloys. — In connection with the quest for materials that offer greater resistance to corrosion and enhanced durability, several new alloys have been introduced and are currently under examination. Notably, an alloy comprising nickel, chromium, and molybdenum has shown promising results in preliminary tests for resistance to both thermal and oxidative stress. This material, tentatively named Alloy X, is being considered for use in high-temperature environments where conventional materials tend to fail. 54. Improvement in Aerodynamic Designs. — Recent advancements in aerodynamic theory have led to modifications in the wing and fuselage designs of the newer models. These changes aim to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have played a crucial role in these developments, allowing for the optimization of design before physical prototypes are constructed. 55. Developments in Propulsion Systems. — Efforts to enhance the efficiency of propulsion systems continue, with a focus on both jet and propeller technologies. The introduction of composite fan blades has reduced the overall weight and improved the thrust-to-weight ratio of jet engines.	1912	1997.8016

It included a variety of works, from dramatic monologues to light-hearted comedies, showcasing his versatility as a performer. His ability to evoke a range of emotions from his audience made his readings highly popular, drawing a distinguished crowd that appreciated his unique artistry. Le Texier's readings were events of high cultural significance in London's social calendar, attended by notables from various circles including literature, politics, and the arts. His performances were often spoken of in the same breath as theatre outings, and many who could not secure a ticket to his crowded house readings would eagerly await reports and reviews in the newspapers. His dramatic interpretations were said to bring the written word to life, allowing his audience a more intimate connection with the literature than they might achieve through solitary reading. This talent made him a favorite in literary salons, where his performances could make the reputation of new works and revive interest in older ones. Despite his successes and the acclaim he garnered, Le Texier	1912	1976.8949
In pruning the main cane, leave about two thirds of the growth it has made but not more than four feet long. The vine should then be buried as directed for the previous year, and it will be found convenient to bend it as low as possible. To do this to the best advantage, take away a little soil from near the vine, to permit part of the bend to come near the ground. As the vine gets older and stiffer, it will bend most easily and safely below ground. Third season. The third spring the cane should be tied along the lower wire (fig. 112).	This will allow it to grow horizontally, which helps to encourage lateral branching and spread the growth more evenly. As the vine matures, new shoots will emerge from the buds along the cane. It is important to select the strongest and most favorably positioned shoots to retain as the main fruiting canes for the coming season. These selected shoots should be spaced about 6 to 10 inches apart to ensure adequate sunlight and air circulation, which are crucial for reducing disease risk and promoting healthy growth. Any shoots that are weak, poorly positioned, or excessively vigorous should be pruned away to concentrate the vine's energy into the more desirable branches. This selective pruning also helps to maintain the structure of the vine and prevents it from becoming overcrowded, which can lead to diminished fruit quality and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases. Additionally, any suckers growing from the base of the vine or from below the graft (if present) should be removed to prevent them from drawing resources away from the productive parts of the vine. As the growing season progresses, continue to monitor the vine for any new shoots that may need to	1914	2001.2415
"We have to thank Leonhard Weber, Summer, Kurlbaum, Martens Ulbricht, and Kriiss for apparatus which enables us to measure light with as much precision as is possible in other departments of physics. In the well-known workshops of Schmidt and Haensch and A. Kriiss these investigators have found fellow workers able to assimilate their ideas and develop them in a practical form. The investigations of medical officers of health, school authorities, and factory inspectors have greatly aided the perfecting of our methods of lighting and their practical applications. All these investigations have up till now stood more or less isolated, and their connexion with practical i lu mination was very slight. Owing to the existing publications on these subjects being sharply divided into two sections ("" practice "" and "" theory, "" so called), and because of the lack of an impartial platform for the free expression of opinion for representatives of divergent interests, difficulties have arisen which are quite unconnected with the nature of the problems to be considered."	It is imperative, therefore, that an integrated approach be established, one that bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementations in the field of illumination. A comprehensive journal or a series of conferences could serve as such a platform, facilitating dialogue among physicists, engineers, manufacturers, and end-users. This would not only enhance understanding but also accelerate the adoption of innovative lighting solutions that are both efficient and ergonomically sound. Moreover, the standardization of measurement techniques for light quality and intensity across different industries could be another significant step forward. Such standardization would ensure consistency and comparability of data, which is crucial for advancing research and improving application methodologies. Collaborative efforts could also extend to the development of new materials and technologies that push the boundaries of what is currently possible in lighting. In summary, by fostering a more collaborative environment and focusing on both the theoretical and practical aspects of lighting, we can expect to see significant advancements that will benefit a wide range of sectors, from medical to industrial and beyond. This holistic approach is not just beneficial but necessary for the continued evolution of the field.	1912	2006.1178
"The spear thrust is, however, not sufficient to fatally injure the animal, and it is therefore necessary for the natives to kill it, which is done by suffocation. Being a mammal, it is necessary for the Dugong to come to the surface to breathe. One of the natives dives overboard, and endeavours to insert a wooden plug into the animal's nostrils, and so cause suffocation; failing this, they usually tie a rope round its tail, and drag it down under the surface of the water, and so drown it; in the event of both these methods failing, they spear it through the nostrils."" The white man's method is equally cruel, and as the cows are killed off in large numbers for the sake of the oil, unless adequate protection is enforced, it can only be a matter of time before the Dugong will be exterminated in Queensland. Bones of the Dugong were met with during the excavation of Shea's Creek, which runs into Botany Bay. Hence the animal must formerly have extended much further south than at present."	"This historical range suggests that the Dugong once thrived in waters far beyond its current habitats, indicating a significant contraction in its geographical distribution over time. The reasons for this contraction are manifold, including hunting pressures, habitat destruction, and possibly changes in sea temperature and salinity affecting the seagrass beds on which they primarily feed. Conservation efforts are thus crucial to prevent the further decline of Dugong populations. These efforts include enforcing stricter hunting regulations, protecting their natural habitats, particularly the seagrass beds, and increasing awareness about the species' plight. Additionally, research into the historical ecology of the Dugong can provide insights into the factors that have led to its current status and help in crafting effective conservation strategies. Educational programs that inform the public about the ecological role of the Dugong and the threats it faces could also help in garnering support for conservation measures. The Dugong, often called the ""sea cow,"" plays a vital role in marine ecosystems, particularly in the health of seagrass beds. These beds are not only crucial for the survival of the D"	1909	2006.7021
Making a similar deduction in the case of Mars, but remembering that more of the regions near the poles would be habitable during part of the year than is the case on the earth (as there is practically no permanent glaciation and the temperate zones extend nearly to the poles) the habitable area would be reduced to, say, 15,000,000 square miles. It will thus be seen that although the total surface area of Mars is only rather more than one quarter of that of the earth, the area of its habitable land, 258  even under its present unfavourable circumstances, amounts to about half of the habitable area of the earth. Looking at Mars from this point of view, it does not contrast so unfavourably with the earth as is usually thought, especially when it is remembered how small a proportion of the earth's area is really populated. Were it not for the great eccentricity of the planet's orbit, the seasons upon Mars would be very much the same in the different zones as they are on our world, as the inclination of the planet's equator is only very slightly less than that of the earth.	Furthermore, the thin Martian atmosphere, while posing challenges for human-like life, might also contribute to more stable surface conditions over large areas, unlike Earth where weather patterns can be extremely variable. This could imply a more uniform climate across those habitable zones, potentially easing the adaptation of life forms or even future human colonization efforts. The presence of water ice at the poles and the possibility of ancient water flow patterns on the surface suggest that Mars, in its past, had a more Earth-like climate, which could have supported life forms. The Martian days, or sols, being only slightly longer than Earth days, also contribute to its potential habitability. This similarity in day length could mean that any plants or photosynthetic organisms might adapt more readily to the Martian environment than to planets with longer or more erratic rotational periods. The significant differences lie in atmospheric composition and surface pressure, which are critical factors for any form of Earth-like life. However, if these challenges can be managed, Mars presents a not entirely inhospitable environment for life.  In conclusion, while Mars certainly presents a harsher environment than	1911	2006.9259
No portents! yet with whisper and alarm The Evil Powers that dread the nearing feet Of heroes held a council in that hour And sent three fates to darken that low door, To baffle and beat back the heaven sent child. Three were the fates — gaunt Poverty that chains, Grey Drudgery that grinds the hope away, And gaping Ignorance that starves the soul. They came with secret laughters to destroy, Ever they dogged him, counting every step, Waylaid his youth and struggled for his life. They came to master but he made them serve, And from the wrestle with the destinies, He rose with all his energies aglow.

Drudgery's grey monotony he turned To disciplined routine, a rhythm that pulsed With the steady beat of an undaunted heart.  And Ignorance, that once threatened to choke The blossoming of his mind, became the soil From which his thirst for knowledge fiercely grew. He tilled it with the plow of perseverance, And reaped a harvest of enlightened thought.  Thus armored with the spoils of conquered fates, He marched undaunted through the opened door, His path alight with wisdom's radiant beams.

Lack of permanence in the screen and variation in the spectrum of the source itself must both be guarded against. In conclusion, it may be pointed out that a more exact definition of what constitutes daylight is needed. For example, the indirect illuiuinatiou from diffused daylight differs essentially from direct sunlight. Possibly a spectrum corresponding with average conditions might be adopted and imitated in artificial daylight units, and it may be hoped that we shall eventually have a more exact standard of what is required in this respect. I am, c., MAX PESCHKE.	It is essential that such a standard, once established, should be widely accepted and utilized in the fields of photography, cinematography, and even in the design of workspaces and public areas to ensure proper lighting conditions that mimic natural daylight as closely as possible. This would not only improve the aesthetic and functional quality of visual tasks but also contribute positively to the well-being and productivity of individuals. Further research should focus on measuring and defining the various qualitative aspects of daylight, including its intensity, color temperature, and dispersion. These factors could then be standardized in artificial lighting systems, providing consistent and reliable conditions regardless of the natural light available at any given time or location. Collaboration between physicists, engineers, psychologists, and industry professionals will be crucial in developing these standards. By combining expertise in light measurement and its psychological impacts, a comprehensive and practical framework can be established. This would pave the way for innovations in lighting technology that are scientifically sound and have a real-world application.	1912	2005.1202
The truth is, that party pride and party prejudice keep the radical or progressive voters apart. The power of party pride is great, and the power of party prejudice is still greater, to impel the average voter to retain his party affiliation long after devotion to principles should have  Waste of Progressive Energy 135 driven him to seek new alignment. As a consequence, we now see a lamentable dissipation of progressive energy. The divisions existing in both the Republican and the Democratic organisations are not factional, but are fundamental. Factional fights may be due to conflicting ambitions or squabbling for spoils and may be suppressed with resulting harmonious party action.	However, the divisions we now witness are rooted in differing philosophies about government and its role in society. These are not easily reconciled by compromise or the promise of party unity. Indeed, these ideological splits signify a deeper, more existential dilemma within the parties, challenging their very identities.  Thus, the progressive elements within both parties find themselves at odds not only with the conservative factions but also with the conventional party structures that resist change. This internal conflict dilutes the effectiveness of their advocacy, as much energy is consumed in intra-party disputes rather than in battling the opposition.  The need for a realignment is clear, where those of progressive inclination across parties can converge on a platform that champions reform and addresses the pressing issues of the time. Such a coalition would not only consolidate the scattered progressive forces but also potentially create a formidable challenge to the status quo, fostering a political environment conducive to substantive change.  Until such a realignment occurs, the progressive cause is likely to remain stymied by the very structures that should be facilitating its success. This is the paradox of progress within traditional party politics,	1911	2004.9286
"Then came the bitter cry: ""Oh, it's fierce to be poor! It's fierce!"" At the girl's outburst her mother's face lost the ruddy impudence that was its claim to beauty.

(Note also that predators in general are believed to miss far oftener than they succeed.) Many familiar experiences prove this fact, that one's power to catch or hit a moving object depends on the distinctness with which one sees it. The more brilliantly a dodging object shows against the background, the more promptly can the brain of the pursuer command the corresponding movement. Those who have tried to catch butterflies, houseflies or mosquitoes, on the wing, or shoot a flying bird, either know this by heart or will realise it the moment they try it again.	This principle extends beyond the mere physical pursuit of fleeting targets. In sports, for instance, a cricket or baseball player's ability to hit a fast-moving ball is critically dependent on how clearly they can see the ball as it approaches. The sharper the visual acuity, the better the timing and coordination of the swing. Similarly, in a game of tennis, the player's capacity to return a swift serve hinges on their ability to visually track the ball’s speed and trajectory against the varied backgrounds of sky and audience. The same holds true in the animal kingdom, where survival often depends on these split-second decisions. A hawk diving for its prey must have impeccable vision to discern its target amidst the ground’s textures. The clearer the image of the prey, the more precisely the hawk can adjust its angle and speed of descent. Thus, whether in nature or in human activity, the success of capturing or striking a moving object is intimately tied to the clarity with which the object is perceived. This dynamic interplay between vision and action underscores the critical role of perception in the execution of complex movements, whether for survival or	1911	2006.8463
Those millions of chemical processes which go on in the digestive apparatus of man became related to the ends of nourishing the body. What is the biological purpose of the brain and its functions ? Is it of any use to the life of man that excitements in the brain go on, and that as accompaniments mental states flash up? Such mere brain actrvity would be in itself as useless and worthless as the^eatmg of the heart would be if the heart had no connexion with arteries and veins and if these blood vessels were not connected with the lungs. The real usefulness of the heart is bound up with the functions of that larger apparatus which carries the oxygen of the inhaled air to all the tissues of the body.	Similarly, the real utility of the brain lies not merely in its internal operations but in how these operations interact with and influence the body's broader functioning and the individual's interaction with the environment. The brain's primary biological purpose is to serve as the center of the nervous system, coordinating mental and physical processes across the organism. It integrates sensory information, orchestrates responses through the nervous system, and enables complex cognitive functions that allow for planning, reasoning, and understanding. The brain's activities are critical for survival and adaptation. They enable an individual to perceive dangers, learn from experiences, and make decisions that enhance survival chances. These mental states and processes, although intangible, have profound implications on physical actions and behaviors. For instance, the perception of a threat triggers a cascade of neural and hormonal changes that prepare the body for a fight-or-flight response, mobilizing energy and focusing attention on the threat. Moreover, beyond immediate physical survival, brain functions facilitate social interaction and cultural development, which are also crucial for human survival and progression. The ability to communicate, empathize, and cooperate with others has been integral	1909	2006.3374
We have statistics to show the great waste of infant life in mansion as well as in humbler home. We have the statement of Professor Devine, the well-known charity expert, that in many homes we find the beginnings of tendencies which often lead to crime and disabling disease. We have the statements that innutritious food is a prolific cause of intemperance, which of itself leads to crime. We have the facts that much blindness and physical degeneracy might be prevented by a proper knowledge made available to the masses through the housemother in the home.	Moreover, the records of public health clearly indicate that overcrowded living conditions contribute significantly to the spread of infectious diseases, which disproportionately affect infants and young children. The importance of sanitary living environments cannot be overstated in the battle against infant mortality. It is essential that education on hygiene and proper nutrition be made accessible to all families, regardless of their socio-economic status. The role of the housemother is pivotal in this regard. She is often the primary caregiver and is in a unique position to influence the health and well-being of her family. By equipping her with the necessary knowledge and resources, we can ensure that she promotes healthy living practices within her home. This includes understanding the basics of balanced nutrition, the importance of vaccination, and the methods of maintaining a clean and healthy environment. Public health initiatives and educational programs must therefore be designed to reach these housemothers effectively. Community health workers could be trained to provide in-home visits to educate families, especially in underprivileged areas. Additionally, creating community centers that offer training sessions and resources about health and nutrition could empower more women to make informed decisions about their	1911	2005.8251
"Numerical data and diagrams substantiating this are presented. In the course of his remarks the speaker also pointed out that indirect lighting is not ' shadowless, "" but merely produces very soft shadows. The architectural appearance of pillars, alcoves, and recesses demands & certain amount of shadow. Turning next to practical applications of illumination, we may note BERTELMAN'S remarks on sign lighting (Licfit u. Lamp, May 9), in the course of which he protests against the frequent use of flame arcs at a low level ; such lamps, when used for shop fronts, should, he says, be hung at least 4 metres above the ground. The same journal has an account of an ingenious variety of fixtures made of basketwork. Li."	These fixtures, while unconventional, provide a unique aesthetic that complements modern and rustic interiors alike. The basketwork not only diffuses the light softly but also adds a textural element to spaces, enhancing the overall ambiance. Moreover, the use of natural materials aligns with the growing trend towards sustainability and eco-friendly design choices. Furthering the discussion on practical lighting applications, the speaker highlighted the increasing popularity of LED technology in both residential and commercial settings. LEDs offer significant advantages over traditional lighting solutions, including greater energy efficiency, longer lifespan, and improved environmental impact. The adaptability of LED systems allows for innovative integration into architectural designs, supporting both functional lighting needs and creative expression. In the realm of street lighting, the transition to LED has also been noted for its ability to reduce light pollution and enhance night-time visibility, which contributes to urban safety and aesthetic appeal. The speaker cited several cities that have successfully implemented LED street lighting projects, demonstrating substantial improvements in energy consumption and maintenance costs. Concluding the presentation, the speaker emphasized the importance of considering both aesthetic and practical aspects of lighting in architectural design.	1912	2007.2206
"For simple distributions of shear stress the resilience or elastic strain energy is easily calculated. Let Fig. 9 represent a piece of material of length Q  226 / perpendicular to the plane of the diagram, having uniform shear stress of intensity q on the face B.C., causing shear strain and deflection BB"". Then the resilience evidently is — \ X (force) X (distance) = \ x (B.C. . /. q) X BB"" = i. B.C. . /. q . AB, = \. B.C.. AB = a - xt X volume or 4* per unit of volume 2 N NV where N is the modulus of rigidity."	The expression derived gives us a clear understanding of how the resilience, or the ability of the material to absorb energy when deformed elastically, can be quantified. In this context, resilience is directly proportional to the volume of the material and the square of the applied shear stress, divided by the modulus of rigidity. This relationship highlights the importance of both material properties and geometric dimensions in determining the energy storage capacity under shear stress. To further elaborate, if we consider a material with a higher modulus of rigidity, it implies a stiffer material which can withstand greater stress for a given strain. Therefore, such materials would exhibit lower resilience per unit volume under the same stress conditions, as resilience is inversely proportional to the modulus of rigidity. Conversely, materials with lower values of modulus of rigidity would demonstrate higher resilience, indicating a greater ability to absorb energy before yielding. This principle is crucial in engineering applications where materials are subjected to dynamic loads and must exhibit adequate resilience to avoid failure. For example, in designing shock absorbers or components in seismic zones, materials with high resilience are preferred to dissip	1908	1993.2489
"On superior powers Were we to press, inferior might on ours; Or in the full creation leave a void, Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroyed. For the limitations of man's lot the sufficient consolation is that the principle of continuity requires them; in a system Where all must full or not coherent be, And all that rises, rise in due degree, — Then in the scale of reasoning life 'tis plain There must be, somewhere, such a rank as man. From the assumption of the same principle sprang the inquiries from which the science of anthropology may be said eventually to have originated. As a historian of the beginnings of that science has said: The question concerning the line of demarcation between man and the animal kingdom was plainly forced upon anthropology by the philosophy of Leibniz. The lex continui demanded the discovery of that ""grade"" (nuance) of existence among the higher organisms which comes nearest to the human species."	This quest for the nuanced gradation not only propelled the field of anthropology but also deeply influenced the parallel disciplines of biology and psychology. It was a pursuit that demanded an exploration of the subtleties of life, the intersections of human and animal behavior, and the complex interplay between nature and nurture. The unveiling of these nuances led to a more comprehensive understanding of man's place within the natural order, aligning with Leibniz's vision of a harmonious universe governed by a pre-established continuity. As studies progressed, anthropologists and biologists began to identify and analyze the cognitive and behavioral bridges that link humans with their primate relatives. They explored the development of tool use, language, and social structures, recognizing that these elements did not arise abruptly but evolved gradually. This continuity across species underscored the interconnectedness of all life forms and challenged the rigid classifications that had previously separated humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. Moreover, the influence of Leibniz's philosophy extended beyond academic circles and contributed to a broader cultural and ethical discourse. It raised questions about the moral responsibilities humans hold	1911	2007.6703

Whereupon the late Lord Coryston's executor produced an outline of the family history — up to date — for the bene  cut; fit of Lady Coryston's future son-in-law. Newbury, who was always singularly ignorant of the current gossip on such matters, received it with amazement. Nothing could be more unlike the strictly traditional ways which governed his own family in matters of money and inheritance. ""So Arthur inherits everything!"" ""Hm! — does he?"" said Sir Wilfrid.

The exact time to pick fruit can only be determined by    experience. A rule for this cannot be laid down for every claims of fruits. Time to Pick Fruit. Strawberries are picked when they begin to turn red, and raspberries when the fruits part readily from the stem on which they grow; blackberries and dewberries as soon as well coloured, although the flavour would generally be improved by allowing them to remain longer on the plants. Gooseberries are generally marketed green; currants are allowed to colour, but are not allowed to ripen and are generally preferred for jelly making when a few berries show some green colour. Cherries are picked as soon as well coloured. This will depend somewhat on the variety. Plums may be picked when they are well coloured.	Apples and pears should be harvested when they have reached full size and the seeds have turned brown, indicating maturity, but before they are fully ripe on the tree to avoid them becoming mealy or overripe. The background color of the fruit often changes from green to yellow or a lighter shade, depending on the variety, which is another indicator of the right picking time. Peaches and nectarines should be allowed to ripen until they are soft to the touch and the flesh near the stem gives slightly when pressed. This ensures the sugars have developed adequately, providing the best flavor. Apricots, similar to peaches, should be picked when they are soft and fully colored. Grapes are ready when they are fully colored and taste sweet, and the texture of the grape is consistent. Each bunch can ripen at different times, so it’s important to test a few grapes from different clusters. Citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, and limes, should be picked when they are fully colored and firm. The fruit should feel heavy for its size, indicating juic	1914	2002.5287
At this juncture the Gloucester, the last ship in the British line, dropped far astern ; she had received in quick succession half a dozen heavy German shells on her 6 in. armour and had sprung a serious leak. The German ships closed on her, coming in to less than 2000 yards, when their guns battered her with ever increasing effect. She sank deeper in the water, heading for the coast, with the Germans in hot pursuit firing continuously at her. The other three cruisers were preparing to turn and go to her aid — a course which would certainly have involved the annihilation of the First Cruiser Squadron — when welcome help appeared. To the west a column of great ships was made out coming up at impetuous speed from the Upper Forth.	It was the Second Battle Squadron, led by Admiral Graves. Their formidable dreadnoughts, with guns far superior in range and power to those of the cruisers, quickly drew the attention of the German fleet. As the dreadnoughts approached, their massive 12-inch guns thundered, sending salvo after salvo towards the German ships, which were now forced to reconsider their aggressive pursuit. The presence of the new squadron provided a strategic advantage that the British desperately needed. The Germans, recognizing the threat of the larger and more heavily armed battleships, began to pull back, breaking off their attack on the beleaguered Gloucester. The German ships increased their distance, maneuvering to avoid the incoming fire, which splashed ominously close to their hulls. Admiral Graves signaled the First Cruiser Squadron to continue their retreat, while his squadron took over the engagement. The Gloucester, severely damaged and listing, managed to make slow progress towards the coast under the cover of the dreadnoughts' firepower. Meanwhile, the air was thick with the smoke of gunpow	1906	1952.1641
This appears to be a step in the right direction. Presumably in the case of an inquiry following an accident the examination would be specially exhaustive. New Methods in Photometry. Efforts are still being made to improve photometric apparatus and new instruments 'are constantly being introduced. Quite a remarkable series of novelties was shown at the recent Optical Convention in London. In the present number Prof. Rumi, of Genoa, describes a new form of photometer devised by him, and we notice that Dr. Sharp and Mr. Millar have just designed a new illuminometer in the United States.	"This device, which they have named the ""Luminoscope,"" promises significant advancements in measuring light intensity and distribution, particularly in industrial settings. Their invention is designed to provide more accurate readings in less time, and with greater ease of use than traditional photometers. The Luminoscope employs a novel sensor arrangement that allows for simultaneous multiple point measurements, which could revolutionize the way lighting audits are conducted. Furthermore, the advancements in photometric technology are not limited to hardware. There is also a growing interest in the development of software solutions that can analyze and interpret photometric data more effectively. These software tools aim to provide deeper insights into light quality and its impacts on various environments, from workplaces to public spaces. As the field of photometry continues to evolve, these innovations are expected to lead to better optimized lighting solutions that enhance visual comfort, reduce energy consumption, and contribute to the overall well-being of individuals. The implications of these technological advancements are vast, promising not only to refine our understanding of light but also to improve the quality of life in illuminated spaces around the globe."	1912	1999.8317
It means that the people are gaining the faculty collectively to focus and coordinate the myriad rays of their converging interests, and so to act upon them as to promote their own collective welfare. It means that the body politic is developing a nervous system that is giving quicker action and reaction in the functions of government. And this means a quickened sense on the part of the people as to the nature of their organic life, and a keener knowledge of how to shape their own destiny. One would think from the remarks of some of the apologists of the present system, that the judiciary is the chief part of the national organism, and the people a kind of unnecessary appendage thereto.	Yet, it is clear that the true vitality and strength of a nation derive from its people—their energies, their collective will, and their capacity to adapt and innovate. The judiciary, while crucial in maintaining law and order and interpreting laws, should function as a means to facilitate the collective will of the people, not suppress it. As the body politic evolves, it is imperative that all branches of government, including the judiciary, align with this dynamic and ever-changing collective will. The development of a responsive and coordinated body politic also suggests a maturing of democratic processes. It is a progression toward a more direct and participative form of governance where the voices of the citizens are not just heard but are also instrumental in shaping policy and decision-making. This enhanced engagement leads to a more informed citizenry, capable of making decisions that reflect the nuanced complexities of modern life. Such a transformation in the body politic requires an educational system that encourages critical thinking and a robust civil society that can mobilize and channel public opinion. Furthermore, it necessitates a transparent government that not only listens to but also acts on the input	1911	1996.1661
The importance of the perception of relative difference was a point of view which was very generally overlooked. For instance, if they took a sheet of printed paper, the white light reflected from the black type was about one fifteenth of the light reflected from the white paper. At midday, fifty times as much light was reflected from the white as in the morning, whilst the black type was actually reflecting nearly 3i times more light than the white by morning light. Again, if they held up a piece of grey paper in front of a window in a room with whitewashed walls that paper would look grey, though it was reflecting far more light than the light which wan reflected from a corresponding area of the wall.	This perception of difference, rather than the absolute measure of light, was crucial for the human eye to discern and interpret the various objects and scenes before it. The eye, thus, does not operate on a scale of absolute brightness, but rather on a scale of relative brightness, comparing the lightness or darkness of different areas against each other. This is what allows us to see details in a wide range of lighting conditions, from the dimly lit corners of a room to the bright glare of the noonday sun. Understanding this principle has significant implications not only in fields such as photography and visual arts, where the manipulation of light and shadow is fundamental, but also in the design of visual displays and in the development of algorithms for image processing. By adjusting contrasts rather than absolute light levels, more effective and efficient visual representations can be achieved, enhancing both aesthetic qualities and functional visibility. Moreover, this principle is applied in the technology behind various devices such as cameras and computer screens, which must interpret and reproduce images and scenes under diverse lighting conditions. The ability to adjust to the relative lightness or darkness of pixels	1912	1977.0718
Whether it be want of time, or want of energy, or want of knowledge, it matters not: the result is one and the same — the child loses in the race. To keep his child free from disease; to fit his child by education for the work of the complex society he is to live in, — these are two primary duties of the father and, except in the poorest, most insufficient way, he cannot of himself either mentally or physically perform either the one or the other. He is driven by every social force, by every social ambition, by every good impulse, to seek for a means to keep his child alive and to inform his child's mind. To require, without conditions, that every father individually shall provide hospital and school for his child is to throw our society back, to give up an immense privilege without providing any compensation. Any social theory cannot, if it insists on such impossibilities as these, be regarded as of any consequence.	The solution, then, must be found in collective action; in society taking upon itself the role of the universal parent, providing the necessary institutions and supports that no single individual could afford or maintain on his own. It is in public health measures, in sanitation, in compulsory education, where the state steps in to ensure that the basic necessities are not merely privileges for the affluent but rights for all. This is not merely a charitable act but a fundamental necessity for the progress and stability of society itself. If a child grows up malnourished, uneducated, and sickly, how can he be expected to contribute effectively to the commonwealth? How can he even exercise those political rights and responsibilities upon which our democratic society is built? Thus, the state must intervene. It must build hospitals accessible to all, schools where every child may learn, not just the rudiments of reading and writing, but the critical and creative thinking skills necessary for the jobs of tomorrow. It must ensure that these institutions are not only available but are of a quality that does not differ whether one is born in wealth or poverty	1908	1906.0609
"These bangs became more frequent and more violent, and at last succeeded each other with such rapidity that it seemed almost as though a vigorous cannonade were in progress. I was wondering what could be the meaning of all this commotion, when suddenly the door opened, and John rushed into the room looking very cross indeed. "" I'M sorry, Professor, "" he cried, "" though it's no use saying so ; but we must go back to England again at once !"" ""Good gracious, John!"" I exclaimed, ""what do you mean, and whatever has happened to upset you so and cause you to change your mind in this extraordinary way ? "" ""The deluge has happened, "" he replied, very crossly. "" Professor, I'Ve left all my stock of tobacco behind!"" "" Never, John, "" I replied. """	"""Surely we can procure some tobacco here? We are not yet so far removed from civilization!""  John shook his head despondently. ""It's not the same, Professor. You know I only smoke that special blend from Jermyn Street. It's irreplaceable here."" His distress was palpable, and though it seemed a trivial matter to be so upset over, I knew John's habits well. His day was punctuated by those quiet moments with his pipe, and without them, he was like a ship without a rudder. ""But John,"" I tried to reason, ""consider the journey back. The time lost could be detrimental to our expedition. Is there truly no alternative that could suffice temporarily?"" He paced the room, clearly agitated, running his hands through his hair. ""I've tried the local blends, Professor. They are harsh and quite intolerable. I fear without my usual supply, I shall be quite out of sorts."" Seeing his genuine distress, I knew we had to find a solution. ""Very well, John. Let us think. Perhaps"	1911	1907.5192
Similar experiments on models of other types of machines have been commenced and are in progress; and indications are given in the report as to the extent to which the conclusions arrived at with respect to the type examined may be expected to hold good generally for other machines. The methods of forming the equations of motion will by now be familiar to most workers on the subject. They have been developed by Lanchester, Bryan, Ferber, Painleve, Botheznt, Reissner, Knoller, Crocco, and others. The mathematical methods here employed closely follow those used by Bryan: the modifications introduced have been suggested mainly from an examination of the experimental data applicable to an actual aeroplane; an is well known. »  140 Bryan's calculations are made for an ideally simplified machine: they lead to conclusions in general agreement, so far as comparison is possible, with those here put forward.	The theoretical framework has been further enriched and made more practical by incorporating the effects of factors like air resistance, structural flexibility, and propeller dynamics, which Bryan had largely neglected. This approach not only offers a more realistic simulation of aerodynamic behavior but also allows for a better prediction of stability and control characteristics under varying flight conditions. In the current series of experiments, various configurations of wing shapes, tail arrangements, and body designs are being tested. Each model is subjected to rigorous wind tunnel testing, where force and pressure distribution measurements are taken at multiple points along the aircraft's surface. This data is then used to refine the mathematical models, ensuring they closely mimic the physical behavior observed in the tests. These comprehensive analyses are critical as they provide insights into the aerodynamic performance and mechanical stresses that different aircraft structures endure. Such information is invaluable for designing safer, more efficient, and economically viable flying machines. As this field of research progresses, it is anticipated that the findings from these diverse model studies will lead to a unified theory of aerodynamics that can be applied universally across various types of flight technology.	1912	2006.8314
"Saint Jerome says: ""Opulence is always the product of theft committed, if not by the actual possessor, by his ancestors."" Saint Ambrose says: ""Nature created community, private property is the offspring of usurpation."" Saint Clement says: ""In strict justice everything should belong to all. Iniquity alone has created private property."" Moreover, it would not be difficult to prove by pretty good evidence that the early Christian church was a thoroughly communistic body, and that its successors have been and are the worst kind of recreants in this particular. (Acts III."	"44-45: ""And all that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need."") This communal spirit, where goods were shared and none were left wanting, reflects the core principles that governed the early followers of Christianity. The stark contrast between these practices and the later accumulations of wealth by the church is a point of contention and debate among theologians and historians alike. The divergence from these early ideals to the wealth and opulence often associated with the church in later centuries is seen by some as a betrayal of the original teachings of Christ and his apostles. This transformation from a community of shared resources to an institution of significant worldly wealth raises questions about the influences of power, corruption, and the human inclination towards greed and control. This shift also mirrors broader societal changes where communal living gave way to structured societal hierarchies and the establishment of private property as a norm. The early church's approach challenges contemporary notions of property and wealth, suggesting a model of living that prioritizes community and collective well-being"	1911	1909.6542
A form of this, sometimes known botanically as Prunus nigra and having some quite evident characteristics of its own, is found somewhat north of the range of the typical Prunus americana. Good examples of this are the Cheney and Aitkin, both of which flower early and mature their fruit early. Plums of this class seem to do best in northern Minnesota, northern North Dakota and Manitoba. (e) The Wild Goose group (Prunus nortulana), represents a group of plums that seem especially adapted to southern Iowa, Missouri, southern Illinois and adjacent sections. Among these are such well known popular varieties as Wild Goose and Wayland. (f) The Chickasaw group (Prunus angustifolia or P. chica sa) are native to the Southern states and include such varieties as Newman, Pottawatomie and Lone Star. Bailey classifies the various varieties of the Prunus domestica substantially as follows:  Prunes. These are known by their sweet, firm flesh, which contains enough sugar to permit of their being dried and made a commercial product.	European Plums. These are typically larger and have a more diverse range of flavors and textures compared to prunes. Varieties like the Italian Prune (which can also be dried into prunes), Green Gage, and Victoria are well-known in this category. They are widely cultivated not only for fresh consumption but also for culinary uses, such as in jams and desserts. Damsons. These are small, tart plums typically used in cooking because of their rich flavor once cooked. They make excellent preserves, such as jams and jellies, and are also used in baking. Mirabelles. Small and sweet, mirabelles are most often found in the Lorraine region of France where they are used to make jam and the famous eau-de-vie, a clear, colorless fruit brandy. Gages. A subgroup of European plums, gages are usually green or yellow and are prized for their dessert-quality sweetness and juicy texture. They are considered by many to be superior in flavor to other European varieties and are often eaten fresh. Each of these groups represents a unique	1914	2003.0676
There were a hundred willing hearts; there was the cool, directing head of the squire; there were the mighty shoulders of the Gaumers and the Fackenthals and the Knerrs and the Kuhnses. Some of them wept as they worked. They forgot the danger to which every living thing seemed to be exposed; they forgot their own homes; and while Lizzie and Anna and Susannah Kuhns watched in horror, they toiled like giants. Frequently they shouted, but there was no answer. As their hearts sank lower, they worked the harder. Lizzie and Anna refused to go away; they stood together dumbly watching what seemed like the opeuing of a grave. Suddenly there was a lull in the wind, and at the squire's command a great section of the fence was lifted and flung away from the little house.	"Instantly, a cheer rose up from the men as they saw the first signs of success. The squire, wiping the sweat from his brow, called for more hands to help. The women, seeing the progress, found a renewed hope and joined in the efforts, passing tools and clearing debris with a fervor matched only by the men.  Under the relentless sun, the community worked as one, their faces grimy, clothes tattered, but spirits unbroken. As they dug further, the urgency increased. Every shovel of dirt removed was a step closer to their goal, every plank pulled away a beacon of hope.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, a faint cry could be heard from beneath the wreckage. It was weak, but unmistakable. A surge of energy propelled the rescuers as they redoubled their efforts. The squire, directing with precision, urged them on with a voice that was both commanding and encouraging. ""Careful now, boys! Easy does it!"" he shouted as they uncovered the last layer of debris. There, amidst the broken wood"	1913	1977.5531
"And, despite my desire to conserve my goods for use in the farther country, I was forced to bestow ""gifts"" in return for their ""presents"" of food and basketry. At this point it was clear that a crisis  910 had been reached; the supplies in hand were insufficient for a safe journey to Roraima and thence back to this point. Two courses were open for choice. I could cross the river and penetrate for some distance into Brazil for the purpose of studying the life of the savannas at their northern limit, and then return within the margin of safety set by the stores in hand."	Alternatively, I could turn back and make for the nearest settlement, replenishing my supplies and then attempting the journey to Roraima once more, this time with ample provisions. The former option held a certain allure—unexplored territories, the chance to document and study unknown flora and fauna, the thrill of extending the boundaries of known geography. However, the latter was dictated by prudence. The risk of venturing further with limited supplies could lead to dire straits, especially given the unpredictability of the terrain and potential encounters with unfriendly tribes or dangerous wildlife. After much deliberation, weighing the potential gains against the very real risks, I decided to retreat to the nearest settlement. This decision, though frustrating to my explorative spirit, was necessary to ensure the safety of my team and the success of the expedition. Once resupplied and perhaps reinforced with additional guides or bearers familiar with the region, I could undertake the journey to Mount Roraima with a greater assurance of success and safety. Thus resolved, I began organizing the return trek, instructing my crew to carefully	1913	1968.0032

For beams of varying breadth, the situation becomes more complex. As the breadth of the beam changes along its length, so too does the section modulus, Z. This alteration affects the distribution of stress and strain across the beam, leading to variations in the bending moment, M, that can be sustained at different points along the beam's length. If the breadth of the beam varies linearly, the section modulus Z for a rectangular cross-section can be expressed as \( Z(x) = \frac{b(x)d^2}{6} \), where \( b(x) \) represents the breadth of the beam at any point \( x \) along its length, and \( d \) is the constant depth. The bending moment equation thus becomes \( \frac{M(x)}{Z(x)} = \frac{6M(x)}{b(x)d^2} \), which must remain constant for uniform strength according to the condition \( \frac{M}{Z} = \text{constant} \). To maintain this condition, the design must ensure that \( M(x) \)	1908	1972.5107

One of them enacted the part of a torero at a bull fight, stamping round first in a green satin cloak which she then waved before a man's felt hat thrown on the ground to represent the bull hemmed about with banderillas stuck quivering into the floor. But the prettiest thing was the dancing of two little girl pupils, one fair and thin and of an angelic gracefulness, and the other plump and dark, who was as dramatic as the blond was lyrical. They accompanied themselves with castanets, and though the little fading toed in and wore a common dress of blue striped gingham, I am afraid she won our hearts from her graceful rival.	The contrast between the two could hardly have been more striking, yet each brought her own unique charm to the performance. The fair-haired girl moved with a fluidity that seemed almost otherworldly, her delicate steps tracing patterns on the air as if she were sketching music with her feet. Her movements were soft and flowing, a gentle stream of dance that captivated the audience with its serene beauty. On the other hand, the darker girl danced with a fire and passion that was impossible to ignore. Every stamp of her foot and snap of her castanets was a declaration, a bold and spirited expression of her inner vitality. Her eyes sparkled with intensity as she interpreted the music not just with her body but with her whole being, drawing the audience into the narrative she wove with her vigorous motions. Together, they created a harmonious balance, a dance that spoke of both the ethereal and the earthly, the tranquil and the tempestuous. The audience was enchanted, caught up in the magic of their performance, where each girl shone in her own right yet complemented her partner	1913	1980.7103
This reaches its fullest expansion only when the teacher's idealism does not turn merely to the content of instruction and to the task of teaching, but irradiates in every direction. There are windows in every class room; the right teacher will look out from his desk into the wide world, into the turmoil of men, into the joys and duties of life, and everywhere it will be felt whether he sees things  317   in the narrow, selfish aspect, or with a heart that believes in the eternal values. Everything, indeed, may be looked on in a trivial way or in a way full of belief. The beauties of nature and art become for the one mere pleasures of sense, while to the other they are sources of true inspiration endlessly valuable in their inner perfection.	The teacher who sees with such an expansive vision brings to his classroom not just knowledge, but wisdom. He does not merely impart facts, but kindles the spirit of inquiry and the love of truth in his students. His teachings do not end at the school bell; they linger in the minds of his pupils, encouraging them to explore, to question, and to appreciate the interconnectedness of all knowledge. Such a teacher understands that education is not a mere transfer of information, but a transformative experience that shapes the character and destiny of individuals. He appreciates that his influence extends beyond the academic success of his students, touching upon their moral and spiritual growth. In his classroom, lessons are not confined to textbooks. Life itself is a textbook, rich with lessons on resilience, ethics, empathy, and the pursuit of excellence. By integrating the realities of the outside world into his teaching, the right teacher helps his students to navigate the complexities of life with courage and integrity. He shows them that every subject, be it mathematics, science, literature, or history, is not just a body of knowledge, but a	1909	1918.6359
The schools still carry with them too much of that Germany which lived and thought but which was politically powerless and in the practical world helpless. The new German who does not look into the clouds but prefers to stand with both feet firm on the ground wants knowledge of natural science instead of languages, wants development toward national patriotism instead of religion in school, and wants civics instead of archaeology. The centre of it all is the firm demand that the youth be prepared for the national life with its social demands and its realistic energies. The character is to be developed still more than the intellect, and the mind is to be schooled for a time which overstrains a man unless he is trained for concentration. Of course much superficiality and pedagogical amateurishness are in play there. Especially the educational value of the natural sciences is still a very doubtful claim in the eyes of those who have really watched the outcome.	Yet, the shifting focus towards pragmatic and utilitarian disciplines reflects a broader societal transformation—a response to the industrial and technological advancements that are reshaping the German landscape. This new educational paradigm seeks to cultivate a generation capable of navigating and contributing to a rapidly modernizing world. It emphasizes the importance of technical proficiency and a robust work ethic, qualities deemed essential for the economic and military strengthening of the nation. However, this shift is not without its critics. Traditionalists argue that the abandonment of classical education undermines the cultural and philosophical foundations that have long been the cornerstone of German identity. They fear that the neglect of the humanities may lead to a loss of moral and ethical sensibilities among the youth, potentially engendering a mechanically efficient yet spiritually barren society. In this debate, the challenge lies in balancing the demands of national progress with the preservation of cultural heritage. It is a delicate equilibrium between fostering a technically adept workforce and ensuring that the students remain connected to the deeper, historical roots that offer a sense of identity and continuity. Thus, while the push towards science and technology is undeniably necessary, it must	1911	2007.2747
"Mr. Slipher, who accompanied Professor Todd's expedition to Alianza in Chilli, at the opposition of 1907, together with the observers at Flagstaff, discovered no less than 85 new canals, including some doubles, nearly all being in the more southern portions of the southern hemisphere. "" In addition to the discovery of so many fine lines, we also owe to the acumen of Professor Lowell a reasonable explanation of what they really are. Schiaparelli termed them 'canali, ' an Italian term for ' channels, ' but, popularly, this soon became corrupted into the term 'canals, ' and this has turned out to be a much more appropriate word than such corruptions usually are. 138  From a G.'obt made by Af. ll'icks Plate IX MARS."	The idea that these canals were artificial constructs, perhaps the work of an intelligent Martian civilization, was a compelling hypothesis for many. Lowell further theorized that these canals were used for the purpose of irrigating the arid Martian landscape by directing water from the polar ice caps to the equatorial regions, where it was desperately needed. This theory sparked the imagination of the public and scientists alike, leading to a surge in interest in Martian studies. However, as our observational techniques improved and our understanding of Mars deepened, it became evident that the canals were not the work of intelligent beings but rather natural features of the Martian landscape. The term 'canals' persisted in the lexicon, but their understanding shifted from artificial waterways to natural geological formations, possibly the result of ancient river beds or tectonic activity. Despite this shift in understanding, the initial excitement generated by Lowell's observations and theories had a lasting impact on the scientific community. It spurred further research into Mars and its environment, leading to numerous missions and studies aimed at uncovering the secrets of the Red Planet. The legacy of	1911	1997.5708
If straight •women are, what about straight girls? In the spring of 1889 my father, a widower, and schoolmaster in a midland town, died from the result of an accident, leaving my sister and me orphaned, with £40 a year between us. I was barely fifteen, my sister eighteen. We were just ordinary healthy, intelligent girls, with the usual middle class school education, not particularly trained for anything except to be companionable and bright. My father at forty-three, the age at which he died, was an extraordinarily young and vigorous man for his age. If Fate had not intervened, he might have lived another thirty or forty years. We had very few relations. My father cared very little for any of his; and when my sister proposed our trying our luck in London, no one dreamed of preventing us doing so.	We arrived in London with only our modest savings and a great deal of determination. My sister, with her more mature age and stronger disposition, took the lead. We rented a small but neat room in a respectable part of the city and began our search for employment. The task was daunting. London was teeming with young women in similar circumstances, all vying for the limited positions that could provide a decent living. Initially, we took on whatever work we could find. My sister found employment as a governess while I worked as a shop assistant. The hours were long, and the pay was meager, but it was enough to keep us afloat. Our evenings were spent scouring the newspapers for better opportunities, and slowly but surely, we began to make progress. As we became more accustomed to the rhythms of city life, our initial trepidation gave way to a cautious optimism. We attended night classes when we could afford them, learning shorthand and typewriting, skills in high demand. We knew that education was our ticket to better employment, and we were determined to make the most	1911	1965.8982

Her nieces were on either side of her; they followed her as she left the room, comforting, soothing, creating a hubbub of sound that effectually assisted Mr. Tate in the idea that some one had gone suddenly mad, and that it was perhaps himself.

". . . Every high school that has a natural agricultural constituency of any considerable importance should put in a department of agriculture on the same basis as its department of chemistry."" — Davenport, ""Education for Efficiency, "" p. 126. ""A thorough grounding in the natural sciences is essential to thorough agricultural courses, but so long as the instruction is confined to the departments of pure science it has had, and will have, very little significance or importance to agriculture. . . . '' If the divisions of science were strictly adhered to we should have no such thing as agricultural science. ."	For agriculture is not merely chemistry, nor biology, nor botany; it is all these and more. It is the application of a composite of sciences to the practical work of managing and understanding the operations of the farm. The farmer must be an ecologist, a meteorologist, an economist, and a conservationist. He must understand the soil not just as a medium in which plants grow, but as a dynamic system interacting with the plants, the atmosphere, and the water cycle. Therefore, the educational programs aimed at preparing students for a career in agriculture must transcend traditional boundaries of individual disciplines. They must offer a holistic approach that integrates various scientific, economic, and practical aspects of farming and land management. This integration is essential to equip future farmers with the knowledge and skills required to manage the complexities of modern agricultural systems effectively. Such programs should include hands-on experiences where students can engage directly with the land, crops, and animals. This practical exposure, combined with theoretical knowledge, helps in nurturing a deeper understanding and respect for the natural processes that govern agricultural systems. It also instills a sense of steward	1911	1996.5837
These simple cases must stand as typical of all similar transactions. 4. While the money world continues, the group will need coin money for many purposes, and amongst its members there will be some people earning and some owning money. Here it is possible for the ordinary terms of tenure, payable in the old money, to be arranged between the group and the member — say G — for a strictly limited period, and for specified uses. This can happen but rarely, since the Theory inspires the group to keep their land, as much as possible, sacred to experiments in the new form of organisation and exchange, as well as to hold a reserve for prospective comers.	5. The principle of mutual assistance that is fundamental to the group's philosophy ensures that all members contribute according to their abilities and receive according to their needs. This communal approach helps to minimize the reliance on traditional forms of currency and promotes a more equitable distribution of resources within the group. 6. Transactions within the group are primarily based on barter and reciprocal labor, fostering a closer relationship among members and a deeper connection to the communal goals. It is understood that this system, while distinct from the prevailing economic structures, is not without its challenges, particularly in interfacing with the broader money-driven economy. 7. However, in instances where external transactions are necessary, or when dealing with entities outside of the community, traditional currency may still be used. In such cases, the group collectively decides on the allocation of monetary resources to ensure that these engagements are in line with their overarching objectives and values. 8. The integration of new members into this system is handled with care, with initial orientations and gradual involvement in economic activities. This ensures that all members fully understand the community's economic principles and practices, and are well	1911	2005.4663
"I would like to ask the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for War, "" he said, "" whether it is not a fact that soon after noon today the enemy, having moved his heavy artillery to certain positions commanding North London, and finding the capital strongly barricaded, proceeded to bombard it ? Whether that bombardment, according to the latest dispatches, is not still continuing at this moment ; whether it is not a fact that enormous damage has already been done to many of the principal buildings of the metropolis, including the Government Offices at Whitehall, and whether great loss of life has not been occasioned ? "" The question produced the utmost sensation. The House during the whole afternoon had been in breathless anxiety as to what was actually happening in London ; but the Government held the telegraphs and telephone, and the only private dispatches that had come to Bristol were the two received by some roundabout route known only to the ingenious journalists who had dispatched them. Indeed, the dispatches had been conveyed the greater portion of the way by motor car."	"The Secretary of State for War rose, his demeanor calm but his voice carrying an undercurrent of grave concern. ""Honorable Member,"" he began, addressing the chamber with a measured tone, ""the reports you have mentioned are indeed correct. At approximately 12:15 PM, enemy forces adjusted their artillery to target strategic locations within North London. The capital, foreseeing potential threats, had been fortified accordingly, yet the intensity of the bombardment has been such that significant damage has been inflicted upon our beloved city."" He paused, allowing the weight of his words to permeate the room before continuing. ""As for the ongoing status of this dire assault, I can confirm that the bombardment has not ceased. Our forces are engaged as we speak, endeavoring to neutralize this threat with all due haste. Regarding the damage to our principal buildings, including those at Whitehall, it is substantial.

The larger trees seen in the background are some distance to the northwest of the buildings. The small photographs, Figs. 2 and 3, show the two methods employed in the exploration of the air movements. (1) A small rubber balloon inflated with sufficient hydrogen to give zero lift was attached by a short string to the end of a bamboo pole and the direction of the tethering string used as an indication of the wind direction, and (2) a fire was lit in a portable grate and fed with damp fuel to give off a cloud of light coloured smoke, the drift of which showed the motion of the air. The results of the observations are set out in Fig.	4, which presents a series of plotted wind vectors over the course of the day. Each vector represents the average direction and velocity of the wind as measured during each observation period. The wind generally traveled from the southwest to the northeast, but with significant variations at different times of the day. Morning observations indicated a lighter breeze, while the winds picked up considerably in the afternoon, corroborating the typical diurnal wind pattern observed in the area. In addition to the graphical representation, the data was further analyzed to assess the stability and variability of the wind over the observation period. Statistical analysis showed a standard deviation in wind direction suggesting occasional gusts altering the general wind flow. These gusts were particularly noticeable during mid-day, likely influenced by thermal heating effects on the local topography. Further experiments with the smoke method revealed that the smoke dispersion provided detailed insights into turbulence and eddy formations close to the ground level. This was particularly useful in understanding how wind movements might affect smaller structures or vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the test site. These methods, though simple, proved effective in providing a foundational understanding of local aer	1912	1968.1824

('I‘enn.)	549; and compare the decision in Milligan v. Wedge, 12 Ad. & Ell. 737, where the principles laid down were markedly affirmed. The essence of these cases revolves around the obligations and rights conferred upon corporate entities and their interactions with other bodies, be they public or private. In examining the precedents set by these notable cases, one can discern a clear pattern of judicial reasoning that seeks to balance the interests of corporate governance with the rights of individuals and competing entities. Moreover, the ruling in East River Gas L. Co. v. Donnelly elucidates the boundaries of corporate liability and the extent to which a company can claim immunity under municipal protections. This case, along with others cited, such as Dillon's Municipal Corporations and the judgments in the Tennessee courts, underscores the evolving nature of corporate law in the face of changing economic and social landscapes. It is imperative to understand that these cases do not stand in isolation but rather contribute to a broader jurisprudential framework that guides contemporary legal interpretations of municipal and corporate interactions. This framework is instrumental in shaping the policies that	1913	1956.4171
— The body or board or council accepting the bids must determine whether the lowest bidder is responsible and shows the ability and osiers the security prescribed; and if the bid is not rejected because of a b0 naﬁde determination of the lack of such qualifications, it cannot be rejected for other extraneous causes.‘ The word “responsible ” has been held not to have reference to pecuniary ability alone, but to have reference to the skill, ability, and integrity of the bidder, and that it is proper to consider which bidder would be most likely to do faithful, conscientious work The word “responsible” has been held to mean the ability to perform all the conditions of the contract; and the commissioner of public works may reject a bid, notwithstanding it is the lowest made, and the bidder is able to give the required bond, if, in the judgement of such official, after due investigation, the materials customarily used and the workmanship exhibited by the bidder in the performance of the kind of work required are poor and unsatisfactory. ° The discretion must be exercised in good faith and without fraud or collusion; 7 and such a power to dispense with certain requirements conferred upon a board or council by act of legislature being discretionary, it cannot be delegated The board cannot exercise an arbitrary discretion in awarding the contract, but must base its discretion on facts reasonably tending to support its determination.’ It seems that evidence is admissible to impeach the contract and show  People 12 Willis (Sup. ), 39 N.

Moreover, the courts have consistently held that the decision of a public body in determining the responsibility of a bidder must be based on substantial evidence and not on capricious or irrelevant factors. This ensures that the process remains fair and transparent, safeguarding the public interest. In cases where the decision to reject a bid is challenged, the reviewing court will generally not substitute its judgment for that of the body or board, provided the decision was made within the bounds of reasonable discretion. However, if it is demonstrated that the decision was based on improper considerations or was fundamentally unfair, the court may intervene to correct the action. Furthermore, it is essential that the criteria used to judge the responsibility of bidders are clearly outlined prior to the bidding process and applied consistently to all participants. This prevents any appearance of bias or favoritism and maintains the integrity of the procurement process. Any deviation from these established criteria without a legitimate and well-documented reason can lead to legal challenges and potential invalidation of the bidding results	1913	1962.0776
There is no way of telling from the way the work is going on that it is not a job in the hands of a successful railroad builder; yet it is simply an increasing body of workingmen who are trying individually and collectively to show that they are as capable of managing their own jobs as the private contractor. When the elevation is done they will build the tracks, the interlocking switches, and all the details of a complete terminal system. The great division of co operative masons who are at work on the station, one of the largest parts of the contract, are armed with much experience. They are also erecting homes for working people out of a fund the Banco.	Popular has established, demonstrating their dual commitment to their craft and their community. This cooperative effort is not only providing employment but also fostering a sense of ownership and pride among the workers. The project, managed directly by the workers' cooperative, is breaking new ground in how large-scale infrastructure projects can be handled, setting a precedent for future endeavors. The workers' cooperative model is being closely observed by various economic and social theorists as a potential blueprint for future public works. The success of this project could lead to a reevaluation of traditional labor and management structures across other sectors as well. Already, there are discussions about expanding this model to other cities and possibly other types of projects beyond railway systems. This approach has not been without its challenges. Coordination on such a large scale, with hundreds of workers having equal say, requires meticulous planning and continuous communication. Nevertheless, the cooperative has implemented democratic decision-making processes that allow for smooth operations and collective problem-solving. The sense of camaraderie and the shared goal of completing the terminal efficiently and to the highest standards have driven these workers to innovate in ways traditional management structures	1913	2007.5624
man 0. Bates, 15 Neb. 18.	In the case of Bates v. State, the court was presented with a matter involving the interpretation of statutory law in the context of property rights and trespass. The legal arguments centered around the precise definitions within the statute and whether Mr. Bates' actions fell within those parameters. The court meticulously analyzed the language of the law, considering both the literal and broader implications of the terms used. The justices delved into historical precedents, comparing similar cases and their outcomes, to ensure a consistent application of justice. They also considered the intent of the legislature when the statute was written, seeking to honor that intent while applying the law to modern circumstances. The decision was not reached lightly. Each justice weighed in, contributing their interpretation and understanding of the law. The majority opinion held that Bates' actions did indeed constitute a violation of the statute, citing clear precedents and a firm understanding of the legislative purpose. However, dissenting opinions were also present, arguing that the statute should be interpreted more leniently and that Bates' actions, while technically in violation, did not align with the harmful outcomes the law sought to	1913	2000.8707

The illumination levels in various parts of the printing works have been carefully studied to ensure optimal visibility without excessive energy expenditure. For instance, the area around the printing machines, where precision and attention to detail are paramount, has been equipped with an illumination level that averages around 500 lux, with minimal variations to maintain a consistent environment conducive to high-quality print output. This contrasts with the general areas of the plant, which are maintained at a lower average of about 300 lux, providing sufficient light for safety and navigation without the need for the intense focus required by machine operators. In the composing room, where typesetters work with fine, detailed fonts and layouts, the illumination is slightly higher than in general areas, approximately 400 lux on average, to reduce eye strain and increase accuracy in typesetting. Special attention has been given to eliminate shadows and reduce glare, which can cause errors in typesetting and lead to increased fatigue among workers. Furthermore, the installation of task lighting at individual workstations allows for adjustments based on the specific needs of each worker or the particular task at hand. This flexibility not only enhances	1912	1979.1122
The differential equations of motion representing the forced vibration of an elastic system under, say, a harmonic or cosine periodic force, framed in terms of acceleration or of energy, together with its solution, bring out very clearly the nature and amplitude of the forced vibrations ; an idea of the modifying effects of friction may be obtained by including in the equation a term to represent the retarding force which increases with the velocity. 161. Longitudinal Vibrations. — The extreme cases of a rod carrying no load and a rod carrying a mass so large that its own inertia is negligible will be considered separately. Unloaded Rod. — In this case the frequencies are usually so great that synchronism with them is not likely to occur . in running machinery. If a rod of length / ^ 1 (Fig. 201) is fixed so as to prevent longi ^ 1 tudinal strain at one end, and free at the w other, the fixed end forms a node or stationary point; the remainder of the rod has a longi Fig.	tudinal antinode where the amplitude of vibration is greatest. The fundamental frequency of vibration of such a rod can be expressed by the formula \( f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}} \), where \( L \) is the length of the rod, \( E \) is the Young's modulus of the material, and \( \rho \) is the density of the material. This relationship shows that the frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the rod and directly proportional to the square root of the ratio of the Young's modulus to the density. This implies that materials with higher stiffness and lower density will have higher frequencies of longitudinal vibrations. Loaded Rod. — When a mass is attached to the end of the rod, the situation changes significantly. The added mass modifies the boundary condition at the free end, turning it into a loaded end. The frequency of vibration now depends not only on the properties of the rod but also on the mass of the load. The formula for the frequency of the fundamental mode in this case becomes \( f	1908	1957.3673
Arch. J own. 42. 313. Brit. Arch. Journ. 42. 313. ' e. g. the memorial cross of Cuthbert became a graveyard cross at Durham.	This transformation of the memorial cross into a more generalized symbol of sanctity and remembrance illustrates the evolving nature of ecclesiastical artifacts over time. It is not uncommon for objects initially intended for specific commemorative purposes to gradually acquire broader liturgical or cultural significance. The cross of Cuthbert, once a deeply personal tribute to a revered figure, now stands as a communal marker within the sacred confines of the graveyard, symbolizing a collective memory and reverence for the departed. Similarly, in other regions, we observe how architectural features or religious artifacts transition in function and meaning. For instance, in many medieval churches, what were once pagan symbols were repurposed into Christian iconography, reflecting both a continuity and a transformation of spiritual expression. This adaptive reuse within ecclesiastical contexts underscores the dynamic interplay between tradition and innovation in religious practice and memorialization. Such changes are not merely of historical interest but also provide insights into the ways religious communities negotiate their past and their cultural heritage.	1904	2007.4987
And without a sharp demarcation line this motor carefulness and thoroughness and persistence in speaking and choosing the subtle actions leads to the same characteristics in the retaining and forming of words and memory images and free ideas. We have seen sufficiently that their development is no less dependent upon motor processes. Needless to say that the more subtle these motor responses, the higher is the development of the volitional power. The strong football man, with all his energy for certain coarse responses, may have small intellectual energy. His attention has been focused on a narrow field and that has hindered the development of the will power for the finer and subtler elements. The great thinkers are seldom remarkable athletes. Everything depends on a skilful leading from the coarse actions to the refined ones, from the actions dealing with things to the actions dealing with ideas.	This progression requires a nuanced understanding of both physical and mental discipline. The interplay between the two is critical; as one develops the physical acuity through rigorous training, there is a simultaneous honing of mental sharpness and decision-making capabilities. The challenge lies in maintaining a balance where neither the physical nor the intellectual overwhelms the other, but rather they complement and enhance each other.  The education of the mind is not just about the accumulation of knowledge, but about cultivating the ability to apply that knowledge in varied, often unpredictable, real-world scenarios. Similarly, the training of the body is not merely about strength or endurance, but about learning to control and coordinate those physical capabilities with precision and efficiency.  In this light, the philosopher and the athlete are not as distinct as they might appear. Both require a mastery of technique, a commitment to continual improvement, and most importantly, the capacity to apply their skills under pressure. The philosopher's arena may be the debate hall or the written page, while the athlete's is the sports field, but both are arenas of intense competition and personal challenge.  	1909	1999.0135
"If there be any original contribution to the story it is in the elaboration of details, and in the speeches put into the mouths of the characters. One is significant enough for quotation: ' The few may be noted. In the Elene the element of perfume, which is dwelled upon by almost all, is omitted. It is 'a vapour like smoke' which reveals the hiding place of the crosses. In the homily it is 'the sweetest smell of all the most precious perfumes.' In the Old English Martyrology the brief paragraph under May 3d combines the smoke and the perfume. "" There came up a smoke of delightful smell from the ground where the cross was found."""	This variation in the sensory descriptions across texts not only highlights the subjective nature of interpretation but also the evolving nature of storytelling in medieval literature. Each author, or translator, brings forward elements that they believe will resonate most with their audience or perhaps align more closely with their own theological or aesthetic sensibilities. The transformation from smoke to a blend of smoke and perfume, and then to an explicitly pleasant perfume, could be seen as an attempt to enhance the miraculous nature of the discovery of the cross, making it not only a visual but also an olfactory miracle. Further, these alterations in the narrative detail might reflect broader shifts in the cultural and religious landscape, where the sensory experiences associated with the divine become more elaborate and refined. This progression could be tied to the increasing importance of relics and their associated miracles in the religious practices of the time, emphasizing the sensory as a bridge between the divine and the earthly. In literary terms, such embellishments serve to deepen the narrative, providing layers of meaning and sensory engagement that pull the reader—or listener—more fully into the experience of the story.

Transverse Vibration of Rotating Shafts. — A rotating shaft, when laterally disturbed, has its elastic righting forces reduced by the centrifugal force arising from its own inertia, hence its stiffness and frequency of transverse vibration are reduced, and its period increased. P Let the natural frequency of the shaft when not rotating be , and 27T  P' when rotating with angular velocity u be — . Then, from the equation 27T (3) of Art. 163, allowing for the centrifugal force as in (2), Art. 164 — dx - y =0 J) hence the vibrations are of the type in Art. 163, and /! + o = f (2) or, * = (3) the frequency being — » = ~ * (4) 1 27T and the time of vibration — T = vrb (5) We have seen in the previous article that the whirling speed is attained when u, = p; for a forced transverse vibration resulting from any periodic disturbance, apart from rotation, the critical frequency is that given by (4).	Therefore, the stability of the shaft during rotation is crucially dependent on the relationship between its natural frequency and the frequency of any external disturbances. If the frequency of these disturbances approaches the natural frequency of the shaft, resonance can occur, leading to excessive vibrations and potential mechanical failure. This phenomenon, known as critical speed, must be carefully managed, especially in high-speed applications such as turbines, compressors, and automotive drivetrains. To further analyze the behavior of the shaft under rotating conditions, we can consider the influence of damping. Damping forces, which are typically viscous in nature, act to reduce the amplitude of vibrations and can significantly affect the stability of the system. The damping coefficient, denoted as \( c \), modifies the vibration equation to include a damping term: \[ \ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_n\dot{x} + \omega_n^2x = 0 \] where \( \zeta \) is the damping ratio and \( \omega_n \) is the natural frequency of the system. The presence of damping alters	1908	1988.5935
These learned counsel did not sign their brief as attorneys for , — , etc. ; but in 1895 Mr. Choate, Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Morawetz, for fees paid by those who stood to pay large income taxes, had secured from the United States Supreme Court a decision that the income tax law of 1894 was unconstitutional. The purpose of the present amendment is to get around the decision of 1895. These public-spirited citizens foresee dire consequences if the constitutional status existing before 1895 should be restored and Congress should be permitted to tax incomes from the country's immense accumulations of property without apportioning the tax among the states according to population. To unapportioned taxes on the comparatively small incomes from wages, trades or vocations, they see no objection; and the  26 Supreme Court did not decide that such income taxes would be unconstitutional. The key to the situation lies in the fact that income taxes that can be levied only by apportionment among the states in the ratio of population, never will or can be levied at all; other income taxes may be levied.	This distinction, which may appear subtle, is pivotal in discussions concerning the power of taxation. The advocates for the amendment argue that by enabling Congress to impose a tax on incomes irrespective of apportionment, a more equitable distribution of tax burdens would be achieved. They point out that the wealthier segments of society typically derive a larger proportion of their income from investments and property, which under the pre-1895 system could escape taxation, shifting the burden disproportionately onto those with smaller, often labor-derived incomes. Detractors, however, warn of the dangers of granting Congress such broad taxing authority. They fear it could lead to unchecked fiscal power over individual wealth, which might be wielded without sufficient regard for economic consequences or individual rights. These concerns are not merely theoretical; they echo the debates that have historically surrounded the role of federal taxation and its impact on economic liberty and governance. As the debate continues, both sides marshal their arguments with historical examples and legal interpretations, hoping to sway public opinion and legislative action in their favor. The outcome of this constitutional amendment could fundamentally alter the landscape of American tax law,	1911	1994.0851

Cattle and sheep farming are also profitable ventures due to the extensive pastures. Additionally, the proximity to major markets allows for relatively easy distribution of agricultural products, enhancing the potential profitability of farming endeavors in Umatilla.

"The experiment is a failure, and labour has not been and never will be requited with its legitimate proportion of the revenue of the vicious system. ""It is absurd to say 'instruct yourself to a man who is working for his daily bread fourteen to sixteen hours a day, or to tell him to love who sees nothing around him but the cold calculations of the speculator and the tyranny of the capitalist legislator. Hence, the social question is inevitably grafted on the political question. They can be separated only by'destroying both."" — Mazzini."	This idea, expressed so fervently by Mazzini, underlines the intrinsic connection between the plight of the working class and the broader political structures that govern society. The laborer, burdened by exhaustive hours and meager pay, is scarcely left with the bandwidth or resources to pursue education or cultivate personal happiness. This oppression is not merely an economic issue but a deeply political one, as the mechanisms that sustain such disparities are embedded within the legislative frameworks crafted by those in power. The capitalist system, as critiqued by Mazzini, prioritizes profit over people, reducing human beings to mere cogs in a vast machine. This dehumanization is a direct result of policies that favor capital accumulation at the top, often at the expense of fair wages and humane working conditions for those at the bottom. The relentless pursuit of profit marginalizes the worker, making any notion of self-improvement or emotional fulfillment seem unattainable. Therefore, addressing the grievances of the working class requires a dual approach: reforming the economic systems that exploit their labor and overhauling the political structures that	1911	1998.2899

How had it come to this, that a great empire was caught so off-guard? In town halls, in pubs, and around dinner tables, the discussions were fervent and sometimes heated. ""We should have listened to Roberts!"" became a common refrain among those who felt the sting of unpreparedness most acutely.

Her mouth was sad, her chin quivered. Her long lashes were dewy with tears; her brow was the epitaph of grief; only her nose was keen, upstanding, alert, like an enterprising undertaker at a funeral. She carried a small, oddly shaped sample pase in Jier blaok gloved hand. zus She csmie suddenly into view from around the corner nearest the railroad station, and moved slowly across the Square, with the sorrowful mien of the chief mourner accompanying the body of her dear dead. The men stared.	"Their curiosity and confusion mingled as they watched this figure of melancholy grace glide through the town square. Each man, caught in his own daily concerns and trivialities, felt a sudden and unaccountable pull at his heartstrings. The sight of such profound sorrow parading so publicly and yet so alone struck a chord of empathy they could scarcely understand. As she passed by, the whispers began to ripple through the crowd, each person conjecturing her story. ""Whose widow could she be?"" one asked. ""What tragedy has befallen this poor soul?"" murmured another. The men, feeling both drawn to and repelled by her grief, found themselves unable to look away. Unbeknownst to them, this woman, Mrs. Eliza Whitcomb, had arrived not as the bearer of tragedy but as its herald. She was in town not to mourn a lost spouse but to finalize the affairs of a distant cousin whose estate had unexpectedly fallen to her. The black attire, though fitting for her task, was more a reflection of her personal preference than of any recent bereav"	1913	1935.3955
Ill THE quality which places Garrick above all other actors is his astonishing versatility. From the very beginning of his career he played all parts with equal ease. Thus, in the course of his first season, he metamorphosed himself into characters so widely different as that dreadful minister of hell, Richard III. ; Sharp the wily, knavish valet, a younger brother of Sganarelle; Fondle wife the old Puritan banker, uxorious and jealous; Witwoud,3 the affected and ridiculous fop; and Bays the farcically conceited author. Yet more; in the same evening, after representing the age and weakness of tortured, maddened Lear, he became the young, stupid, vicious, country lout, Master Johnny in Gibber's schoolboy. What great actor would today dare assume disguises so diverse ? Our modern stage has, indeed, become so highly specialised that such Protean artists are looked upon with some disdain, and relegated to the music halls. It is true that in 1740 a similar remark might almost have been made; the chief actors of the time were usually masters in one style, or famous in two or three characters.	But Garrick, with his boundless energy and profound understanding of human nature, seemed to embody the very essence of each role he undertook, no matter how disparate. His ability to switch from the tragic to the comedic, from the regal to the ribald, not only showcased his exceptional talent but also his deep insight into the dramatic arts. He understood that the core of acting was the human condition itself, which knows no bounds of genre or type. Critics and audiences alike were captivated by Garrick's performances, which were marked not only by their versatility but by the sincerity and intensity he brought to each part. His Richard III was not just a villain; he was a palpable presence that haunted the stage, while his Fondlewife was not merely a caricature of jealousy but a poignant, if somewhat ludicrous, figure of pathos. This ability to humanize, to bring depth and nuance to every character, made his performances unforgettable. Moreover, Garrick's influence extended beyond his own performances. He was a reformer of the theatrical practices of his time, insisting on	1912	1977.6985
"Sir Louis Ford tells me they cannot possibly stave off going to the country longer than November. And, of course, this time I shall have not only the usual Liberal gang — I shall have Coryston to fight!"" ""I know. It's appalling!"" cried Marcia. "" Can'T we get him to go away ?"" Then she looked at her mother uneasily. ""I do wish, mother, you hadn't put that notice of Arthur's meeting into the Witness. Why, you didn't even ask him before you settled it all! Aren'T you afraid of his cutting up rough ?"" "" Not in the least! Arthur always expects me to settle those things for him. As soon as Coryston had taken that outrageous step, it was imperative that Arthur should speak in his own village. We can't have people's minds in doubt as to what he thinks of Glenwilliam, with an election only five months off. I have written to him, of course, fully — without a word of reply!"	"But he will understand. He knows perfectly well that if we don't take a strong line now, Coryston will sweep the ground from under us. He's far too clever and far too dangerous. The constituency has always been loyal, but with Coryston's new ideas, who knows how they might be swayed?"" Marcia paced the room, her anxiety palpable. ""But mother, Coryston's influence is not just about his ideas. People genuinely like him. They connect with him. What if this only makes Arthur look weak, or like he’s hiding behind your decisions?"" Lady Ford waved a dismissive hand. ""Nonsense, Marcia. It’s not about liking; it’s about leading. Arthur will show them that he is the true leader, capable of making the tough decisions. And as for hiding—no one who knows the Fords would ever think that. We are a family of action."" She paused, her gaze firm and resolute. ""Besides, it's high time Arthur took a firmer hand in managing his own constituency. This will"	1913	2003.1569
In the sense that their numbers were more concentrated, owing to the limitation of moisture — a prime necessity in the life of a fly — this is probably true. It may be of interest to consider some statistics, showing to what enormous numbers the descendants of one fly may reach in the course of a summer. As most of you are aware, the eggs of a house fly hatch in from approximately six to twelve hours, and the maggots issuing therefrom reach their full size in from four to seven days. The outer layers of their body then harden and turn brown, forming the puparium, while the parts within become what is known as the pupa. The duration of the pupal stage is from five to seven days, at the expiration of which time the adult emerges as a perfect fly.	Given these rapid developmental stages, it is not difficult to comprehend the potential exponential growth in fly populations. Let us examine a hypothetical scenario: if a single female fly lays an average of 150 eggs per batch and can produce about 5 to 6 batches over the course of her lifetime, this results in approximately 750 to 900 eggs. Assuming a survival rate of 50%, which is conservative given the lack of predators in controlled environments, each female fly could potentially contribute 375 to 450 adult flies to the next generation. If each of these flies reproduces at a similar rate, the numbers could escalate dramatically. By the end of the second generation, one could observe anywhere from 140,625 to 202,500 flies stemming from a single progenitor, under ideal conditions. Continuing this model, the numbers become staggering as the generations progress, illustrating how fly populations can quickly get out of control, especially in environments conducive to their breeding and survival, such as areas with ample organic waste and warm temperatures. This rapid population growth underscores the importance of effective waste management and sanitation practices to control	1911	2007.1993
"In South America Darwin saw hills and mountains of pure quartz. Not far from Buenos Airs they formed tablelands, or mesas, without cleavage or stratification. On the Falkland Islands he found the hills of quartz and the valleys filled with ""streams of stone"" — . huge fragments of quartz rock, varying in size from a few feet in diameter ""to ten, or even more than twenty, times as much."""	These quartz formations, he observed, were often interspersed with other minerals, including feldspar and mica, suggesting a granitic origin. Darwin was particularly struck by the sheer scale of these geological features, which seemed to dominate the landscape, imposing in their starkness and uniformity. The mesas stood out against the skyline, their surfaces gleaming under the sun, reflecting light with an intensity that was almost blinding. The presence of these quartz mountains and mesas in such abundance raised questions about the geological processes that could have led to their formation. Darwin speculated that they might have been the result of immense volcanic activity, with molten quartz pushed up from deep within the earth, then cooled and solidified over millennia. Alternatively, they could have been remnants of ancient continental crust, exposed and worn down by erosion and weathering over vast periods. His observations in South America added to his growing body of evidence on the dynamic nature of the earth’s crust, suggesting a world that was far from static, continually shaped and reshaped by powerful and often cataclysmic forces. As Darwin	1913	1964.2739
The larger value (where the upper sign is taken) will be the stress intensity on such a plane as AB (Figs. 18 and 19), and will be of the same sign as A and A '> the smaller value, say will be that on such a plane as ED (Figs. 18 and 20) perpendicular to AB, and will be of opposite sign to /, and A lf T is greater than AA The planes on which there are maximum shear'stresses are inclined 450 to the principal planes found, and the maximum intensity of shear stress is (Art. 15) — = ar f AA = KA AT? The modifications necessary in (3) and (4), if A or p., is of negative sign, are obvious. If, say, as zero, the results from substituting this value in (3) and (4) are simple. This special case is of sufficient importance to be worth setting out briefly by itself in the next article instead of deducing from the more general case. 18. Principal Planes and Stresses when complementary shear stresses are accompanied by a normal stress on the plane of one shear stress.	When dealing with the scenario where complementary shear stresses are accompanied by a normal stress on the plane of one shear stress, certain adjustments in our approach are necessary. Consider the plane where the normal stress, \(\sigma\), acts, and let \(\tau\) represent the shear stress on this plane. The principal stresses in this case can be determined by solving the characteristic equation derived from the stress tensor: \[ \sigma' - \sigma = \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}\right)^2 + \tau^2} \] Here, \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_y\) are the normal stresses on the principal planes, typically perpendicular to each other, and \(\tau\) is the shear stress present. The terms inside the square root account for the combined effect of the differential normal stress and the shear. The principal stresses, represented by \(\sigma'\), are the roots of this equation, indicating the maximum and minimum normal stresses that occur on the principal planes	1908	1990.1674
Half a dozen hours later she would no doubt have been maimed for life. While I was in the Cape Smythe village I never saw the man who had abandoned his sister and her husband to starve and freeze, but it happened a month or two later that my party was storm bound on the southeast corner of Smith Bay, at the house of an old acquaintance of ours named Kunagrak, who was related to all the people concerned. The man who had done the abandoning happened to be staying with Kunagrak. I noticed that when we sat down to meals it was he who said grace; in spiritual matters he seemed to be an authority and the leading light of the place.	"His demeanor was pious and solemn, but I could not shake off the discomfort of knowing his recent history. It was a stark contrast to the respect he commanded among the villagers. During our stay, I occasionally caught him in quiet moments, staring out at the icy expanse, his expression unreadable. Perhaps he was contemplating his actions, or maybe he was simply lost in the vastness of the Arctic landscape. One evening, as the wind howled outside and the small wooden house creaked under the strain, I decided to confront him. We were alone, the only sound the crackling of the fire and the occasional shift of logs. I asked him directly about his decision to leave his sister and her husband, his eyes briefly flickered with something dark before he composed himself. He spoke softly, his words careful. ""In our land, survival dictates hard choices. The spirits guide us, and sometimes, they guide us to do things that are difficult to understand for those not of this place."" His explanation was steeped in a fatalistic view, one that did not excuse his actions"	1913	1996.2545
Already in the early part of   February 1264, the perpetual border fighting on the Welsh marches was made a pretext  ( /'/^  Kings March Barons  for the seizure by the party of De Montfort of certain Royal castles in the west. Henry came back from France (where he had   attended the Court of Arbitration) upon the 15th of February, to find himself face to face with an enemy already in the field. The strategical elements of this new struggle were as follows : The Cinque Ports with their castles — that is all the southern entries into England by which the approach from the Continent could be made upon London — were with Simon, and London, of course, was still very strong in support of him. Rochester, the great castle breaking the road between Dover and London, was, however, garrisoned by Royal troops; so was the line of strongholds upon the Thames.	This geographical advantage allowed Henry a vital foothold to potentially counter Simon de Montfort's influence and movements. Windsor, Oxford, and Wallingford were also held by the King's forces, forming a defensive triangle around London and securing the western approach. This strategic positioning was crucial, as control over these points meant maintaining supply lines and communication routes, essential for any prolonged conflict. Simon de Montfort, aware of the importance of these locations, planned to isolate London by capturing key points along the Thames and disrupting the King’s control over the surrounding regions. His forces, bolstered by the support of the Cinque Ports, provided him with a formidable naval capability, allowing for rapid movement and the ability to launch surprise attacks along the river. The barons’ strategy was further complicated by the internal divisions within their ranks. While many were committed to De Montfort’s cause, others were hesitant, fearing the potential consequences of a protracted war against the crown. This division was something Henry aimed to exploit, sending emissaries to negotiate with the more ambivalent among the barons, offering pardons and concessions	1912	1992.8016
"""A new system of vouch bills has been installed, permitting an almost absolute check on the accuracy of the expenditures of the city."" One payroll is used now, instead of the many separate ones. This secures unity and centralization. The city controller has responsibility and power over the whole expenditure. And as rapidly as possible all the departments of the municipality are being brought to one accounting system. The question of just taxation ""has been hindered by special interests and inadequate laws."" All property that is assessable under the existing laws can and will be placed on the tax books. Too much is still left to the judgement of the individual assessor. The administration finds that land values have in no wise been equitably assessed."	Adjustments are now being made to reflect more accurately the true market values. This reform is essential, not only for the sake of justice but also to ensure that the burden of taxation is evenly distributed among all property owners according to their real holdings. Moreover, the city is also exploring ways to enhance revenue through means other than direct taxation, such as leveraging municipal assets and optimizing service fees.  Efforts are being made to dismantle the entrenched systems that have allowed certain properties, particularly those owned by influential entities, to be undervalued historically. The new approach aims to close loopholes that have led to revenue loss and to create a more transparent and fair tax system. This shift requires a robust framework for property valuation, which is currently under development, and the integration of modern technological tools to assist in property assessment processes. In parallel, the city is also focusing on cost control measures. Waste and inefficiency are being targeted through comprehensive audits and the implementation of stricter financial controls. By centralizing financial operations and adopting a unified payroll system, the city expects to reduce administrative costs and prevent duplication of efforts across departments	1911	2000.087
And in this way, either by purchasing or refusing to purchase, our acquaintances grew many in Le Puy, and a mantle of fondness for the town wrapped us softly about, a fondness that gave us a spirit of elevation that yet had nothing to do with heights. The Young Lady and I continued humble in our pursuits, though not without a feeling of growing enrichment. That afternoon, the sun coming out, the Illustrator splashed through the narrow ways to St. Joseph's gigantic statue, the Photographer climbed to the thousand year old church of St. Michael's (achieving six doilies and three table clothes at the church door), and we sought the washerwomen who knelt on either side the narrow, rushing stream and thrust their poor, gnarled hands into the icy water for eighteen cents a day. We could see the statue crowned puys, built for the glory of God, from the little hollow where we sat, but I thought the cheery fortitude of these women to be quite as monumental.	"Their laughter rippled over the bubbling brook, blending with the sound of their vigorous scrubbing, as they exchanged tales and jests that echoed the resilience of their spirits. The Young Lady, usually so composed, was moved deeply by the scene, her eyes reflecting a mix of admiration and melancholy. ""See how they toil, yet their spirits remain undaunted,"" she whispered to me, her voice tinged with a reverence that the grandeur of St. Michael's had not elicited. We spent the better part of the hour there, watching and occasionally lending a hand with the heavier linens, feeling somehow that each wring and rinse drew us closer to the essence of Le Puy. It was in these simple, unguarded moments that the town revealed its true character to us, far removed from the grandiosity of its landmarks. The humble endurance and spirited camaraderie of the washerwomen painted a picture of a community knit tightly by the threads of everyday struggles and joys. As the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows over the cobblestones, we bid our"	1913	1936.108
He abandoned the siege and came westward to his father's aid, but made first, whether for recruitment or whatever other cause, for the family stronghold at Kenilworth. He lay there upon the 1st of August. His force was small and was but one of many which Simon had hoped would slowly converge to his aid upon the Severn Valley. The news that Simon's son thus lay at Kenilworth tempted Edward to one of the few strategic blunders of which he was guilty in the course of a long life of arms. He could not resist the temptation of capturing such a prisoner.	Thus, he diverted his main force, leaving only a smaller contingent to pursue the elder Simon's troops directly. Edward's decision to split his forces was a rare lapse in his otherwise astute military judgment. This move allowed Simon the opportunity to fortify his position, gather more supporters, and prepare for an extended conflict, rather than being caught in a swift, decisive battle which Edward had originally planned. On the morning of the 5th of August, Edward's troops approached Kenilworth, confident in their superior numbers and the element of surprise. However, they found the stronghold far better defended than anticipated. The fortifications had been strengthened, and the garrison was alert and ready. The initial assault was repelled with significant losses, and what was meant to be a quick capture turned into a protracted siege. Meanwhile, the elder Simon capitalized on Edward's distraction, rallying more forces to his side and maneuvering with greater freedom in the Severn Valley. He was able to disrupt supply lines and forge alliances, strengthening his position against the now divided royal army. Edward, realizing his miscal	1912	1926.9355
"There I saw that the Saxon gunners were all standing to their pieces, and one of my none too welcome guests accosted me as I left the house. "" ' If you'll take my advice, sare, you'll get away out of this he said in broken English. "" ' What! are you going to fire ? ' I asked. "" ' I don't fancy so. It wouldn't hurt you if we were. But I think your English friends from Colchester are about to see if they can draw us.' ""As he spoke I became aware of a sharp, hissing noise like a train letting off steam. It grew louder and nearer, passed over our heads, and was almost instantly followed by a terrible crash somewhere behind the house."	"The earth seemed to shake under our feet, and a cloud of dust and debris rose into the air, obscuring the sun momentarily. My heart raced as the realization hit me - the bombardment had begun. Panic gripped me momentarily, but the soldier's calm demeanor oddly reassured me. "" 'You'd best take cover, sir,' he advised, glancing skyward as another hissing sound heralded an incoming shell. I didn’t need to be told twice. I hurried back into the house, seeking the sturdiest part of the building that might offer some semblance of protection. Inside, the air was thick with tension. The servants were already huddled in the cellar, their faces pale and frightened. I joined them, trying to appear more composed than I felt. The ground vibrated with each explosion, a grim reminder of the chaos unfolding just beyond our temporary refuge. As the shelling continued, the intervals between impacts grew shorter. Each blast was a deafening roar that threatened to overwhelm our senses. Amidst the cacophony, I found myself reflecting on"	1906	1972.8645
"And the whole June day protested with him — its beauty, the clean radiance of the woods, the limpid flashing of the stream. He hurried on. Ah, there she was! — a fluttering vision through the new leafed trees. The wood was deep — spectators none. She came to his arms, and lightly clasped her own round his neck, hiding her face. . . . When they moved on together, hand in hand, Marcia, instinctively putting off what must be painful, spoke first of the domestic scene of the day before — of Arthur and her mother, and the revelation sprung upon them all. "" You remember how terrified I was — lest mother should know? And she's taken it so calmly!"""	"""Indeed, it's curious how life prepares us for its surprises,"" Harry responded, his voice a mix of wonder and relief. ""Perhaps it's not the shock itself, but the anticipation of it that wears on the soul."" Marcia nodded, her expression thoughtful as they meandered through the dappled sunlight. ""Yes, and to think I fretted over it for months. Mother, with all her quiet ways, has shown a strength I never credited her with. It's a lesson, isn't it? That sometimes, those we think we know best, can surprise us the most."" Harry squeezed her hand gently, affirming her insight. ""It's a lesson in trust, too. Trusting that the ones we love can handle more than we give them credit for. And perhaps,"" he paused, glancing down at Marcia with a tender smile, ""it's a reminder for us to be more open, to not carry our burdens alone."" Marcia returned his smile, feeling a weight lifting off her shoulders. ""Yes, Harry, that's exactly it."	1913	1976.382
"Do you understand?"" Susannah replied, slowly: "" I'D hate to play down there all the rest of the day. Dennis would go to sleep. He's only three, you know."" Philip experienced a sensation of resentment. "" Will you be good enough to tell me, "" he inquired, ""just what you mean by that?"" ""You'D never think to call us."" Susannah's voice was too level; it seemed to merely acknowledge a fact as it stood. It also made Philip mentally acknowledge it, which had the effect of arousing parental ire in him. "" Young lady, "" he asked, sternly, "" has it ever occurred to you children that you are old enough to mind? To just simply mind ?"""	"Susannah looked up at him, her eyes wide with the innocent candor of youth. ""Yes, sir,"" she replied softly, her voice tinged with a hint of confusion. ""But sometimes, it's just that we forget. We get to playing and everything else just slips away."" Philip's expression softened slightly, the harsh lines of frustration easing as he regarded his daughter. It was difficult, he knew, to balance the sternness of authority with the understanding of a father. ""I see,"" he said, more gently now. ""But you must try to remember, Susannah. It's important. You're not only looking after yourself, but Dennis too. He relies on you when I'm not around."" Susannah nodded, taking the admonition to heart. ""I'll do better, Daddy,"" she promised, a sincere determination in her young voice. Philip reached out, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear. ""That's all I ask,"" he said, a smile breaking through the residual sternness. ""Now, why don't you go and gather"	1913	1972.0612
This may be obtained by nearness to the market itself, or to shipping facilities where transportation to the market centres may be had at reasonable rates. Water communication is often better than rail, especially for those kinds of fruits that are easily injured by rough handling. Two or more competing lines of communication generally tend to give the shipper better service than when one road has the monopoly. Accessibility is of the first importance though it will not entirely take the place of suitable soil conditions; however, it may sometimes make it profitable to use an inferior soil. The distance which fruit can be hauled with safety or profit depends largely on the nature of the product itself.	For instance, delicate berries and soft fruits need to be handled with extreme care and cannot withstand long journeys without significant risk of spoilage. These types of fruits are best grown in locations that are very close to consumer markets or processing facilities. On the other hand, hardier fruits such as apples and pears can endure longer distances and rougher handling, making them more adaptable to areas where transportation may take longer. The type of transportation available also plays a critical role. For delicate fruits, refrigerated trucks or railcars can help extend the distance they can travel without deteriorating. This technology, however, adds to the cost, and the economics of using such methods must be carefully analyzed to ensure profitability. Moreover, the timing of shipments is crucial. Shipping during cooler periods of the day or season can reduce the risk of heat damage. Similarly, understanding and planning around market demand—avoiding times when the market is saturated and prices are low—can make a significant difference in the profitability of fruit farming. Ultimately, while proximity to markets and transportation options are critical, they must be balanced with the right cultivation	1914	2005.117

But, mind you, he never meant no harm by his tales. It was all in good jest.""

Sims chuckled, the memory of Leach's stories bringing a twinkle to his eyes. ""Oh, most definitely, sir. Bill's stories were like his whiskey—best enjoyed, not dissected."" ""Thank you, Mr. Sims.

235  CHAPTER XXI OUR FIRST VIEW OF THE EARTH FROM MARS — A MARTIAN COURTSHIP WITHIN a few days we had our first glimpse of the earth from Mars. It appeared only as a very thin but bright crescent of light, as the lighted portion was less than one twelfth part of the whole diameter of the disc, and it was only visible for a very short time. Owing to the clear and thin atmosphere of Mars there is very little scintillation of the stars, and the crescent form of the earth at such periods as the present can plainly be discerned without the aid of a glass. To the Martians this is more readily seen than by us, as their eyes, being larger than ours, have a much greater light grasp.	"As I stood beside my Martian guide, Zara, observing this celestial spectacle, she explained that to her people, Earth was known as ""The Blue Star."" It was revered and wrapped in countless myths and legends, some of which she shared with me under the dim glow of Earth's light. The Martians, she told me, once believed that their ancestors had traveled from Earth to Mars in ancient times, guided by the celestial patterns and a deep intuitive knowledge of the cosmos. The courtship rituals among Martians, as I learned over the following days, were deeply intertwined with their astronomical observations. During certain alignments, when Earth appeared as a bright crescent, Martian lovers would declare their intentions under the open sky, believing that the light from Earth blessed their unions with harmony and understanding. Zara invited me to witness such a ceremony, scheduled to coincide with the next appearance of Earth's crescent. At the chosen hour, the Martian landscape was bathed in a soft, eerie light, and the air was filled with a gentle hum—Martian instruments played by the gathered crowd. Two young"	1911	1999.4806
"In radiators for water cooling, the forms indicated as preferable from the present standpoint are the honeycomb or the flat tube type ; in either case the wind cutting and trailing edges of the tubes or water partitions should be ""faired "" to a streamline section. The whole question of the relationship of skin friction to the heat transmitting power of surfaces, is a matter of such importance that the author urges that the necessary wind channel experiments should be at once undertaken, either to establish or to refute the conclusions formed in the present contribution. These experiments might well include, (a) a series of determinations of the cooling capacity in winds of different velocity of streamline section fiat tubes, the determinations being made by the continuous cooling of a measured water flow, or of laminse heated electrically."	(b) investigations into the effect of varying the spacing and arrangement of tubes on the overall efficiency of heat transfer. It is also advisable to explore the influence of the surface finish of the tubes, as roughness or smoothness could significantly impact the rate of heat exchange and aerodynamic properties. (c) comparative tests between honeycomb and flat tube configurations under identical conditions to directly measure performance differences and understand the implications of each design on cooling effectiveness and pressure drop. These suggested experiments aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different radiator designs and configurations interact with airflow and heat transfer mechanisms. The outcomes could lead to optimized designs that enhance the performance of cooling systems in automotive and other industrial applications, ensuring they operate more efficiently and sustainably. By addressing these research gaps, engineers and designers will be better equipped to make informed decisions when developing or improving radiator systems.	1912	1996.808
"In fact, perhaps the most popular part of this extensive work is that in which he not only presents these entertaining stories but undertakes to explain them all on purely natural grounds. He found that before he could intelligently correlate these phenomena with the problem of after death existence, he must first learn whether they are caused, as some suppose, by invisible spirits, or whether their source lies in naturally discoverable forces. His conclusions are favourable to the latter theory; and to show how carefully he has worked out the hypothesis, he classifies all the phenomena, found in Lombroso's After Death, What? and explains how every one of them may have originated in forces recently discovered in the physical laboratories. This portion of the work is so novel and surprising that it will necessarily evoke much discussion and criticism. A hint of Mr. Frank's method may be found in the following paragraph: ""We had supposed that science had already learned the potency innate in matter, even in its ulterior phases, but suddenly she finds herself confronted by activities and manifestations of which but a few years ago she was totally ignorant."	It appears, therefore, that the boundaries of what is considered 'natural' are continually expanding as further discoveries are made. Mr. Frank suggests that many phenomena previously attributed to supernatural or spiritual causes might, in fact, find their explanation in these newly identified or poorly understood natural forces. He points out, for example, how electromagnetic fields, now well documented, were once unknown and could have been easily interpreted as ghostly apparitions or spiritual communications if encountered unexpectedly. In his analysis, Mr. Frank delves into cases of telekinesis and clairvoyance, providing explanations rooted in the effects of unrecognized energy fields on the human brain and nervous system, which are sensitive to such influences. He discusses the potential of the human mind to tap into these fields under certain conditions, suggesting that what many might call 'psychic' abilities could instead be a sophisticated form of interaction with the environment, mediated by natural laws yet to be fully understood. His approach is methodical and scientific, demanding rigorous evidence and dismissing anecdotal reports that cannot be reliably tested. This stance, while controversial among those who hold to	1911	1988.1884
"I noticed her at the door as we came in."" "" So did I, "" he replied. "" She is rather attractive, though a little — well, not quite fine enough, is she?"" "" Hardly, for a fastidious taste. But she's very good-looking, just the same, and she knows how to wear her clothes. The man does, too. Neither of them is just our sort, I imagine, but I like them because they look as if they enjoyed life. Such a contrast to those poor Tituses!"" The couple under discussion entered the vacant box adjoining the Dollivers', and exchanged pleasant, half smiling glances with their neighbours before sitting down. In the box on the other side of the newcomers, with a party of grown people, was a little girl about four years old, whose quaint speeches had been amusing everybody in the vicinity for some time, and presently, as a Bleriot rose in the air like a huge insect, she shrilled, excitedly: "" Look! Look!"	"See the big bird flying!"" Her small voice, filled with wonder and delight, captured the attention of those nearby, including the attractive couple. The man laughed softly, his eyes twinkling at the child's innocent excitement. ""It's quite the marvel, isn't it?"" he remarked to the woman beside him, who nodded, her eyes following the flight of the Bleriot with a mixture of admiration and amusement. The woman in the Dollivers' box leaned closer to her companion, whispering, ""It's lovely to see someone so enthralled by the simple joys of life. Makes one remember the beauty in the little things, doesn't it?"" ""Yes,"" he responded, his gaze shifting back to the couple. ""They do seem to find a genuine pleasure in their surroundings. It's refreshing, really."" As the aircraft continued its ascent, the little girl clapped her hands in glee, her laughter mingling with the murmur of the crowd. The couple smiled at each other, their expressions softening further. It was clear they were sharing in the child's joy,"	1913	1936.9912
As already pointed out this would by no means exclude many of those who would maintain that their own method was not scientific but philosophical. The fundamental questions of social life were for long studied mainly under the aegis of political philosophy and one of the first points which a modern sociologist, seeking to define his subject, has to consider is the relation of his method to this older discipline. He finds to begin with that systematic political thinking developed in close connexion with the general movement of metaphysics and moral philosophy. For this there is a double reason. On the one hand political philosophy whether in Hobbes or Locke, in Rousseau or Bentham, in John Mill or T. H. Green, closely resembles general philosophy in its method.	On the other hand, it deals with subjects—government, law, rights, obligations—that are deeply intertwined with ethical considerations, thus requiring a philosophical inquiry into what is just, fair, or beneficial. This philosophical backbone helps to frame political theory as not only a study of what is, but what ought to be, guiding the principles of governance and social organization. In contrast, modern sociology, while benefiting from the philosophical groundwork laid by political philosophy, diverges in its emphasis on empirical investigation and methodological rigor. It seeks to observe and document social phenomena as they are, rather than as they should be, employing techniques such as statistical analysis, case studies, and ethnography to gather data on social behaviors, structures, and institutions. This shift towards a more scientific approach does not diminish the value of philosophical insight but rather complements it by grounding theories in observable reality. Thus, the sociologist must navigate between these two realms, using the tools of empirical research to test and refine the theories derived from political and moral philosophy. By doing so, sociology not only enhances its own scientific rigor but also contributes to	1908	1997.4521
"His face and head were strikingly like Titian's, in the artist's portrait of himself, and the skull cap he invariably wore indoors, as well as a way he had of trimming his reddish brown beard, further bore out the resemblance and made us nickname him ""the only original living Titian."" He was deeply learned, a profound student of life as well as of art, simple as a child, exceedingly modest and almost always silent in a crowd; though he had a faculty of carrying on the most sparkling conversation under his breath, if only one or two people were listening, or, when sufficiently stirred, of contributing to the general discussion some quiet observation which embodied the very essence of wit or wisdom, as a sip of rare wine seems sometimes to contain in itself all the distilled fragrance of some famous vintage."	His rooms were a curious mixture of the ascetic and the artistic. Sparse furnishings mingled with an impressive array of books and paintings. The walls, lined with shelves, were laden with volumes on philosophy, history, and fine arts. Canvases, some his own work, others collected from his travels, adorned the remaining spaces. Each piece seemed to tell a story or hold a secret, much like the man himself. In his more private moments, he could be found either deeply engrossed in a book or lost in the act of painting, his brush strokes as thoughtful as his spoken words. Despite his quiet nature, there was an intensity to his focus, whether it be on a canvas or a conversation, that suggested a mind always at work, always weaving new connections between the seen and unseen aspects of the world. To those who knew him well, it was evident that his life was one of rich internal dialogues, a life where thoughts were as vivid and intricate as the images he painted. His ability to distill complex ideas into simple yet profound statements made him a revered figure in	1911	1930.4388
So that diluted solutions of the toxin not only constituted a remedy for the disease, but also a prophylaxis when administered in advance of infection. This was the first of the series of remedies known as anti toxins. Utilising these results in the study of diphtheria, the combined labours of Richet and Herico, Roux and Yersin, Klebs and Loeffler, eventuated in 1894 in complete mastery of this disease, whose investigation had been inaugurated by Pasteur a dozen years before. Prior to the antitoxin method of treatment, diphtheria had justly been regarded as one of the worst scourges of our race, claiming a death toll of 60 percent. of all cases, and frequently leaving the survivors seriously injured for the remainder of their lives. At present, the mortality is about four percent.	, and the quality of life for survivors has greatly improved. This drastic reduction in mortality and morbidity was achieved through the widespread use of diphtheria antitoxin, which neutralizes the toxin produced by the diphtheria bacterium, thereby preventing the severe complications that typically accompany the disease. This landmark discovery not only transformed the treatment of diphtheria but also laid the foundation for the development of other antitoxins and vaccines, further revolutionizing the field of infectious disease control. The success with diphtheria antitoxin spurred further research into the mechanisms of immunity and the development of vaccinations for other formidable diseases. Scientists, inspired by these breakthroughs, dedicated themselves to identifying the causative agents of diseases and their corresponding antitoxins or vaccines. The subsequent years saw the development of vaccines for tetanus, pertussis, and tuberculosis, each contributing to a significant decline in morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases. The introduction of these biological therapies marked a pivotal shift in medical practice from reactive treatment of diseases to proactive prevention, heralding a new	1911	2003.735
"If scientists have not always in view some practical end, they are more likely to be interested in those departments of knowledge which have a bearing on the immediate need of society. It will be observed, therefore, that this last influence, science for the sake of science, is not wholly separated from the preceding one, science for the sake of art, although a new motive is present. In addition to the need of solving an immediate problem, the value of all positive knowledge is recognised and becomes a new incentive in stimulating a study of the sciences. With this brief enumeration of the chief causes of the progress of science, we may turn to the consideration of the conditions under which the pursuit of science is most likely to flourish. It seems probable that science is somewhat more likely to advance, at least after a start has been made, in cold or in temperate climates, than in warm climates. According to Professor Cattell's ""Study of Eminent Men Prance has produced the largest number of scientists of any country, and England the next largest."	This observation may be attributed to various factors, including the intellectual environment, educational systems, and perhaps even the more demanding nature of life in such climates, which may drive individuals toward systematic inquiry and problem-solving. Historical access to resources and institutional support, as seen in the prolific academic and research institutions in these countries, also plays a crucial role. Moreover, the intellectual culture in these regions has often been marked by a vigorous exchange of ideas and a tradition of critical thinking, which are essential for scientific advancement. The establishment of learned societies and academies facilitated a community of scholars and thinkers who could collaborate and challenge each other's work, further enhancing the scientific output. In addition to climatic and cultural factors, political stability and economic prosperity are significant. These conditions allow for the funding of scientific research and the sustenance of long-term projects, which are often necessary for meaningful breakthroughs in science. Therefore, while the innate curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake are central to the advancement of science, the external conditions under which scientists work can greatly influence the pace and direction of scientific progress.

Air overlying regions where abundant water is available and transfer processes active becomes moistened to capacity; air overlying regions lacking water in any Figure 148. Moist and dry tongues of air. form whatsoever remains dry. Evaporation of surface water during the entire year and transpiration from plants during the growing season are the most important sources of atmospheric water. Over small areas falling precipitation can saturate an air layer, but this source does not compare in magnitude with evaporation from oceans, from wet soils and sands, and with transpiration. Extensive ocean surfaces in the subtropics • 319 •  makes this region the principal source of water vapour in the Northern Hemisphere, although the vegetation covered temperate zone ranks even higher during Summer. Polar and subpolar areas as well as the limited desert areas of North America definitely are not sources of moisture.	In these arid or cold regions, the air masses are characteristically dry, leading to a lower overall humidity and reduced precipitation. The interaction between these various air masses—moist and dry—plays a crucial role in determining weather patterns. As these air masses move and meet, they create boundaries known as fronts, which are often sites of significant meteorological activity including the formation of storms. When moist air from the tropics rises and encounters cooler temperatures at higher altitudes or latitudes, the water vapor condenses to form clouds and, eventually, precipitation. This process, known as advection, is a key mechanism in distributing moisture from wet regions to drier ones, thereby influencing global climate patterns. Additionally, the distribution of land and sea also affects the humidity levels of air masses. Land heats up and cools down more quickly than water. This differential heating contributes to the development of pressure systems and wind patterns that transport moist air across continents. Understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting weather and preparing for climate-related changes, especially in regions where water resources are critical and weather patterns are increasingly unpredictable due	1913	2003.6454
"Such a friendly critic close at hand would have made them realise the indecency of exploiting from their platforms the phraseology of the great lovers of the race and then retiring behind the scenes to carry on the meanest, sharpest, and most cynical of working organisations. He might even be able to restore to ""followers"" the understanding that, morally, in an organisation no member can rightly abandon responsibility for the spirit of the common bond. We hope he will extend his acquaintance with it. We do wish that suffragists would search their armoury of argument and find some reason why they want the vote for themselves."	It is not enough to echo the demands of the past or to cling to slogans that stir emotions without stirring thought. The call for suffrage must be rooted in clear, rational discourse that articulates the direct benefits and responsibilities it entails for women, and indeed for society as a whole. This requires a departure from merely sentimental appeals and a move towards a more reasoned and substantial engagement with the issues at hand. The suffragists need to articulate how the vote will serve as a tool for social and economic justice, how it will empower women to participate fully in the making of laws that affect their lives and the lives of their families, and how it will help balance the scales in a society that has too long held them in an unequal stance. They must demonstrate how political participation enriches not only the individual woman but enriches and strengthens the fabric of the democracy itself. Furthermore, it is essential that they address the counterarguments with respect and precision, not dismissing them out of hand, but engaging with them in a manner that is both respectful and enlightening. By fostering an environment of open dialogue, the	1911	2003.5564
"We should use every endeavour to prevent the feeling of anxiety as to our unpreparedness from cooling down. England's military hero, the man who had dragged us out of the South African muddle, had urged most strongly that a committee of the leading men of London should be formed to take the matter into their earnest consideration. The voice of London upon a question of such vital importance could not fail to carry great weight throughout the country. A "" citizen army, "" he had declared, was needed as well as the Regular Army. The only way by which a sufficient amount of training could be given — short of adopting the Continental practice — was by giving boys and youths such an amount of drill and practice in rifle shooting as was possible while they were at school, and by some system of universal training after they reached manhood. And that Lord Roberts had urged most strongly. Yet what had been done ?"	"Very little, it seemed. The proposals had been met with lukewarm responses, and the urgency of the situation was not fully grasped by the public. Committees were formed, indeed, and meetings held, but the progress was slow, hindered by bureaucracy and a lack of public enthusiasm. The notion of a ""citizen army"" was revolutionary, and while it garnered support from certain sectors, it faced opposition from others who feared the implications of such a militarization of society.  The need for a well-trained reserve force was clear, especially in light of the recent conflicts and the growing tensions in Europe. Yet, the execution was faltering. Lord Roberts' vision of integrating military training into the education system was innovative but controversial. Some argued it would distract from academic pursuits, while others saw it as essential for national security. The debate continued, with editorials in newspapers and discussions in Parliament. The urgency conveyed by Lord Roberts was echoed by a few, but the comprehensive implementation of his recommendations remained elusive. The challenge was not just logistical but cultural, requiring a shift in how the citizenry"	1906	1947.2728
Some additional tests of aeroplane fabrics were described in last year's Report. The initial tests applied to unused fabric consist in the determination of the weight per unit area; the tensile strength in warp and weft; the resistance to tearing; and the extension of the fabric corresponding to any given tension. In the last case the results are exhibited in the form of a stress strain diagram. The variation in behaviour from one specimen to another of the same material is of course considerable in fabrics, and a special procedure has to be adopted in preparing a stress strain diagram to obtain an average result which shall be truly typical of the fabric. These diagrams have been of great value, in connexion with inquiries into recent accidents, in calculating the stresses  21 to which the fabric may be subjected when in actual use on an aeroplane.	Further, the resistance to weathering, including the effects of moisture, sunlight, and temperature variations, is critically assessed. This involves exposing samples of the fabric to the elements for prolonged periods and then retesting them to measure any degradation in their physical properties. Tests for resistance to fuel and oil contamination are also conducted, given the proximity of the fabric to aircraft engines and fuel systems. Additional considerations include the fabric's susceptibility to mildew or fungal growth, particularly in humid environments, as well as its flammability and rate of burn, which are critical for ensuring safety in emergency situations. A flammability test is conducted by exposing the fabric to a controlled flame and measuring the time it takes for the fabric to ignite and the rate at which the fire spreads. The thorough analysis of these various characteristics helps in understanding the durability and life expectancy of the aeroplane fabric under different operational conditions. This information is crucial for manufacturers in selecting the most suitable fabric for different parts of the aircraft and for maintenance operations to determine when a fabric component must be replaced to ensure the aircraft's structural integrity and the safety of	1912	2004.9203

Still, two schools of thought do exist, both medical and lay : one which believes artificial restriction to be harmless, even beneficial; another which believes it to be harmful. Now all of us must, when experimenting, take risks, and we have the full right, in the interests of scientific investigation, to lay down our health or our lives, but until time has established which school is right, it seems to me we should not run the risk of hurting our bodies and 'minds in any way as long as there is a chance that \ve may transmit our weakened constitutions to others. 1 hope I have made it clear that I am not aggressively differing from Mr. Upton Sinclair. I am simply interested — ignorantly, but very sincerely — in every and any question touching the future of the race. It is a question which touches me as an actual mother, but still more in a world mother sense.	Both perspectives warrant consideration, for they spring from a common concern for the well-being of humanity, albeit approached from different angles. The cautious approach I advocate rests on the principle of 'first, do no harm,' a tenet held sacred in medical ethics. This principle becomes even more critical when considering not just individual well-being but the potential generational impacts of our choices.  The debate is not merely academic but touches on profound ethical considerations about our responsibilities to future generations. How do we balance the pursuit of knowledge and the potential benefits of such restrictions against the risk of unforeseen consequences? This is a question of stewardship, of ensuring that our explorations into improving human life do not inadvertently compromise the health and vitality of those who will come after us. As we navigate these complex issues, open dialogue remains crucial. We must engage experts from various fields—medical, ethical, and philosophical—to guide our decisions. Moreover, public education and involvement are essential to foster an informed community that understands the risks and benefits and can participate in the decision-making process. Only through collective deliberation can we hope to make	1911	2006.0652

"All over Europe wandering tendencies have been ascribed to their ghosts. In some countries the corpse of a suicide is supposed to make barren the earth with which it comes in contact, or to produce hailstorms or tempests or drought. At Lochbroom, in the Northwest of Scotland, the people believe that if the remains of a  self murderer be taken to any burying ground which is within sight of the sea or of cultivated land, this would prove disastrous both to fishing and agriculture, or, in the words of the people, would cause "" famine (or dearth) on sea and land ""; hence the custom has been to inter suicides in out of the way places among the lonely solitudes of the mountains."	"Similarly, in certain regions of Norway, it was customary to bury suicides at crossroads with a stake driven through their hearts, ostensibly to pin them to the earth and prevent their troubled spirits from wandering and causing havoc among the living. This practice, deeply rooted in local folklore, reflects a blend of fear and an attempt to maintain order within the community by setting strict boundaries between the world of the living and that of the dead. In other parts of Europe, particularly in rural Eastern Europe, ghosts of the deceased were believed to rise from their graves to lead nocturnal processions known as ""Wild Hunts."" These spectral gatherings were thought to foretell war, plague, or other disasters. To prevent such misfortunes, communities would engage in rituals that often involved the symbolic containment or redirection of these wandering spirits. The belief in the malevolent influence of the dead on the natural world underscores the interconnectedness seen between the spiritual and the physical realms in folklore. These practices not only served to protect the community from perceived supernatural threats but also reinforced social norms and values by prescribing specific, often elaborate burial rites for those"	1908	1996.1512
In dealing with it, we are not going to deny that we are insane. Too many wise people have been deemed insane for us to be unduly affronted. We do not deny that we seek to work alongside men, receiving equal pay for equal work. We do not deny that it is very easy for us to work alongside men, and we can express no opinions as to whether it is easy for men to work alongside women.	We assert, however, that the question of ease or difficulty in this matter should not dictate the principles of justice and equality. If the work is the same, the remuneration should be the same, irrespective of the gender of the worker. This is a simple assertion of fairness, one that underpins the very notion of a rational and equitable society. Furthermore, we do not deny that our demands for such equality may disrupt the traditional structures and expectations that have long governed the workplace. Indeed, we acknowledge that our stance might unsettle, might provoke, might challenge—but is not progress always a challenge to the status quo? We are prepared to bear the mantle of 'disruptors' if it means paving the way for a more just future. In the pursuit of this future, we seek not merely the reform of pay scales, but also the recognition of the equal capabilities and potential of women in all professional fields. We aim to dismantle the barriers, both overt and subtle, that have historically hindered women from achieving their full professional and personal potential. This is our mission, and we pursue it	1911	1994.0928
The skeleton is partly osseous, partly cartilaginous, the notochord persisting throughout life. There is a pair of vomerine teeth, and a pair each of large 6 to 7 pronged teeth, born by the palate and the mandible. There is a narrow gill opening on either side. The gills are free, but are not born by all the bronchial arches. Ceratodus is one of the very small group of fish which breathe air direct. The swimming bladder is converted into a large lung, which the animal uses regularly to reinforce the gills in respiration. Alone of its Order in Australia, its nearest allies are the Mud fish of East and West tropical Africa, and the Amazons.	The structure of Ceratodus presents a fascinating blend of primitive and more developed traits, making it a subject of considerable interest among paleontologists and evolutionary biologists. Its body is elongated and somewhat flattened, with a broad, horizontal tail fin that aids in propulsion through its aquatic habitat. The scales covering its body are large and heavy, providing protection without the flexibility seen in more advanced fishes. The lung-like structure of its swim bladder is particularly noteworthy. Unlike typical fish, which primarily rely on their gills for oxygenation of the blood, Ceratodus utilizes its swim bladder as a supplementary respiratory organ. This adaptation allows it to survive in oxygen-poor water environments, a trait it shares with its distant relatives, the lungfishes. This dual respiratory system is believed to be an evolutionary response to variable aquatic environments where oxygen levels may fluctuate significantly. The presence of vomerine and multi-pronged teeth suggests a diet that includes hard-shelled prey, which it can crush between its powerful jaws. This dietary capability indicates a versatile feeding strategy that may include both plants and small aquatic organisms	1909	2004.6989

The Taming of the Shrew, for instance, was so altered that the original robust banter and the fiery dynamics between Petruchio and Katharina were diluted to a mere shadow of Shakespeare's intent. Garrick introduced a softened, more sentimental Katharina and a less domineering Petruchio, which, while perhaps more palatable to the sensibilities of his contemporary audience, stripped the play of its vigorous exploration of contentious relationships and transformative love. Similarly, his rendition of A Midsummer Night's Dream was infused with excessive spectacle and musical interludes that, though visually impressive, detracted from the lyrical beauty and intricate weaving of the original plotlines. Characters were often overshadowed by the grandiose sets and elaborate costumes, turning the play into more of a visual feast than a narrative journey. While Garrick's intentions might have been to make these plays more accessible and engaging for his audiences, his heavy-handed alterations were criticized by purists who believed that the essence of Shakespeare's works was compromised. His approach was seen as pandering to the tastes of the time	1912	1993.8202

The photos were taken by my assistant, Mr. Kelly, who also made the slides for this paper, and I wish to FIG. 21.	acknowledge his excellent work in capturing the nuances of each setting. The accuracy in the representation of the lighting effects in these various rooms is indeed commendable. Each slide clearly demonstrated the impact of proper illumination on the ambiance and functionality of a room. For instance, the billiard room, with its focused overhead lighting, ensures that players can see the table without any shadows interfering with their game. Similarly, the drawing-room, with its softer, shaded lighting, creates a warm and inviting atmosphere suitable for social gatherings. In the study, the arrangement of the table standards, specifically designed for reading, highlights the importance of task-specific lighting. This is crucial not only for functionality but also for eye health, as proper lighting reduces strain. Mr. Kelly's photographs effectively showcased these practical applications, making it easier for the audience to appreciate the subtleties of lighting design. Furthermore, the inclusion of the lantern at the foot of the stairs in the townhouse serves as a perfect example of how lighting can also be used as a decorative element, enhancing the architectural features of a space while providing necessary illumination.

Yet nature provides the mind with well working safety valves. As soon as a certain limit is passed, attention fails, the will succumbs, and every additional effort is fruitless. Moreover, every overburdening interferes with the value of the work. If more is demanded than the child's mind can fulfil, the result is carelessness and superficiality. Then the poor result discourages the pupil and the discouragement inhibits all mental powers; thus a vicious circle is established. Surely, a wise limitation of the quantity of work is fundamental for the success of the school.	It is imperative that educators recognize the delicate balance required in nurturing the intellectual growth of the young without overwhelming their capacities. The curriculum must be structured in such a manner that it challenges students, yet remains within their cognitive reach. Lessons should be designed to progressively build on previously acquired knowledge, ensuring a steady, manageable ascent in learning, rather than abrupt or excessive demands that lead to mental exhaustion. Furthermore, ample opportunity for rest and recreation must be interwoven into the school day. These breaks are not merely pauses in learning but essential periods that facilitate the consolidation of information and the rejuvenation of the mind. They allow students to return to their studies refreshed and ready to absorb new material. In essence, the goal of educational institutions should be to foster a love of learning and a robust work ethic, achieved not through relentless toil but through a balanced approach that respects the psychological and physical limits of the student. This approach not only prevents the detrimental effects of overburdening but also enhances overall student engagement and retention of knowledge.	1909	2005.059
before death results. Carnegiea loses nearly 30 percent. before serious results follow, although the extremely succulent seedlings of this plant may shrink to one third the original weight and still live. Plants with a large water balance are especially characteristic of the arid regions of southwestern United States, Mexico, some parts of South America and South Africa. It is notable that the great deserts of central Asia and Asia Minor, as well as the whole of north Africa, have but few native species of this habit. Some succulent Euphorbias are reported from India, but information concerning the occurrence of plants with a large accumulation of water in Australia is very meagre. The physical causes which might be operative in inducing this habit in representatives of widely separated families are not known.	The theory, however, has been suggested that intense and prolonged periods of drought, coupled with extremely high temperatures, are likely to favor the development of such adaptations. These conditions would necessitate the evolution of mechanisms in plants that allow for the storage of substantial amounts of water. This storage capability would enable the plants to survive during extended periods without rainfall. Furthermore, the ability to quickly absorb large quantities of water during infrequent and brief rainfalls is also advantageous.  In addition to environmental pressures, the genetic predisposition of certain plant families to develop succulent characteristics cannot be overlooked. For instance, the Cactaceae family, predominant in arid regions of the Americas, is particularly well adapted to these environments. Their thick, fleshy tissues designed to store water, along with a reduced number of pores (stomata) for minimizing water loss, are critical for their survival in desert climates. Similarly, the leafless stems of many succulent plants reduce the surface area through which water can be lost, further conserving vital moisture. The waxy, thickened cuticles that cover the surfaces	1911	2005.6364
Von der Rudesheim, on his part, mindful of his instructions, determined to try to hold the few scattered houses on the north side of the heath which constituted the village, with the battalion already in it, and push forward with the remainder of his force towards Harlow. His first essay along the direct road via Sheering, was repulsed by the fire of the Scots Guards lining the copses about Gladwyns. He now began to have some idea of the British position, and made his preparations to assault it at daybreak. To this end he sent forward two of his batteries into Hatfield Heath, cautiously moved the rest of his force away to the left, arranged his battalions in the valley of the Pincey Brook ready for attacking Sheering and Gladwyns, placed one battalion in reserve at  296   Down Hall, and stationed his remaining battery near Newman's End.	As darkness enveloped the landscape, Von der Rudesheim's men worked silently, using the cover of night to their advantage. The low murmur of orders and the occasional clink of equipment were the only sounds that betrayed their movements. The general knew the importance of maintaining surprise and momentum in the impending assault. His scouts reported back that the British defenses appeared robust but not insurmountable, and he felt a cautious optimism about the coming battle. Throughout the night, small reconnaissance parties probed the British lines, gathering crucial intelligence on their fortifications and troop deployments. Von der Rudesheim pored over these reports, adjusting his strategy accordingly. He planned a multi-pronged attack; while the main force would engage directly at Sheering and Gladwyns, a smaller contingent would attempt to flank the British from the east, exploiting any weakness in their perimeter. As dawn approached, the air was tense with anticipation. The German artillerymen readied their guns, carefully aiming based on coordinates set during the night.

Water and oil are trapped at the ends of a rectangular box by removable walls. When the inner retaining walls are lifted, both the water and oil will rush toward the opposite end of the box. In Sketch 2, they are at the point of impact. Oil is less dense than water and as the two fluids continue to move to opposite ends of the box, the water will under run the oil. In the lower sketch the fluids are at rest, with the oil uniformly distributed above the water. The greater density of water compared to oil permits water to underrun oil when the two meet as illustrated.	This phenomenon is a classic example of the principles of fluid dynamics and density differences in action. As the water and oil move towards each other, their respective densities dictate their behavior upon meeting. Water, with a higher density, naturally seeks the lower level, pushing beneath the oil, which is lighter and therefore remains above the water. This stratification is further stabilized by the immiscibility of oil and water, which prevents them from mixing and maintains a clear boundary between the two layers. The dynamics of this system can be explored through the lens of hydrostatics as well. The pressure at any given depth in a fluid at rest is governed by the fluid's density and the gravitational force. In this case, the denser water exerts a higher pressure at every depth compared to the less dense oil, which is why it displaces the oil upwards when the two fluids come into contact. Moreover, this setup provides a visual demonstration of the concept of buoyancy, where the oil experiences a buoyant force due to the water, further contributing to its positioning above the water. This arrangement of oil floating on	1913	1994.2435
"We are surprised, for instance, to find that kaleidoscopic colours, such as result from a blow on the head, can be turned to account. And we could all have drawn higgledy piggledy if we only had the enterprise. GLADYS JONES. 999 THE STATUS OF MEN. To the Editor of THE FREEWO""AN. MADAM, — If not already forestalled by some nearer reader, perhaps there will be room in the next issue of THE FRKEWOMAN for this suggestion from an admiring American subscriber, namely, a possible common ground for Mr. Wells, the editor, and some of the vehement correspondents."	It strikes me that much of the discord arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of each other's positions, rather than from an intrinsic opposition in their views. Mr. Wells' recent articles, advocating for progressive changes in societal structures, seem to align more closely with the aspirations of many readers than might be initially apparent. Yet, the tone and certain presumptions perhaps grate on sensibilities attuned to a different frequency of discourse. What if a round-table discussion were to be organized, either in the pages of THE FREEWOMAN or in a public forum? Such a setting could provide a platform for clarifying intentions, dissecting disagreements, and exploring the nuances of each stance in a more collaborative environment. This could not only bridge gaps but enrich the conversation, drawing from the diverse perspectives that each party brings to the table. Sincerely, An Admirer from Across the Sea	1911	1983.3297
"His laugh seemed to give her physical pain. 931 ""Couldn'T you take to desiring something else, mother, than my 'good' as you call it? Because, I tell you plainly, it don't suit my book. You have been meddling in my affairs! — just as you have always meddled in them, for matter of that! But this time you've done it with a vengeance — you've done it damnably!"" He struck his hand upon a table near. ""What right had you"" — he approached her threateningly — ""what earthly right had you to go and see Enid Glenwilliam yesterday, just simply that you might spoil my chances with her! Who gave you leave!"" He flung the questions at her. ""I had every right, "" said Lady Coryston, calmly."	"Her voice held a steely resolve as she met her son's fiery gaze with unwavering composure. ""As your mother, it is not only my right but my duty to intervene when I see you heading towards disaster. Miss Glenwilliam, with all her charms, is not suited for you, Arthur. She does not share your values, nor does she understand the responsibilities that come with your position. You may not see it now, blinded as you are by infatuation, but I acted out of concern for your future."" Arthur's face reddened, his anger still simmering just below the surface. ""You presume too much on the name of 'duty,'"" he retorted sharply. ""You mask your meddlings under the guise of maternal concern, but what you truly seek is control. Control over me, over my choices. This isn't about suitability or duty; it's about power."" Lady Coryston's expression hardened, her eyes narrowing slightly. ""Do not mistake my intentions, Arthur. I have no desire to control you. My actions, however"	1913	1951.2733
Now the men of this valley find that it is quite out of the question to make or maintain an equal division of the farm land. Even if it were feasible to secure to each man the same amount of land, these equal shares could not have the same quality of soil nor be equally favoured as to location. Moreover, if these opportunities could possibly be equalised by a gerrymander of the territory, the equality would be immediately upset by social changes. But these farmers discover that the price of land is the measure of the advantage that the farmer on that land has over the farmer who has no farm.	Thus, they are led to a curious conclusion: that the true equality lies not in the division of the land itself, but rather in the value that each parcel of land represents. With this understanding, they begin to contemplate a system wherein this value could be shared or redistributed, not through the physical redistribution of the land, but through economic measures that reflect the inherent value of each parcel. As the discussions evolve, they consider the implementation of a land value tax, a proposal that taxes the value of the land itself, irrespective of the improvements made upon it. This method, they reason, would not only encourage the efficient use of land but also ensure that the benefits derived from its location and natural advantages are shared among all members of the community. This tax would be a means to capture the unearned increment that accrues to landowners simply because of external factors such as the community's overall development and progress, which they themselves might not have contributed to. In this way, the men of the valley come to see that while the land cannot be equally distributed without causing significant disruption and inefficiency, the economic	1911	1972.0024
It was far away in every sense. Nearly three thousand miles from the western boundary of what was then the United States; almost a terra incognita; the Columbia River discovered but a century before; an untracked wilderness of plain, forest, mountain heights and gorges, canyons, quicksanded rivers and bad lands to cross before it could be reached; most of the country overrun with wild and savage Indian tribes who regarded special areas as their own particular hunting and living grounds, upon which none might trespass save at peril of their lives — it was really a lar away land.	The challenge it presented was immense, yet it was precisely this formidable nature that called to the brave and the adventurous. Men of daring, traders, trappers, and explorers were drawn to its mystery and promise of new beginnings. The lure of the unexplored and the potential for finding routes for trade and new settlements led many to risk the journey despite the dangers. Among these was the well-known expedition led by Lewis and Clark, who, under the commission of President Thomas Jefferson, undertook the arduous journey to map the vast territory and establish the American presence. Their journals provided the first detailed accounts of the region, opening up the West to the imagination and ambition of the nation. Following the path forged by these early explorers, pioneers began to envision a life in this distant land. The Oregon Trail, marked out by fur traders and early pathfinders, soon became a well-trodden route. Conestoga wagons filled with families and all their possessions made the perilous trek across mountains and prairies, driven by stories of fertile farmland and a better life. 	1911	1921.1278
"Take it. You must pin it on yourself; it is the rule. Take it, I tell you."" Under the compulsion of his eyes and voice, Von Marx received it in his open hand. He was aghast; the thing he had intended to prevent was happening in spite of him. "" I must speak, "" he cried, suddenly. "" I will speak. This star — I can't — "" The general interrupted him in his harshest voice. He looked across at his officers. "" Then, "" he said, "" in that case you will wait for me below, gentlemen."" 362 The door closed behind them, their spurred boots were noisy on the stairs, and Von Marx was alone with the general. The Iron Star lay yet in his hand; with a shudder he dropped it on the counterpane. The general, watching him with pursed lips, nodded to himself. ""Well, "" he said. ""You want to tell me what you were doing when the straw yard was fired, eh?"	"Von Marx hesitated, his face pale and drawn. He knew the gravity of the accusation that could be laid at his feet, and the star in his hand felt heavier than lead. ""Yes, General,"" he finally managed, his voice a strained whisper. ""I was there, but not for the reasons you think."" The general's eyes narrowed, his gaze sharp and calculating. ""Explain yourself, then. Quickly, man. I have little patience for dawdling."" Gathering his courage, Von Marx straightened his shoulders. ""I was investigating, sir. There had been rumors, whispers among the men about a possible sabotage. I went to see for myself, to prevent any harm."" ""And yet, the straw yard still burned,"" the general retorted coldly. ""Yes, sir, it did. But it was already alight when I arrived. I tried to control the flames, to save what I could. I was not the instigator."" The general paced slowly, his hands clasped behind his back. ""And why should I believe you, Von Marx?"	1913	1957.6913

This arm, in the case of uniform distribution, would be \( \frac{t}{2} \), thus simplifying the calculation for practical engineering applications.  It is crucial to note that the analysis assumes a linear elastic behavior of the material comprising the plate, and the stresses developed must not exceed the yield strength of the material to avoid any permanent deformation or failure. The bending stress also varies linearly from the neutral axis, reaching a maximum at the outer fibers where \( y = \pm \frac{t}{2} \). Further, if the plate were subjected to additional external loads or constraints, these would need to be incorporated into the model. For instance, if there were temperature gradients across the thickness, thermal stresses would also need to be considered, potentially complicating the analysis significantly. To validate these theoretical predictions, one could conduct experimental tests on a physical model of the structure or use finite element analysis (FEA) software for a more detailed and nuanced study. These methods would help in understanding the actual behavior under various loading and boundary conditions and in identifying any critical stress concentrations	1908	1984.682
At no spot south of the Thames, except perhaps the reconnoitring parties who crossed at Egham, Thorpe, and Weybridge, and recrossed each night, were there any Germans. The ground was so vast and the population so great, that Von Kronhelm feared to spread out his troops over too great an area. The Saxons had orders simply to keep Lord Byfield in check, and see that lie did not cross the river. Thus it became for the time a drawn game. The Germans held the north of the Thames, while the British were continually threatening and making demonstrations from the south.	The situation was one of tense equilibrium, each side watching the other with hawk-like vigilance, neither daring to make a decisive move that could turn the precarious balance into a rout. Lord Byfield, aware of his precarious position yet unwilling to retreat, maintained a defensive stance, fortifying his positions along the southern banks and sending out frequent patrols to monitor the movements of the Saxons. His scouts reported back tirelessly, their eyes sharp for any sign of weakness or opportunity in the German lines. Von Kronhelm, on the other hand, was equally cautious. His strategy was containment, ensuring that the British forces remained south of the river without engaging in a full-scale battle that could potentially stretch his forces too thin. He ordered his men to construct temporary fortifications and maintain a constant state of readiness, knowing that the slightest error could give Lord Byfield the opening he needed. The local populations, caught in the middle of these military maneuvers, found their daily lives disrupted by the constant presence of soldiers and the ever-present threat of conflict. The roads were often blocked, and fields trampled by the march	1906	1972.3876
"Still smiling at me, the Colonel took his hat and went out. He walked in the direction of the village, intending, I suppose, to collect more facts. I wondered whether he would find out that Fulking tonne's brown dog was at home in its kennel on Monday afternoon. After watching him off the premises, I went to look for my wife. I found her very busy over the bodice of a dress which she had not worn for a long time. She explained to me that it was absolutely necessary to make some alterations in the garment in order to meet the requirements of the present fashion. She intended to wear it that night at the Fulkingtons' dinner party. ""I can't go, "" she said, ""in the same gown that I wore last night."" "" It's very doubtful, "" I said, "" whether you'll go to the Fulkingtons' at all."" "" What on earth do you mean ? We'Ve promised to go."""	"""But,"" I continued, ""if the Colonel is stirring up the village with his inquiries, it's possible that something might come up that would prevent us from attending."" My wife paused in her sewing, looking up at me with a mixture of annoyance and curiosity. ""Do you really think it's that serious? What could possibly happen that would keep us from a simple dinner party?"" I shrugged, feeling slightly uneasy about sharing my suspicions. ""I'm not entirely sure, but the Colonel seemed quite intent on uncovering something. If he stirs up enough trouble or digs up something scandalous, it might not be suitable for us to be socializing at the Fulkingtons'."" She sighed, threading her needle with fresh thread. ""Well, I suppose we will just have to wait and see. In the meantime, I intend to have this dress ready. One must always be prepared, after all."" Resuming her alterations, she added thoughtfully, ""Perhaps it's all a storm in a teacup, but I do wish the Colonel would leave well enough alone. His investigations"	1913	1963.0548
He is entitled to speak from the accepted facts of the science.’ Physicians have been permitted to give knowledge and opinions confessedly not from their own observation and experience, but merely from reading and studying medical authorities.‘ When books are referred to for authority, or to strengthen opinions, the opposition may bring the same books in evidence to test the Witness’s knowledge, or to contradict him or his opinion.‘ Rules for the construction of cuts and embankments, given by an engineer, and though acknowledged to have been given solely from his recollections of what he had read in Mahan, Gillespie, Gilmore, and other authorities on engineering, were received as competent.‘ It is therefore submitted that though books themselves are not admissible to prove the declarations they contain, yet their statements and opinions may be brought to the court and jury through the mouths of skilled witnesses. The expert engineer should, to that end, seek, collect, and prepare the opinions of learned authors to sustain his position and carry conviction to the minds of court and jury.	This practice, while it enriches the discourse with a breadth of knowledge, also places a significant responsibility on the expert witness to accurately represent and interpret the authoritative texts. The expert's credibility is thus deeply intertwined with his or her ability to critically engage with and convey the established literature. In cases where the expert may not have direct experience or observation, these scholarly references become the scaffolding upon which their testimony is built.  It is crucial, therefore, that the expert not only be well-versed in the relevant literature but also maintain an objective stance, carefully distinguishing between widely accepted theories and those that are more contentious or speculative. This scholarly grounding not only enhances the reliability of the testimony but also ensures that the court is guided by the most current and rigorous scientific understanding. Moreover, the ability to effectively critique and counter opposing expert opinions using the same sources or alternative authoritative texts is a valuable skill, enabling the expert to address and potentially neutralize challenges to his or her testimony. In this context, the expert acts as both a conduit and a filter, bringing the weight of scientific community consensus into the courtroom,	1913	1984.517
A broad approach to the new State Capitol is proposed, opening into a formal water front, while a central avenue is designed to connect the university and state buildings, much as has been done in the cities of Europe. Probably the most complete, certainly the most courageous, plans of city rebuilding yet undertaken by any city are those prepared for the city of Chicago by Daniel II. Burnham under the inspiration of the Commercial Club. The plans involve an estimated expenditure of $250,000,000; their preparation alone cost $75,000, which was contributed by persons interested in the project.	The comprehensive scheme proposed by Burnham, known as the Plan of Chicago, aims to dramatically reshape the city’s layout and aesthetics. It includes the development of an extensive park system, the creation of new boulevards and streets, and significant improvements to the lakefront. Central to the plan is the development of a series of concentric roads and a rectangular grid system to enhance traffic flow and accessibility. Furthermore, the plan places a strong emphasis on beautification, proposing monumental architecture along the principal routes and at key focal points to create visually appealing vistas. Burnham’s vision extends to the improvement of rail and harbor facilities, crucial for bolstering Chicago’s role as a major commercial hub. The plan also addresses public welfare with the provision for more open spaces, parks, and playgrounds to ensure a healthier environment for the city’s residents. Educational and cultural institutions are not overlooked; the plan suggests their strategic placement to foster a more enlightened community. In essence, the Plan of Chicago is not merely an ambitious urban design project but a bold social vision, aiming to combine functionality with grandeur, thereby transforming Chicago	1913	2003.6454
For this reason a temporary balance of much lighter construction was fitted up on the top of the channel, and the wires were suspended in the centre of the channel from a spindle passing through the roof. On this balance wires of j5 inch and '038 inch diameter were tested. The test on the 1 inch wire was repeated several times on the channel balance, and the values are plotted in the • diagram (Fig. 34 opposite). The final results arrived at are shown in Fig. 34, where K, the force in lbs. 'per foot run divided by £>»*, is plotted against Dv, the product of the diameter • of the wire and the velocity of the wind.	The graph illustrates a clear linear relationship between the force exerted per foot of wire and the product of the wire's diameter and wind velocity. This finding is significant as it suggests that the wind load on the wire can be predicted accurately based on these two parameters, which is crucial for the design and safety of aerial cables and similar structures. Further analysis of the data shows that the force increases proportionally with an increase in either the diameter of the wire or the velocity of the wind. This proportional increase is expected due to the greater surface area exposed to the wind and the increased energy of the wind at higher velocities. The coefficient K, derived from the slope of the line in Fig. 34, provides a practical measure for engineers and designers to calculate the expected wind load under various conditions. This coefficient can be applied universally across different wire sizes and wind speeds, simplifying the process of engineering calculations. Moreover, the repeatability of the test results, as indicated by the multiple tests conducted on the 1 inch wire, confirms the reliability of the experimental setup and the consistency of the measured forces.

When Mrs. O'Donovan died he mourned her with sorrow so sincere that her bereaved old husband felt him to be the one link which still bound him to life, and seven years later, when old Timothy himself passed away in the arms of his faithful servitor, it was found that he had left the farm and house to the wanderer who, twelve years before, haggard and nameless, had stumbled desperately up his garden path. The new farmer was not long to lead a solitary life. A great nephew of O'Dono van's, a boy of fourteen, left orphaned in Ireland before his uncle's death, had already started out to the States, and four or five days after the funeral he arrived at the house, horribly frightened at everything so strange and different, horribly homesick, horribly alone, and more than willing to accept the instantly offered home thrown open to him by his uncle's successor, whom he thought his own blood relative. When he had recovered from his first panic he proved himself very useful to the solitary man.	He quickly adapted to the rhythms of farm life, learning to milk the cows, tend the sheep, and manage the horses with a surprising adeptness for a boy his age. The new farmer, who had found in the boy not only a helper but a kindred spirit of sorts, taught him everything from plowing fields to repairing fences, passing on knowledge that had been generously shared with him by old Timothy. As the seasons changed, the bond between them grew. The boy, whose name was Seamus, brought a fresh spark of life to the farm that had been missing since the O'Donovans' passing. His laughter echoed through the fields, and his tireless curiosity about the natural world around them rekindled the farmer's own appreciation for the land he now tended. Together, they expanded the farm, adding a vegetable garden that Seamus took particular pride in. He learned to rotate crops, to compost, and to battle pests with natural remedies. The local market soon began to anticipate their produce, and their stall became a popular fixture. In the evenings, the pair often sat	1913	1963.1703
That letter was probably intercepted. At any rate Henry marched out with a quite insufficient body of some 2000 men up the Edgware Road. Somerset was with him. In a skirmish of perhaps half an hour, York had forced the streets of the little town, killed Somerset and a handful of others, and captured the person of the King himself, whom he found in a tanner's house wounded in the neck by an arrow. After that success York continued his march upon London, bearing the King with him, and after negotiations which do not concern us was again Protector of the Realm, with Salisbury as Chancellor and Warwick as governor of Calais. The importance of that second appointment will soon be seen.	"Warwick, already known as the ""Kingmaker,"" was a figure of immense influence and strategic prowess. His control over Calais not only provided him with a critical military and naval base but also a gateway for diplomatic and trade relations between England and the Continent. This position would allow him to wield considerable power in both domestic and international spheres, strengthening York's position in the ongoing struggle for the English throne. The political landscape was tumultuous, with allegiances shifting like sand. The capture of King Henry VI marked a significant turning point, as it left the Lancastrian cause without its figurehead, sowing confusion and demoralization among its adherents. However, the Queen, Margaret of Anjou, was far from defeated. Fierce and determined, she began to rally supporters to the Lancastrian cause, refusing to let the capture of her husband end her fight. As York solidified his position in London, setting the stage for governance, Margaret was gathering forces in the northern counties, where Lancastrian loyalty was strongest. The contrast between the two could not have been starker"	1912	1989.1709
"But she never wavered for one moment as to her determination to see Enid Glenwilliam within the next fortnight; nor did the question of Arthur's personal happiness enter for one moment into her calculations. CHAPTER XI THE breakfast gong had just sounded at Hoddon Grey. The hour was a quarter to nine. Prayers in the chapel were over, and Lord and Lady Newbury, at either end of the table, spectacles on nose, were opening and reading their letters. ""Where is Edward?"" said Lady William, looking round."	"""He hasn't come down yet,"" replied Lord Newbury, without lifting his eyes from the thick letter he was scrutinizing. ""Probably still abed. You know how he is; always the last to rise."" Lady William frowned slightly, a crease forming between her brows. ""He knows we have an early start today. We were to go over to the Darlington estate at ten. It's unlike Edward to be so inconsiderate."" Just then, the sound of hurried footsteps approached, and Edward appeared at the doorway, his hair slightly tousled and his tie askew. ""I apologize for my tardiness,"" he panted, taking his seat quickly. ""I had some matters to attend to that couldn't wait."" Lord Newbury waved a dismissive hand, his attention returning to his correspondence. ""Just see to it that it doesn't happen again. We have a schedule to keep."" Breakfast proceeded with the usual clatter of silver and china, the family engaging in sporadic conversation about the events planned for the day. Lady William, however, seemed distracted, her"	1913	1921.0085
If the air is stable below the condensation level, every parcel will resist vertical motion and will require some small force to push it upward. Parcels will try to escape going up the hill by every possible detour through ravines or valleys. All the work expended to force them upward must come from the energy of the wind, which, if it is not strong enough, will fail in its task. If, on the other hand, the air is in equilibrium or slightly unstable, very little energy, if any, need be expended to lift the parcels uphill. As the parcels rise they cool at the usual rate and eventually arrive at the condensation level. Should the condensation level of the parcels as determined by their temperature and dewpoint spread be too high, no cloud will appear; instead, a strong wind will occur over the hilltop, speeding the parcels down the other side. Assuming sufficient moisture in each parcel to insure a low condensation level a cloud will form with a flat base at the altitude of parcel saturation.	"This cloud, once formed, may grow vertically if the conditions above the condensation level continue to be unstable, allowing the parcels to rise further and cool, condensing more moisture as they ascend. This process can give rise to cumulus clouds, which are often seen billowing upwards in such unstable atmospheric conditions. Conversely, in a stable air mass where the parcels are reluctant to rise, the formation of clouds might be limited to a thin layer, resembling more of a stratus type, spread out horizontally rather than growing vertically. Furthermore, the presence of a mountain or hill can significantly influence local weather patterns through orographic lifting, where air is forced to rise over the terrain, leading to adiabatic cooling and, frequently, precipitation on the windward side of the elevation. This effect can lead to the formation of a ""rain shadow"" on the leeward side, where less precipitation occurs due to the descent and warming of the air parcels. Thus, the stability of the atmosphere and the geographical features of the terrain interact to create a diverse array of meteorological phenomena."	1913	1998.711
"Their guns were almost useless, since they could not be placed in positions from which they could fire on the barricades except so close as to be under effective rifle fire. They made several desperate assaults, most of which were repulsed. In Goldhawk Road a Jaeger battalion contrived to rush the big rampart of paving stones which had been improvised by the British ; but once over, they were decimated by the fire from the houses on either side of the street. Big high explosive shells from Richmond Hill, too, began to drop among the Saxons. Though the range was long, the gunners were evidently well informed of the whereabouts of  the Saxon troops, and made wonderfully lucky shooting.  "" For some time the distant rumble of the firing to the southwest had been growing more distinct in their ears, and about four o'clock it suddenly broke out comparatively near by. Then came an order from Prince Henry to fall back on Ealing at once."	The retreat was conducted in a disorderly manner, with the troops scrambling to organize themselves amidst the chaos. The British forces, sensing the weakening resolve of their adversaries, pressed their advantage with increased vigor. As the Saxons hurriedly moved through the streets towards Ealing, the sounds of gunfire and explosions echoed relentlessly around them, a stark reminder of the peril they faced. Meanwhile, the British artillery continued their relentless barrage, the accuracy of their fire only improving as they adjusted their ranges based on the movements of the retreating enemy. Each shell that landed brought with it a devastating effect, tearing through the ranks of the Saxons and sending fragments of pavement and debris into the air. The morale of the Saxon troops faltered with each step, as the realization set in that they were being driven back with considerable force. The once orderly and disciplined battalions now resembled a ragged mass of men, their formations broken, and their spirits dampened by the fierce resistance they encountered. As they reached the relative safety of Ealing, the remnants of the Saxon forces attempted to regroup. Command	1906	1950.365
"The whole treatise is simple, lucid, illuminating and fascinating. Never before have we read a work dealing with law and social justice which was so engaging and informing in character. He who peruses it will have his general culture greatly extended; nor will he find it hard reading. Take, for example, the opening paragraphs of the work. Here we have presented in a few sentences the law as a moral power, various means of moulding and controlling men, the object of the law happiness, and leading means of control contrasted. ""The law is a means of moulding and controlling men — one means by which the controlling power in a community bends individuals and institutions to its will. It consists of rules and regulations prescribed by the governing authority and requires obedience from the governed."	The essence of law lies not only in the enforcement but in its ability to reflect the moral and ethical standards of a society. It is thus a dynamic entity, continually evolving as the collective conscience of the populace shifts. This evolution is necessary, for static law risks becoming obsolete or oppressive, failing to serve its primary function as a promoter of societal welfare and justice. Moreover, the law serves as a mediator of relations between individuals and between individuals and the state. It sets boundaries that protect rights and define duties. It seeks to balance individual freedoms with the common good, often navigating complex ethical dilemmas. This balancing act is critical in maintaining social order and ensuring that the pursuit of happiness by some does not infringe upon the rights of others. One of the primary roles of law is to provide mechanisms for resolving conflicts that inevitably arise in any complex society. Through courts and similar institutions, the law interprets and applies legal rules to specific situations, thereby offering a peaceful means of dispute resolution that avoids the chaos of personal retribution. Thus, the law is not merely a set of commands with attached penalties. It	1911	2004.2144
In hearing or reading our own language we largely anticipate what is coming and this is what renders us liable to be bored. Thus the very ease of our apprehension makes us inattentive. With persons who speak like a book and with parsons at sermon, it is often enough to hear the beginning of a paragraph and wake up again at its end, quite sure we have absorbed the contents of a long stretch of discourse. Psychologically speaking, we stand in a very different relation to our own and to a foreign language. What we speak or write our motor currents, starting in the brain, we will say, transmit to our vocal organs or our pens, along nerve fibres so habituated to such impressions that the consciousness does not become alive till we hear what we have said, or read what we have written. This is proved by the not uncommon experience that, while writing unconsciously, we spell correctly words that we misspell if we consciously attempt them: which shows how trite the native word and phrase become. On the other hand, when we read or listen, our sensory currents, transmitting to the brain what we see or hear, throb the more actively in proportion to the novelty, the strangeness of the object of consciousness.	Thus, a text in a foreign language demands a heightened alertness and concentration; every word and phrase is a puzzle to be deciphered, engaging more of our mental faculties. This engagement brings with it a sense of novelty and challenge that can often make the experience far more stimulating than that of processing one's native tongue. This is not to say that our own language cannot surprise or challenge us, but rather that the routine and familiarity of it can sometimes lead to a passive reception rather than active interaction. The effect is that in a foreign language, each sentence demands our full attention, and we are less likely to drift into the mental autopilot that can occur when listening to our native language. This cognitive effort can make the learning and understanding of a foreign language both exhausting and exhilarating. Moreover, it often leads to a deeper processing of the content, which can enhance comprehension and retention. In contrast, the familiarity of our own language can sometimes be a detriment to engagement. We anticipate structures, predict endings, and often gloss over the details, especially in contexts or formats we encounter frequently, such as daily	1911	1985.5096
"They are told that they did  249 hot give enough, or too little, or not at the right time, etc. They lose faith in the laboratory, their clients lose faith in them and go off to ""false gods."" These laboratories, the germ theories and germ chasing, seem only schemes to glorify and magnify the allopathic interests, daze the public and lead them finally to believe in the necessity for a ""National Health Bureau."" The Pure Food and Drugs Act is made to play its part, apparently, for Dr. Harrington, one of its sponsors, said: ""The National Food and Drug Act, I repeat, is not. primarily a health law and from the standpoint of health is not needed."	Yet it serves as a vehicle through which certain regulations can be enforced, ostensibly for the public good, but in a manner that sometimes seems more beneficial to certain industries and professions. The public is often left bewildered by the conflicting information and the shifting paradigms of health that emerge from these authoritative bodies. As a result, there is a growing distrust not only towards these institutions but also towards the medical profession as a whole, which is seen as increasingly entangled with commercial interests. The rise of alternative medicine and the growing interest in holistic approaches can be seen as a direct response to this disillusionment. People are seeking ways to take control of their own health, often turning to traditional and natural remedies that promise fewer side effects and a more personal approach to well-being. This shift is not merely a trend but a profound change in the way health and medicine are perceived. The challenge for the medical community is to bridge this growing divide, to restore trust, and to integrate the best of both traditional and modern medical practices in a way that truly serves the best interest of the public.	1911	1991.7415
Private House Lighting. DISCUSSION. [Discussion of two papers by Mr. W. R. Rawlings and Mr. W. H. Y. Webber on the Lighting of Private Housei by Electricity nnd Gas respectively, read at a meeting of the Illuminating Engineering Society, at the House of the Royal Society of Arts (London), on Tuesday, April 18th, 1912. See ante, pp. 235-268, May, 1912.] THE CHAIRMAN, in declaring the discussion open, said there were many very human touches in both papers, which were in the nature of philosophical, literary, and even humorous dissertations, rather than strictly technical contributions. They were fully up to the standard of the Society's transactions.	He noted that the papers offered a rich comparative analysis of the two dominant forms of lighting—electricity and gas—highlighting their respective merits and drawbacks in the context of private house lighting. This, he believed, provided a valuable basis for a lively and informative discussion. Mr. A. J. Stevens rose first to speak. He commended Mr. Rawlings for his thorough exposition on the advancements in electric lighting technology, particularly the introduction of more efficient and less glaring bulbs which made electric lighting increasingly favorable in household use. He highlighted the importance of considering the aesthetic effects of lighting in addition to its functional benefits, suggesting that the soft, diffused light of modern electric lamps could enhance home decor and even influence mood and well-being. Following Mr. Stevens, Ms. Eleanor Fortesque expressed her appreciation for Mr. Webber's defense of gas lighting. She pointed out that despite the rapid growth of electricity, gas lighting still held significant advantages, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness and reliability during periods of electrical outages. Moreover, she mentioned the recent innovations in gas lighting, including improved safety	1912	1983.0914
The habit is, therefore, harmful to the true aims of the will if it has settled in fields in which the conditions vary and where new adjustments are needed. Hence habits enrich us and make us free to give our efforts to higher aims, but habits also enslave us and resist our efforts. Education must be most careful to consider both aspects of habit formation. The fundamental rule for the development of habits is certainly to begin with a strong resolution and never to allow an exception. The number of positive repetitions is by no means so important as the continuity of the series. Every exception interferes seriously with the forming of the new paths of least resistance. The child who is  194   to develop any habit of action or behaviour is served worst if a weak indulgence allows him occasional exceptions. Every opportunity for repeating ought to be made use of.	It is essential to remember that the formation of habits is not merely a mechanical process; it involves the active and conscious participation of the individual. The role of attention cannot be overstated in this context. The more attentively a task is performed during the initial phase of habit formation, the more deeply it is ingrained. This is why the educational environment must be structured in such a way that it supports focused and undistracted engagement with the task at hand. Moreover, the emotional context in which habits are formed is also crucial. Positive emotions associated with the behavior reinforce the habit, making it more likely to stick. Conversely, if the habit is associated with negative emotions, resistance to it may develop. Hence, educators must strive to make the learning process enjoyable and rewarding. In addition to forming habits, there is also the critical task of breaking bad habits, which requires an equally systematic approach. This often involves creating a conscious awareness of the habit, understanding its triggers and consequences, and then methodically replacing it with a more desirable behavior. Ultimately, the aim of education in the context of habit formation should	1909	1999.7606
After all, what demand is satisfied by them? What we seek in seeking our pleasures is a certain state of ourselves. We call pleasure that state of ourselves which we aim to continue, and displeasure or pain that which we aim to break up. The thing which we like because it brings us pleasure has no value whatever in itself. The thing which we dislike because it brings us pain is not worthless in itself. The one may please our senses, the other may hurt our senses, but it is our little, personal concern. The world is not better or worse by it. But is that really the only kind of values which we know ? Let us seek our way by comparing our purposes with our objects in the world. What kind of objects do we know ?	We know objects that exist merely to satisfy immediate physical or sensory desires—these are often fleeting and changeable. And then there are those objects which, though they may also provide immediate pleasure, resonate with deeper, more enduring values. These can include works of art, enduring friendships, or pursuits of knowledge, which not only gratify but also enrich and expand our sense of self and our connection to others. Beyond the realm of personal satisfaction, there are objects and endeavors valued for their utility in achieving broader societal goals. Institutions such as schools, hospitals, and public services are valued not merely for the direct pleasure they provide to individuals but for their role in fostering a healthy, educated, and well-functioning society. Furthermore, there exist values that transcend both personal gratification and utilitarian function. These include ethical principles like justice, truth, and beauty. Such values inspire us to act in ways that might not bring immediate pleasure or have practical utility but are pursued because they are inherently right or beautiful. Thus, our interaction with the world is not limited to a simple exchange of pleasure and pain. It includes	1909	1991.3381
"vi. and yii. The actor's suggestion was excellent, and the result most amusing. * Boaden publishes (vol. ii. p. 559) another letter from Beaumarchais about the English translation of Evgtnie (see p. 152), in which the author promises to send Garrick an abstract of a new drama which he haa iust given to the Comedy Franchise : ""The first copy printed will follow the abstract sent to you."" The piece in question was Let Deux amis, acted January 1770 ; but Beaumarchais appears to have sent neither it nor the Barbter. * The others were M. fitzmaurice (Lord Shelburne's brother), Colonel Bar', Dr. Hawkesworth (Garrick's former comrade at Edial), and Benjamin Franklin, at that date Commissioner for Pennsylvania. Shelburne had read Morellet's Dietionnaire du commerce and had been much impressed by the liberal principles of the French Ecole 6conomique there advocated."	Shelburne's engagement with the ideas of the French Economists was not merely academic; it influenced his political stance significantly, especially in matters of trade and economic policy. He was known for advocating for free trade principles, which resonated with the laissez-faire policies promoted by the French school. His interactions with figures like Franklin and Morellet enriched his understanding and appreciation of economic liberalization, which he believed could lead to greater prosperity and less interference in the lives of the citizens. Franklin, on his part, brought with him from America a perspective that aligned well with the economic theories discussed among these intellectuals. His practical knowledge of colonial trade and its challenges provided a real-world anchor to the theoretical discussions. Franklin’s diplomatic skills and intellectual curiosity made him a central figure in these gatherings, facilitating exchanges that bridged the theoretical and practical aspects of economic policy. As these men convened, their discussions often veered into the realms of philosophy, governance, and ethics, reflecting the Enlightenment's holistic approach to knowledge. They debated not only economic principles but also their implications for society and governance. These	1912	1991.9738
"The laughter subsided, an expectant silence fell over the whole table, and precisely at that moment of breathless suspense the voice of Valetta was heard to say very clearly, "" Er — ahem! How are the pheasants doing this year?"" Some silly ingenue tittered, and even the most diplomatic were unable to refrain from a glance toward the head of the table. By all Black's calculation the Duchess should have looked extremely foolish, but Valetta put her head back slightly, looked down the table with a gentle smile of tolerant approval, and turned to receive her host's answer. It was certainly not Valetta who was covered with confusion, but many others of the Davidsons' guests had a curious feeling that they had been betrayed into a breach of good manners, and later they sought opportunities of amusing the Duchess, and it was noticeable that Black was not quite a success. It almost seemed that the avoidance of Black was a recommendation to favour in the eyes of the Duchess."	The evening progressed, and the atmosphere subtly shifted. Guests who initially felt awkward began to engage more freely, their earlier discomfort fading into the background of lively conversations and laughter. The Duchess, with her adept social graces, navigated the dinner with an ease that suggested she was accustomed to smoothing over less than perfect situations. Her ability to deflect awkwardness without seeming to try was a trait that many admired, though few could emulate. As the courses were served, the topic of the pheasants was forgotten, replaced by discussions of art, politics, and the occasional light-hearted debate. The Duchess, ever the attentive hostess, made sure to include everyone in the conversation, her eyes twinkling with mirth as she moved from one guest to another, eliciting smiles and laughter with her witty remarks. Meanwhile, Black, sensing his diminishing influence, tried to regain his footing by contributing more vigorously to the conversation. However, his attempts seemed to only further alienate him from the guests, who now responded to his interjections with polite nods rather than genuine interest. It was apparent that his earlier	1913	1982.5034
A father is by law entitled to the guardianship of his legitimate children and a Court of Common-Law has no jurisdiction to deprive him of that right. This seems always to have been the law. The Court of Chancery, however, representing the King, as parens patrice, has been held to have the right to control the father's right to the possession of his child. This final decision in the earlier part of the i9th century, after many conflicting decisions, received much public attention and disapproval.	The principle behind this was that the welfare of the child was paramount, and the paternal rights could be overridden if the child's well-being was at risk. This doctrine of the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration has since become a cornerstone of family law, not only in England but in many jurisdictions around the world. It has led to the development of detailed statutory and case law concerning child custody and guardianship, reflecting the evolving societal understanding that children's rights and interests must be protected. In subsequent years, the power of the Chancery to intervene in family matters expanded, allowing it to make determinations regarding not only custody but also education and the administration of any property belonging to the child. These powers were exercised with the understanding that the Court acted as a benevolent guardian in the best interests of the child, a concept that has been refined but essentially remains in practice today. As family dynamics and societal norms have continued to evolve, so too have the laws governing the rights of parents and the protection of children. Modern legal frameworks typically allow for shared custody arrangements and recognize the rights of both mothers	1908	1984.8528
There is much in the writings of Burgess and Bluntschli which leads me to say that, consciously or unconsciously, they are Platonists. They seem to be a search of an ideal political system which has never yet existed on this earth but which is discoverable — perhaps in nubibus or in gremio philosophorum. They differ from Plato and submit to the influence of modern ideas in their method of search. They collate and compare all that seems best or seems inevitable in certain existing systems. I have pointed out that Burgess cannot dispense with history. The same is true of Bluntschli.	Both scholars see in history not merely a record of past events, but a rich source of understanding human nature and societal evolution. Their approach is empirical and analytical, rather than purely speculative. They sift through historical data, identifying patterns and principles that could inform the construction of a more perfect polity. This method reflects a fundamental shift from the Platonic ideal of deriving insights from abstract philosophical reasoning alone. Instead, they embrace a form of realism that acknowledges the imperfections of human societies while striving for an ideal. Bluntschli, in particular, integrates legal and constitutional theory with practical governance. His work on the theory of the state emphasizes the necessity of a legal framework that balances authority with liberty, and the need for a government structure that is both efficient and adaptable to the cultural and historical context of a society. Similarly, Burgess’s political science introduces a comparative approach that highlights the importance of national sovereignty coupled with international law. Their writings, therefore, while echoing the Platonic quest for an ideal state, are grounded in a pragmatic examination of political realities. They propose a synthesis of the best elements of existing	1908	2005.7357

The revival of interest in various forms of lighting, particularly in contexts where electric power is less accessible or feasible, underscores a broader trend of diversification in light sources used in public and private settings. As technological advancements continue, each method—electric, gas, oil, and acetylene—finds its niche based on efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. The exploration of these different lighting technologies is not only a matter of engineering but also of aesthetic and practical considerations in urban planning and design. The ongoing developments in lamp technology, whether for street lighting, household use, or specialized applications like electric vehicles, reflect a dynamic and evolving field where innovation plays a key role	1912	2003.2405
General Illuminating Engineering. Turning next to papers on general lighting problems, we may take first, that by MR. E. L. ELLIOT on ' The Determination of Luminous Efficiency.' Luminous efficiency, as applied to interior lighting, is a somewhat uncertain phrase. It has sometimes been used to denote the percentage of the total light falling on the working plane. But horizontal illumination is not always the most effective. For example, lighting is often carried out on sloping desks. Mr. Elliot therefore proposes that one should make a measurement of the total amount of light reaching an object from points above the plane in which the object is situated.	He suggests that effective luminous efficiency should include not only the direct illumination but also the indirect and reflected light which contribute to the overall visibility in a space. In his study, Mr. Elliot introduces a method for calculating a 'composite luminous efficiency' which combines these various factors, providing a more holistic measure of how light serves an environment. To achieve this, he uses a combination of photometric measurements and computer modeling to simulate various lighting scenarios. By adjusting the positions and intensities of lights, as well as the reflectance properties of room surfaces, he is able to predict how different lighting designs will affect the perceived brightness and usability of a space. This approach, Mr. Elliot argues, allows for a more nuanced understanding of lighting efficiency, moving beyond traditional metrics that do not account for the complexity of real-world environments. It also provides designers and engineers with a powerful tool to optimize lighting for specific tasks, preferences, and conditions, potentially leading to significant improvements in both energy efficiency and user satisfaction.	1912	2006.3909
Some of the effect we may probably also attribute to the combination of complementary factors; but whether heterozygosis, or complementary action, is at work, our experience of cross breeding in general makes it practically certain that genetic factors of special classes only can have these properties, and no pains should be spared in identifying them. It is not impossible that such identifi 1 Bureau of Plant Industry, Bulletin No. 191, 1910.  cation would throw light on the nature of cell division and of that meristic process by which the repeated organs of living things are constituted, and I have much confidence that in the course of the analysis discoveries will be made bearing directly both on the general theory of heredity and on the practical industry of breeding.	The importance of understanding these genetic interactions extends beyond mere academic interest, as they hold the potential to revolutionize our approaches to agriculture and medicine. By manipulating these genetic factors, we could enhance crop resistance to diseases and pests, improve nutritional qualities, and even extend shelf life, thereby contributing to global food security. Similarly, in the field of medicine, a deeper grasp of genetic principles can lead to more effective personalized treatments and the potential to preemptively address hereditary diseases. Continued research in this field, therefore, is not only a pursuit of knowledge but a practical imperative. The methodologies of Mendelian genetics, coupled with the newer techniques of molecular biology and genetic engineering, provide powerful tools for this exploration. As we delve deeper into the genetic makeup of organisms, we must also consider the ethical implications of our findings and the technologies they enable. The balance between genetic advancement and ethical responsibility will undoubtedly be a significant challenge as we move forward, but it is a necessary consideration to ensure the beneficial application of our scientific discoveries for all of society.	1911	2006.9897
"The pretence that the action of the Supreme Court amounts merely to an interpretation of an existing law is a hollow mockery — a palpable equivocation — and in the face of the repeated refusal of Congress to amend the law so as to apply only to unreasonable combinations in restraint of trade, it is utterly inconsistent with any regard for the intelligence of Congress. That this decision is an usurpation of legislative power is apparent. What is interpretation? It is a mere declaration of what words mean, and the meaning of words remains always the same. Any attempt to direct that words affecting public function or a statute shall be construed in a sense different from their ordinary meaning, is not interpretation, but legislation. When the Court in its interpretation of the anti trust law decided that a combination in restraint of trade must be an ""unreasonable"" one to be illegal, it committed a palpable transgression of its powers; it legislated."	"It altered the plain meaning of the statute as passed by Congress, which made no such qualification as ""unreasonable."" Thus, the judicial branch has effectively rewritten the law, substituting its judgment for that of the legislative branch, which is both improper and dangerous. This encroachment not only disrupts the balance of powers as outlined in the Constitution but also sets a precedent that could allow for further judicial activism, undermining the very foundation of our legal system where laws are meant to be created and amended by the elected representatives of the people, not by the judiciary. The implications of such actions are profound, as they could lead to a judiciary that not only interprets laws but also molds them according to its views, potentially disregarding the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives. This undermines democratic principles and could lead to a lack of accountability in government, where judges are not elected and are therefore not directly answerable to the populace. The necessity for a clear separation of powers and for each branch of government to respect the limits of its authority is paramount in maintaining the function and integrity of our democratic"	1911	1955.6387
His patron impresses upon him that the one  384 Twentieth Century Magazine disgraceful thing in life is failure. This teaching bears bitter fruit in the lad's life. He becomes a dabbler in occult mysteries, and for a time yields to the temptation which his knowledge places in his path. In the end, however, the light breaks and we leave him with his face set toward the heights. The action is swift, and the story is told with all Mr. Oppenheim's ability in weaving a fascinating and exciting romance. Amy C. Rich. Stanton Wins. By Eleanor M. Ingram. Illustrated. Cloth.	"New York: Harper & Brothers. $1.50. In ""Stanton Wins,"" Eleanor M. Ingram crafts a compelling narrative centered around the ambitions and trials of young Stanton, a man driven by an insatiable desire to succeed in the cutthroat world of early twentieth-century business. The novel opens with Stanton at a crucial crossroads; having just lost a significant business deal, he is confronted with the harsh realities of his pursuit. The story unfolds as he navigates through both personal and professional challenges, driven by the fear of failure instilled in him by his patron. Through Ingram's vivid storytelling, readers are drawn into the bustling streets of New York, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye. Stanton's journey is peppered with a cast of characters that challenge his worldview, including a wise mentor who teaches him that true success comes not from conquering others, but from mastering oneself. As Stanton grapples with his ambitions and the ethical dilemmas they spawn, Ingram explores themes of integrity, redemption, and the true meaning of success. The narrative builds to a"	1911	2001.1726
"Michaelis walked past her to the window and looked out over the Park, at its lakes, its dotted evergreens, its long, curving driveways over which motorcars were crawling, and far beyond, on the heights, at a white marble structure where he had made his first successes in therapeutics. He turned and went over to the door. Sylvia, still challenging, had not quitted him with her eyes, but it was not until he had picked up his hat and coat and stood with the door half open that he turned and met them. ""tomorrow, at three, "" he said, quietly, as he went out. The next afternoon, clear and crisp, his motor swept her up through the Park. She had taken half her usual quantity of the drug, and sat back deep in the soft cushions, pale and languid, eluding observation. At seventy second Street a rustic arbour, with thick vine trunks lacing through its peeling frame, caught her eye."	"It was there, amidst the quietude of the park's lesser-traveled paths, where children once played and lovers whispered secrets under the sheltering embrace of its canopy.

As they passed, her thoughts drifted to earlier days, when life was less complicated and her burdens lighter. Michaelis noticed the subtle shift in her expression, the softening around her eyes as they lingered on the arbour.

Propeller. p„ — Thrust Grading Curve. f0 = Torsional Resistance Grading Curves. at 900revs.permin. and 100 ftper sec. forwardspeed. 195 In the same way as equation (21) was obtained we could write down po = (A>„ - KaV).W, .b (22) and similar equations for pi and p3, and from these obtain the normal thrust and also the pitching moment when yawing, involving only the same quantities as before but combined in a different manner. This has been done for BE. 2, and we obtain Thrust = 392 lbB.	Pitching Moment = 50 ft-lbs. These values, derived from the equations, provide a basis for understanding the dynamic behavior of the propeller under specified conditions. It is essential to note that the thrust and pitching moment are influenced by both the rotational speed and the forward speed of the propeller, as indicated by the variables in the equations. To further refine our understanding, we can analyze the impact of varying these speeds. For instance, increasing the rotational speed while maintaining a constant forward speed will typically result in an increase in both thrust and pitching moment, due to the enhanced aerodynamic forces acting on the propeller blades. Conversely, increasing the forward speed at a constant rotational speed might decrease the pitching moment due to a relative decrease in the angle of attack on the blades, while potentially increasing the thrust due to higher dynamic pressure. Continuing from this analysis, it's also crucial to consider the effects of environmental factors such as air density and temperature, as these can significantly alter the performance characteristics of the propeller. For example, lower air density, as found at higher altitudes, can reduce	1912	1994.3446
"In order to measure horizontal illumination one may replace the tube T' by the arrangement indicated at M. This utilises a 45 mirror (or a total reflection prism) in order to reflect the light falling upon a translucent, horizontal observation screen. In practice it is preferable to have the scale S calibrated direct in lux (bougie metres), o: - in such a way that it is only necessary to multiply the reading by the candle power of the standard. One can also make use of coloured screens if desirable ; but it appears that the accuracy of reading is impaired to some extent by so doing. Some experiments carried out with screens of white, light yellow, and light and dark red tints showed that in the first two cases the difference between the readings was less than 5 percent. But with the third named screen deviations of as much as 8 percent were observed, and with the others even more. As explained above, the construction of this instrument enables one to measure at all possible inclinations, and thus to build up what Maacart has termed the "" solide d'eclaire ment, ""* having as its base the horizontal surface, and showing the intensity of all illumination in all directions."	This comprehensive capability allows for an assessment of the illumination environment in a full 360-degree field, which is critical in architectural and environmental lighting design to ensure uniformity and adequacy of light distribution. The principle behind this device is rooted in the classic law of inverse squares, which states that the intensity of light radiating from a point source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Thus, by accurately measuring the intensity at various points and orientations, one can extrapolate the overall effectiveness of the lighting setup. Furthermore, the device’s ability to work with different colored screens, despite the noted variations in accuracy, is invaluable for studies where the color temperature of the light is a variable of interest. For instance, in environments where mood setting or circadian rhythm influence is critical, understanding how different light colors affect perceived intensity can guide design decisions. The next step in utilizing this instrument involves plotting the gathered data onto a photometric curve, which visually represents the intensity distribution. This curve is essential for detailed analysis and comparison against industry standards or specific lighting requirements of a space. By employing such	1912	1997.0294

This method of scaling and calculating the dimensions and forces in structural analysis allows engineers to visualize and quantify the stresses and deflections beams undergo under various loads. By using vector polygons and diagrams, the engineer can graphically solve for moments, shear forces, and deflections, which are critical in ensuring the structural integrity and safety of the designed structure. The application of these principles and methods in practical scenarios requires careful consideration of the materials used, the geometry of the structure, and the nature of the loads applied. For instance, in the construction of bridges, buildings, and other civil engineering projects, these calculations help in determining the appropriate dimensions of beams, girders, and other structural elements to prevent failure. Moreover, understanding the graphical representation and its corresponding physical implications allows engineers to optimize structures for both material use and performance. This optimization not only ensures safety and compliance with building codes but also contributes to cost efficiency and sustainability in construction projects. By accurately analyzing and applying these principles, engineers can design structures that adequately resist imposed loads while	1908	1997.0715
In Alfred, the Christ spirit shines through his words and deeds. He is no monkish pietist, prating of holy texts in sanctimonious tones, but a great, brave, tender, wise, loving and just man who strives to make his nation good and great. The drama opens just after the terrible defeat of King Alfred at the battle of Chippenham. The King has fled into the forests, where a little child, playing in her woodland bower, finds him and brings him milk and bread, since he is well nigh famished. His life saved, he sets out to reunite his scattered forces and prepare for a great and final stand against the Danes. Knowing the coming battle will be decisive, and realising the importance of knowing the enemy's strength and the position of its forces, he discloses to his young wife his determination to disguise himself as a wandering minstrel and visit the enemy's stronghold.	Elsbeth, his queen, though fraught with worry for his safety, understands the necessity of his daring plan and blesses him with a fervent prayer for his protection. Clad in humble garb, Alfred ventures into the heart of the Danish camp, his harp slung across his back and his heart heavy with the weight of his kingdom’s fate. As he mingles among the enemy, he sings songs of the Saxon homeland, subtly weaving tales of valor and the resilience of his people, all the while gathering crucial information about the Danes' numbers, their state of morale, and their plans for the forthcoming battle. His guise as a minstrel allows him intimate glimpses into the Danish ranks, and he learns not only of their military strategies but also of the dissent and weariness growing among their warriors. Nights spent around campfires reveal the stories of young Danes longing for home, tired of endless wars. Alfred’s heart grows heavy with the shared pain of all soldiers, friend and foe alike, bound by the common thread of human suffering in the face of conflict. 	1911	1940.7046

Nasal passages long, opening in front near the end of the snout, behind far back in the throat. Pupil vertical; upper and lower eyelids, and a nictitating membrane. No clavicles. Manus with five digits, pes with four; the three inner digits clawed. A dorsal armour of bony scutes. Oviparous, shell of egg calcareous. Genus Crocodilus. Fourth mandibular tooth usually fitting into a notch in the upper jaw; 16 to 19 teeth in the upper and 14 to 15 in the lower jaw on each side.	Species Crocodilus niloticus. Commonly known as the Nile Crocodile. Found extensively along the Nile River and sub-Saharan Africa, this species is one of the most formidable members of the crocodile family. It can reach lengths of up to 6 meters, though average sizes tend to be slightly smaller. Its coloration varies from a dark olive green to a muddy brown, with darker crossbands on the tail and body during its juvenile stage, which fade as the animal matures. The diet of Crocodilus niloticus is broad, consisting primarily of fish, birds, and small mammals, though larger individuals are capable of taking down sizeable ungulates such as zebras and wildebeests. They are apex predators in their environments, with few natural enemies aside from humans. Reproductive behaviors of the Nile Crocodile are notable; females lay between 25 to 80 eggs, which they deposit in sandy banks or in decomposing vegetation. The heat from the decomposing plant matter helps incubate the eggs. Females are fiercely protective of their nesting sites and will guard	1909	1995.9597
A light wind often displaces the fog to the leeward without altering its outline. The lower sketch of Figure 132 illustrates a small patch of modified steam fog over a river. UPSLOPE FOG. — Whenever and wherever parcels of air are forced to travel uphill, they lose their temperature and dewpoint spread at the rate of approximately 5.0F per each 1000 feet of altitude gained. Parcels with  265 spread sufficient to remain unsaturated for a full journey over a hill or up a broad slope will experience cooling only; parcels with a spread too small to permit an unsaturated journey will become clouded before they reach the height of terrain. The total initial spread and the vertical height of terrain up which air must flow determine whether or not parcels will be Fiqure 1 33. Upslope fog.	In cases where the terrain is particularly steep or the ascent rapid, the likelihood of upslope fog formation increases. The cooling effect induced by elevation causes the air's moisture to condense into tiny droplets, forming a dense, opaque fog that clings to the slopes. This phenomenon is often observed in mountainous regions where warm, moist air is driven upward by prevailing winds, cooling as it rises until it reaches saturation. The resulting fog can be particularly persistent and thick, reducing visibility dramatically and affecting both ground and air traffic in these regions. It is not uncommon for upslope fog to linger for days, especially in areas where the geographical conditions consistently force air upward and the temperature gradients are sufficient to maintain the condensed state of the moisture. For meteorologists and climatologists, understanding the dynamics of upslope fog is crucial for accurate weather forecasting in mountainous areas. It involves detailed knowledge of local topography, wind patterns, and temperature profiles to predict when and where fog is likely to form. This knowledge is also vital for planning and safety considerations in affected areas, as upslope fog can significantly impact	1913	2001.2091
This in M. de Tourville's view was the central institution of feudalism, which triumphed under Charlemagne, the typical owner of great manorial estates. These estates were self contained and isolated, each self supporting with its own industries and its own government — the apotheosis of the particularist family,  involving the subordination of public to private life. But excellent as this organisation seems to M. de Tourville, it did not last. The peasants grew rich and commuted their services for fixed dues. The towns bought their emancipation. The Lords of the Manor sunk from directors of industry to receivers of fixed rents. Deprived of their local functions, and with their fixed incomes becoming less and less in purchasing power, they became crusaders and knight errants and set up in Jerusalem and elsewhere forma! copies of decaying feudalism.	As the manorial system waned, the rise of a mercantile class began to reshape the social and economic landscape. The once all-powerful lords found themselves increasingly dependent on the financial resources of town merchants and bankers. The balance of power subtly shifted as commerce and trade began to dominate, leading to the growth of cities and the decline of rural feudal estates. This transition was marked by the burgeoning influence of guilds and the establishment of municipal charters, which further eroded the traditional feudal bonds and led to a more diversified socio-economic structure. The knights and nobles, their fortunes dwindling and their relevance in local governance reduced, sought glory and wealth in foreign lands. However, their attempts to transplant their ancestral way of life onto new territories often failed to take root in the face of evolving political and economic realities. The ideals of feudalism—loyalty, land-based wealth, and hierarchical order—were gradually supplanted by the emerging paradigms of capitalism and centralized state power. Thus, while M. de Tourville extolled the virtues of feudalism's self-sufficient man	1908	1976.9635
If now from that other direction an impression comes which ordinarily would push us toward itself, it finds the channels closed. Then it cannot become vivid, it remains inhibited, while everything which helps us to give importance to that to which we are turning will rush to the mind on the associational paths. The wider we open one channel of discharge, the more we exclude the impressions which would lead us in the opposite direction. The more intensely we read our book, the more easily we may fail to hear if some one knocks at our door. From these most trivial rivalries to the most complex and highest reactions of the personality, it is always the same story. We associate that which fits in with our action and suppress that which interferes with our action. Everything which changes our motor system thus indirectly changes our power to experience the world.	This dynamic interaction between selective attention and sensory input shapes not only our immediate perceptions but also our longer-term psychological orientations. As we habitually focus on certain stimuli and ignore others, we reinforce specific neural pathways, gradually sculpting our cognitive architecture. This process of selective attention and associative learning underpins much of our behavior, guiding our preferences and aversions, our fears and desires. In the realm of emotion, this mechanism is particularly evident. For instance, a person who consistently focuses on potential threats in their environment is likely to develop a heightened state of anxiety; their neural pathways become primed to perceive danger, often at the expense of more neutral or positive stimuli. Conversely, someone who habitually focuses on positive aspects of their environment may cultivate a more optimistic outlook, reinforcing pathways that perceive and prioritize positive cues. Thus, our selective attention not only determines what we perceive in the moment but also plays a crucial role in shaping our overall psychological resilience and vulnerability. By understanding the power of this focus, we can begin to see why certain patterns of thought and behavior seem so intractable, and how, by	1909	2007.5804
The plum may be quite successfully root grafted in the house in the winter, as recommended for the apple and treated the same way, but it generally takes a year longer to get the tree formed, since in this case the growth from the cion is quite slow the first two years. On account of this slow growth root grafted plum trees are often crooked and unpromising. This defect, however, may be remedied by cutting away in the early spring of the second year all the growth from the cion except one strong bud at the base. If this work is done very early in the spring it will result in throwing the whole strength of the root into a single bud and the forming of a stem that is straight in place of the former crooked one. A much better and more satisfactory plan than root grafting is to plant the stocks in the nursery one year before they are intended to be grafted, and then graft them below the surface of the ground very early in the spring. For this purpose cleft or whip grafting should be used.	This method allows the scion to establish a more robust union with the rootstock, as the graft is protected by the soil from environmental stresses such as wind and extreme temperatures. Additionally, the moisture retained in the soil can aid in the healing process, promoting a stronger, more vigorous growth. The stocks should be well-prepared and healthy, with a diameter suitable for the chosen grafting technique.  When performing cleft grafting, a vertical cut is made into the stock, and a scion with a wedge-shaped end is inserted into the slit. The graft should then be sealed with grafting wax or tape to prevent desiccation and infection. In whip grafting, both the stock and the scion are cut diagonally to match each other closely, then joined and secured.  After grafting, it is crucial to maintain proper care in the nursery to ensure successful establishment. This includes regular watering, especially in dry periods, and keeping the area around the graft weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients. Staking may also be necessary to provide support to the young grafts, preventing them	1914	1979.0155
This applies even to the march upon Flodden, for though the Tweed was crossed upon that occasion a day's march up from Berwick, that exception but proves the rule in this sense : that no army in all those centuries attempted to negotiate the formid able obstacle of the Border hills. It is   possible that in the last years of Edward I we should have had a break in so general a sequence of military history, for Edward had summoned his last invading army at Carlisle, but he died before that army could march, and though his heir received Scotch allegiance at Dumfries, upon that western road which with such difficulty outflanks the Border hills of Liddesdale and Cheviot, of Annandale and of Esk, yet there was not at the moment a prosecution of the invasion by so difficult a path; and when, in 1314, the effort was re newed, it was undertaken by the regular eastern road through Berwick.	The strategic importance of the eastern route, with its more manageable terrain and better-established lines of communication, continued to make it the preferred path for military campaigns. These logistical advantages allowed for easier movement of troops and supplies, which was crucial in the often protracted conflicts of the era. The eastern road was not only less physically demanding but also offered more opportunities for provisioning and support from local settlements along the way, which were more accustomed to the passage of armies. Moreover, the eastern route had significant historical and psychological implications. It had been the scene of numerous previous military engagements and carried with it a certain weight of historical precedent. Commanders on both sides of the conflict were well aware of the successes and failures of their predecessors and often planned their strategies around these historical outcomes. In contrast, the western routes, while occasionally used for smaller raids or defensive maneuvers, lacked the infrastructure and support necessary for major invasions. The rugged and remote terrain of the Border hills presented significant challenges, including limited access to food and water, difficulties in navigating the landscape, and the ease with which a small defending force could hold off	1912	1964.1707
Was there a beyond ? — where were they? — those poor ghosts! All the riddles of the eternal Sphinx leapt upon Marcia — riddles at last made real. twenty-four hours ago, two brains, two hearts, alive, furiously alive, with human sorrow and human revolt. And now? Had that infinitely pitiful Christ in whom Newbury believed received the two tormented souls? — were they comforted — purged — absolved ? Had they simply ceased to be — to feel — to suffer? Or did some stern doom await them — still — after all the suffering here?	Such questions surged through her mind as she stood, pale and silent, amidst the shadows of the dimly lit room. The heavy drapes seemed to hold whispered secrets of life and death, the soft ticking of the clock a relentless march of seconds sweeping into the eternity they hinted at. Marcia felt the weight of the unknown pressing upon her, the vast, unanswerable vastness of what might lie beyond the veil of human understanding. Her heart ached with the raw freshness of grief, and yet, amidst the pain, there was a strange curiosity—a longing to know the truth of those eternal mysteries that have perplexed and haunted humanity since the dawn of consciousness. Could there truly be a realm where sorrow and pain were no more, where the injustices of earthly existence were righted in divine recompense? Or was death merely a cessation, a snuffing out of consciousness so complete that there was no 'there' there, beyond the last breath? The idea chilled her, the finality of it more terrifying than any fiery pit or purgatorial limbo. And yet,	1913	1953.9702
Yet few as these are, they are too many to be treated in the pages of a magazine. Accordingly it is only for the sake of illustrating and enforcing principles that examples are adduced. Some idea can be got of their character, however, by the examination of two words, one a noun and the other an adjective. Where an Englishman says autumn, the American generally says fall. Both terms have, indeed, been 7nore or less in use in the two countries: but the frequency of the employment of  270 the latter on this side of the ocean and its infrequency on the other entitle it to the right of being designated as an Americanism. The variation of usage extends even to the meaning. In popular speech autumn comprises in England the months of August, September, and October; in America it comprises September, October, and November.	"Similarly, what is termed 'cider' in America typically refers to what the English would call 'apple juice,' while the English 'cider' is a fermented drink akin to what Americans might label as 'hard cider.' This divergence in terminology reflects not only differences in linguistic evolution but also cultural variations in practice and consumption. Another example can be found in the use of the adjective 'mad.' In British English, 'mad' predominantly means insane or exhibiting wildly irrational behavior. However, in American English, while 'mad' can still mean insane, it is frequently used to express the concept of being angry. Thus, an American saying ""I am mad about what happened"" is likely expressing frustration or anger, whereas a Briton might be suggesting a deeper, more chaotic emotional disturbance.  These nuances of language, while seemingly minor, can lead to significant misunderstandings between speakers from the two nations. They underscore the rich tapestry of English, evolving distinctly in multiple geographies and influenced by a myriad of cultural factors. Such linguistic variations not only enrich the language but also serve as markers of identity and"	1913	2005.5641
But enough of these considerations of the future. It is time that I should relate what I can of the glorious victory which our gallant defenders have torn from the enemy. I do not think that I am giving any information away if I state that the British position lay mainly between Saffron Walden and Royston, the headquarters respectively of the Ilnd and Illrd Army Corps. The ivth Corps was at Baldock, thrown back to cover the left flank, and protect our communications by the Great Northern Railway.	The enemy, primarily composed of formidable continental forces, had advanced with considerable speed towards our lines, their intention clear—to break through our defenses and march directly towards London. However, under the command of General Hargreaves, our troops were well-prepared and strategically positioned to counter any such advancements. The battle commenced at dawn, under a sky heavy with the threat of rain. The enemy initiated the conflict with a fierce artillery barrage, which our batteries answered with equal vigor. For hours, the air was filled with the deafening roars of cannon and the sharp cracks of rifle fire. Despite the intensity of the enemy's initial assault, our lines held firm, anchored by the steadfastness of the II and III Corps. As the day wore on, the IVth Corps played a crucial role. Observing a weakening in the enemy’s right flank, General Hargreaves ordered a bold maneuver. With precision and daring, the IVth Corps swept forward, executing a flanking movement that caught the enemy by surprise. This action threw the enemy into disarray, and their formation began to fal	1906	1892.0387
The pastures were brown and parched for lack of rain, the donkey paths knee deep with dust, and in the bare untraveled spots the earth was cracked wide open with the heat. Having accomplished the seventeen miles in a little more than an hour's time, we drew proudly into the station at Barranquilla, and I was cast forth into a dense crowd of negroes, Indians, and half breeds, each with some sort, of conveyance and each determined to carry some portion of me away with him. Not many years back Barranquilla was a native village of mud and thatch, naked children and semi naked adults, pigs and filth and evil smells. today, through the influence of foreign capital and a slowly reviving commerce, it has grown to a position of some importance.	The streets, once mere tracks in the dirt, are now paved and lined with buildings of a more permanent construction—brick and stone replacing the primitive thatch. Electric lights have replaced the old oil lamps, casting a modern glow over the faces of the town's diverse population. The market, which was once a chaotic sprawl of vendors, has been organized into a more structured space, with sections for different goods—fruits, vegetables, meats, and textiles.  Commerce buzzes more vigorously than ever, with shops boasting goods from Europe and North America alongside local crafts and produce. The wharf, once a rickety structure where small fishing boats jostled for space, has been expanded to accommodate larger vessels, facilitating the export of local products like coffee, bananas, and sugar. The influx of foreign traders and investors has brought a cosmopolitan flair to the town, with cafes and restaurants offering a taste of distant lands.  Yet, despite these advancements, Barranquilla retains much of its original character. The vibrant cultural mix of its inhabitants continues to color the town with a lively	1913	1986.9054
But his scouts had reported a lock and wooden footbridge immediately to the westward between Harlow and Sawbridgeworth, just abreast of the large wooded park surrounding Pishobury House on the farther side. He determined to send two companies over by this, their movements being hidden from the English by the trees. After crossing, they found themselves confronted by a backwater, but, trained in crossing rivers, they managed to ford and swim over, and advanced through the park towards Harlow Bridge. While this was in progress, a large force was reported marching south on the Cambridge Road. While Von der Rudesheim, who was at the western end of Sheering hamlet, was looking through his glasses  at the new arrivals on the scene of action — who were without doubt the main body of the Royston command, which was retiring under the personal supervision of Lord Byfield — a puff of white smoke rose above the trees about Hyde Hall, and at top speed four heavily loaded trains shot into sight going south.	The German commander quickly realized the strategic implications of this new development. The trains, brimming with troops and supplies, indicated a significant mobilization of the English forces, possibly preparing for a larger counteroffensive. This meant that his window for gaining a decisive advantage was rapidly closing. Von der Rudesheim urgently dispatched a messenger to his rear command, ordering the immediate advancement of reserves to bolster his position and prepare for an escalated engagement. Meanwhile, his two companies, having successfully navigated the park's terrain and the backwater, were now stealthily approaching Harlow Bridge. The bridge was crucial for controlling the local road network and would provide a significant tactical advantage. However, as they neared, the sound of marching boots and clanking equipment grew louder — it was clear that an English contingent was already positioned there. The Germans quickened their pace, moving into formation for a surprise assault. As they readied their rifles and prepared to emerge from the cover of the last line of trees, a sharp command halted them. Von der Rudesheim, ever cautious, had caught up to the v	1906	1980.7904

This institution is intended to be the fiscal agent of the government and to do business all over the world. Its speculations are not to be confined to Wall Street, but to extend to London, Paris Amsterdam, Berlin and other rich cities. And the government, that is, all the people, is to guarantee the payment of all the notes issi ed by all thece banks of issue. The frame work of this mighty structure is already set up. The chief genius back of it is J. Pierpont Morgan, the great trust promoter.	He, along with other financial magnates, has been instrumental in orchestrating this bold venture, aiming to consolidate monetary influence and extend its reach globally. The idea is to create a centralized yet expansive system that not only stabilizes the domestic economy but also positions it as a pivotal player in international finance. The institution is designed to wield considerable power, managing large-scale transactions and influencing economic policies across borders. This novel approach to banking is seen by many as a necessary evolution in the face of burgeoning global markets and increasingly interconnected economies. Critics, however, voice concerns over the potential for excessive centralization of financial power and the risks inherent in extending government guarantees to such a vast and varied array of international activities. They argue that the safety nets provided could encourage reckless speculation, leading to situations where taxpayers might ultimately bear the burden of imprudent financial decisions made on a global scale. Nevertheless, the supporters of this initiative argue that with stringent oversight and robust regulatory frameworks, the benefits—enhanced economic stability, more efficient markets, and strengthened international financial relationships—far outweigh the potential risks. They envision a future where this	1911	2007.3635
"Here we have a really reformative system with a partially indeterminate sentence. Some prisoners have to be discharged unreformed when their maximum sentence expires. The Indiana Reformatory Act of 1897 establishes the Indiana Reformatory for male prisoners found guilty of felony, other than treason or murder in the first or second degree, between the ages of 16 and 30. The Court are to name the crime and the prisoner's age, and to sentence him to the custody of the Board of Managers of the Reformatory "" for a term not less than the minimum time prescribed by the statutes of the State, as a punishment for such offence, and not more than the maximum time prescribed by such statutes therefore."" "" The Board of Managers may terminate such imprisonment when the rules and requirements of such Reformatory have been lived up to and fulfilled according to the provisions of this act."""	This provision allows for a degree of flexibility and individual assessment that is markedly different from the more rigid sentencing frameworks commonly in place. The goal here is evidently rehabilitative rather than merely punitive; the system is designed to encourage rehabilitation through compliance with reformatory regulations and programs. The indeterminate sentence structure provides the necessary incentive for inmates to engage positively with these rehabilitative opportunities, as their release depends not solely on the passage of time but on demonstrable personal development and reform. The practical application of this act requires the Board of Managers to closely monitor the progress of each inmate, assessing their behavior, participation in programs such as education and vocational training, and overall readiness for reintroduction into society. This approach is grounded in the belief that many criminals, especially younger ones, are capable of significant personal change if provided with the appropriate environment and support. Moreover, this system places a significant responsibility on the Reformatory's staff to not only enforce discipline but also to provide genuine opportunities for growth and reform. The staff must act as both supervisors and mentors, a dual role that demands a high level of professional commitment and	1908	2005.8439
It is not maintained that criminal statistics are adverse to a belief in the freedom of the will, but it is held that the testimony of these statistics goes to show that the determinations of the will operate within a narrower range than is commonly supposed. Notwithstanding the fact that punishment seems to have so little effect upon the total volume of serious crime, it would be hazardous, and in fact unjustifiable, to assert that it has no effect at all. All that we can really infer from the regularity with which  a certain number of serious offences are committed from year to year is that there exists a certain section of the population who are not deterred from committing these offences by the terrors of the criminal law. We do not know the number of persons who may possibly be deterred from committing crime by the probability that they will be punished for it.	Moreover, the influence of punishment on crime rates must be considered not only in terms of its deterrent effect but also in its potential for rehabilitation and societal reformation. It is possible that the steady rate of serious crimes recorded annually may reflect the constant proportion of the population that, due to various socio-economic and psychological factors, remains vulnerable to criminal behaviors despite the punitive measures. This does not necessarily negate the effectiveness of the criminal justice system but rather highlights the complexity of criminal behavior and its roots. The regularity observed in crime statistics may also suggest the need for a more nuanced approach to law enforcement and penal reform. Perhaps a combination of punitive measures with more robust social support systems, educational opportunities, and mental health services would address not only the symptoms but the underlying causes of criminal behavior. This holistic approach could potentially reduce the base rate of those predisposed to commit serious offenses, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the criminal justice system in promoting societal safety and harmony.	1908	2002.8776
Social organisation even finds room for the ungifted. What is needed is only a most careful insight into the variations. The teacher who ignores this manifoldness of dispositions and works with an abstract scheme of human nature must be handicapped in his best efforts. A certain amount of individualization is therefore a wholesome demand of modern pedagogy, provided that it is not misunderstood to be a mere yielding to the personal likings of the child. The adjustment to the individual variations ought to secure on the one side the fullest possible development of personal gifts in the interest of the individual and of the community. It ought to provide, on the other side, the best possible stimulation of those mental functions which nature has neglected in the particular case.	This balance is crucial in fostering an environment where each child can thrive and contribute to society in their unique way. The teacher's role becomes that of a skilled gardener, who must know the specific conditions under which each plant flourishes best. Just as the gardener does not force a fern to thrive in the sun, the educator must not impose a uniform method of learning on all students. Instead, they must cultivate a flexible educational framework, one that adapts to the needs and potentials of each student. Furthermore, this approach does not merely cater to the academic strengths of students but also considers their emotional and social growth. It is essential that the educational system does not just produce scholars but well-rounded individuals who are emotionally intelligent and socially competent. This comprehensive development ensures that each individual not only succeeds personally but also contributes effectively to the societal fabric. Ultimately, the goal of education should be to equip each child with the tools necessary to navigate and improve the world, recognizing their individual talents and compensating for their weaker areas. This requires a deep understanding of each child's unique psychological makeup and a commitment to fostering	1909	2006.3821
"When Hamlet attacks the King, he draws his sword and defends himself and is killed in the rencounter. Laertes and Hamlet die of their mutual wounds. .. . The people soon called for Hamlet as it had been acted from time immemorial. ""l The two Shakespearean parts which Garrick made especially his own were Richard III. and Lear; but it should not be forgotten that he never played them according to the poet's original conception. He always presented Richard in the horrible mixture we owe to Colley Gibber, and of which half comes from that scribbler's inkpot or has been looted by him from other plays of Shakespeare's.3 The tent scene has notably suffered from Gibber's emendations; the primitive version is much more effective."	Lear too was subjected to significant alterations under Garrick's direction, with Nahum Tate's adaptation being the preferred version, rather than Shakespeare's original text. This version, infamous for its happy ending, sees Cordelia surviving and being restored to the throne alongside Edgar, rather than the tragic finale penned by Shakespeare. Such changes were made to cater to the tastes of the 18th-century audience, who often favored more optimistic outcomes and were less receptive to the bleakness of Shakespeare’s original endings. Garrick's influence was such that these altered versions remained the standard for many years, with the true Shakespearean renditions not seeing a revival until well into the 19th century. This practice of adaptation was not limited to Garrick or to the plays of Shakespeare; it was a common feature of theatrical productions of the time, which often prioritized audience appeal over textual fidelity. Yet, despite these deviations, Garrick's performances were celebrated for their emotional depth and dramatic vigor, securing his reputation as one of the most illustrious actors of his day.	1912	1982.0438
In order to ascertain whether the same effects were produced when the air in the connecting pipe was at atmospheric pressure instead of the pressure given by the gasometer immediately prior to the admission of air in an overran experiment, some tests were carried out in which the rubber tube connecting the gasometer to the pipe was held blocked and suddenly released in order to admit the pressure to the recording apparatus. This method approximates more closely to the conditions met with in practice when a sudden rise of wind occurs, than does the method of turning the tap at the bottom of the pipe to admit air to the recorder. It was, however, found that with 30 feet of lead pipe between the gasometer and recording apparatus there was no difference between the amounts of overrun recorded by the two methods, so that the method adopted may be regarded as satisfactory. - The figures given in the tables were each deduced from several determinations.	The average overrun recorded was 2.3%, with a standard deviation of 0.5%, indicating a consistent and reliable measurement across all tests conducted. Furthermore, to verify the repeatability of these results, the experiment was replicated under varying environmental conditions and using different lengths of connecting pipes. Variations in temperature and humidity were introduced to simulate the possible range of atmospheric conditions that might be encountered. Despite these modifications, the results remained within a narrow margin of error, reinforcing the robustness of the experimental setup and methodology. Additional experiments were conducted to explore the effect of varying the diameter of the connecting pipes. It was hypothesized that a wider diameter could potentially reduce the resistance to air flow, thereby affecting the overrun measurements. Results from these tests showed a slight decrease in overrun percentage with increased pipe diameter, suggesting that the dynamics of air flow indeed play a role in the measurement process. These findings have significant implications for the design and operation of gas delivery systems, particularly in scenarios where precise control of gas flow is critical. The ability to predict and account for gas overrun can lead to more efficient system designs	1912	1980.4213
""" Well, Mrs. Challen, "" I said, "" please understand that if either of those people calls again, I am not at home."" "" Certainly, sir, "" she answered with great alacrity, as she went out of the room. It was no mere excuse, but perfectly correct, when I told those people I had an important engagement to attend to. An old friend of mine, Sir Lockesley Halley, was President of the Dedling tonian Astronomical Society, and, after hearing my account of Mars, said he would be very glad if I could attend the meeting of his Society on the following evening and give a short address on the subject."	As a keen amateur astronomer with a particular interest in the celestial bodies, the invitation was one I could scarcely refuse. Sir Lockesley had been a mentor to me in my early days of stargazing and his opinion still held considerable sway in my decisions about public appearances. The prospect of speaking at such a distinguished gathering was both an honor and a formidable challenge. I spent the rest of the afternoon in my study, poring over my notes and observations of Mars, ensuring that every detail was precise and every conclusion well-supported. The peculiarities of its atmosphere, the speculation about its canals, and the recent opposition that brought Mars closer to Earth than it had been in nearly a decade—all these points had to be woven into a coherent and engaging presentation. As evening approached, I meticulously prepared my visual aids, which included detailed maps of Mars and diagrams of its orbital mechanics. I knew the members of the Dedlingtonian Astronomical Society were a discerning audience, many of them skilled astronomers in their own right, and it was crucial to present information that was not only accurate but also	1911	1906.6256

The corporation’s designated representative shall have access to the work site at all reasonable times	1913	1909.3679
"""Elevation to the bench does not necessarily free them of their prejudices, and if the prejudices should be such as to prevent them from rendering justice to the public, the public should have the unquestioned right to recall them. ""Very often the disqualification of a Judge could not be known to the public until after he had given an exhibition of his unfitness by some act on the bench. As such unfitness was unknown at the time of his election or appointment, the public's only remedy in such a case could be the recall."" Judge Gorman is distinguished as the only man on the Bench in Hamilton County, Ohio, by whom George Boss Cox, indicted for perjury, was afraid to be tried. Governor Wilson on the Initiative and Referendum ""I tell you, "" said Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey, as reported by Mr. Hale, in the May World's Work, ""the people of this state and this country are determined at last to take over the control of their own politics. We are going to cut down the jungle in which corruption lurks. We are going to drag things into the light, break down private understandings and force them to be public understandings."	"We are going to insist that every public servant answers directly to the people. If he fails in his duty, the people must have the power to remove him, not after long years of damage, but promptly."" Governor Wilson's voice grew more intense as he spoke, reflecting the fervor of his commitment to these reforms. ""The initiative and referendum,"" he continued, ""are not merely tools for more direct democracy. They are safeguards against the entrenchment of power. They are checks on those who would use public office for private gain rather than for the public good. They ensure that the ultimate authority in a democracy—the people—have the means to express their will directly, bypassing the filters and distortions of intermediaries."" As the room filled with applause, Governor Wilson paused, allowing his words to resonate. He looked around, his gaze meeting those of his listeners, reinforcing his message of empowerment and responsibility. ""This,"" he declared, ""is the essence of self-government. This is how we restore faith in our political system. By making it more transparent, more accountable, and more responsive to"	1911	1959.7136
"The english speaking pure mathematicians constitute more nearly a terra incognita than the workers in any other large field of knowledge. This is partly due to the nature of the subject and partly to the fact that there are so few mathematical works of reference in the English language. There never has been a good mathematical encyclopaedia or other work of general reference in this language, while the French and Germans have had several such works in addition to the great encyclopaedias which are now in the process of publication. All large mathematical histories have appeared in foreign languages. ""New International Encyclopaedia (1904), under ""Substitutions."""	The scarcity of comprehensive English mathematical literature not only hinders the spread of knowledge within the field but also isolates English-speaking mathematicians from their international colleagues. The consequence is a kind of intellectual insularity, where ideas and methodologies that are common place in other parts of the world may remain little known in English-speaking countries. This gap is particularly evident in the more abstract realms of pure mathematics, where the language and concepts are already highly specialized and the need for clear, accessible exposition is paramount. Moreover, the lack of reference materials in English forces many budding mathematicians in English-speaking countries to learn additional languages or to struggle with translations that may not fully capture the nuances of the original works. This extra barrier can discourage many potential talents from entering or persisting in the field. Efforts to bridge this gap have included translations of major works and the sporadic publication of comprehensive texts and monographs in English. However, these are often not enough to fully integrate the English-speaking mathematical community with their international peers. The development of a robust, English-language mathematical encyclopedia or a series of comprehensive reference texts could significantly alter	1911	1977.2242
After him followed the clergy, then the people, to offer this same token of homage to their crucified Lord. All the while this kissing of the cross was going on, the choir sang the 'pp. 86, 89. 'Also, Concordia 2. 76 ff. (cf. Durand, Rationale 6. 77. 21, p. 229) and 182, 184 ff., 385, 66s, 735. 833, 870, 895; Durham Ritual 93- 150-  anthems — Ecce lignum crucis, Crucem tuam adoramus, Dim Fabricator mundi, and the hymn Pange, lingua. '	The solemnity of the ceremony was palpable, as the ancient melodies filled the air, weaving an atmosphere of reverence and awe. Each participant approached with a mixture of humility and devotion, their eyes often lowered in contemplation or brimming with tears of piety. As the last notes of Pange, lingua faded, the congregation observed a moment of deep, collective silence, a profound pause that seemed to connect each soul present with the sacred history they were commemorating. The service continued with the reading of the Passion, according to St. John, which was chanted in a stark, plaintive tone by two deacons. The congregation stood, listening intently, as the story of suffering and ultimate sacrifice unfolded. The narrative, though familiar, struck a fresh chord each year, reminding all of the immense love and mercy that formed the foundation of their faith. As the reading concluded, the priest delivered a brief homily, emphasizing the virtues of sacrifice, love, and redemption. He spoke of the cross not only as a symbol of pain and defeat but as an emblem of victory and hope	1904	1945.1793
But she said she did not feel like walking, and that ended the discussion. Later on when we stopped to rest again and Noashak started her old tactics of running uphill and sliding down, I again suggested to her father that she might rest while we rested and then she would no doubt feel like walking when we started travelling again. He put the case to her as before. Evidently his sympathies were on my side and he was as anxious to have her walk as I was, but her curt decision that she would rather slide downhill than walk beside the sled settled the matter. I am unable to remember now whether I had any theory by which I explained to myself why it was that Noashak was never forbidden anything and never punished, but I know now that if I had a theory it must have been a wrong one.	For as I look back with the clearer understanding of years and the accumulated observations of a lifetime, I see that Noashak's father was guided by a philosophy of gentle persuasion rather than strict discipline. He seemed to believe that the natural inclinations of a child, if not harmful, should be allowed to express themselves freely, that the spirit of a child was something to be nurtured rather than molded. This approach, while it may have appeared as indulgence or lack of control to an outsider, was in fact a deliberate choice to foster independence and self-regulation in Noashak.  His method was to suggest rather than to impose, to guide rather than to dictate. It was clear that he respected his daughter's preferences and choices, even in something as simple as her method of moving along the snowy landscape. This respect for her autonomy, I came to realize, was a profound expression of his love and trust in her ability to make decisions for herself. This realization has since influenced my own views on parenting and authority, showing me the strength and wisdom that can come from a less authoritarian approach	1913	1940.3959
True, the City stood for commerce, for material wealth, financial greatness, and Westminster for sacred traditions and for governing powers, when this was but a country village. Yet when the Reformation closed the story of Westminster as a mediaeval cloister of thought, the history of Chelsea opened, as its Renaissance equivalent or analogue, and as since affording once and again some needed subjective counterpart to the material and political greatness of the two metropolitan cities. In many ways, of course, this position, while here in Chelsea but individually and sporadically realised, has been more fully and more consciously taken as well as educationally applied by Oxford, but while that has been mainly a citadel of the causes and ideals of the past, the record of Chelsea, as we have seen, lies essentially in its initiatives of new ideals, of constructive .movements.	Its spirit has been one of intellectual ferment and artistic innovation, where thinkers, writers, and artists have sought refuge and inspiration away from the bustling economic heart of London. This small enclave has historically been a crucible for cultural transformation, a place where the avant-garde could thrive and where the boundaries of conventional thought were continually challenged and expanded. Chelsea's contribution to the arts and sciences is substantial, mirroring the evolution of modern thought and aesthetics. From the Pre-Raphaelites to the modernists of the 20th century, Chelsea has consistently nurtured talents that have gone on to redefine their respective fields. The area's scenic beauty along the Thames provided not only physical but also metaphorical distance from the commercial pressures and societal norms that governed the more central parts of London. Moreover, Chelsea has been a hub for progressive social theories and political movements. It has attracted a community of reformers, radicals, and intellectuals who have played pivotal roles in shaping public opinion and policy on issues ranging from women's rights to social justice. The salons, cafes, and studios of Chelsea have been meeting places where	1908	2007.2649
"The Literary Digest gives some striking figures on this score. One advertiser inserted a full page advertisement in the Digest. Four thousand replies were received, each with a two cent stamp affixed (first class mail). Each inquirer  228 was sent six different letters known as ""follow ups"" and six different circulars. Four hundred sets of books were ordered, to be paid for in monthly instalments. Each monthly payment required a notice, a reply and a receipt. Moreover, two thirds of the book purchasers made remittance by means of postal money orders. All this revenue to the government resulted from advertising carried as second class matter. It is plain that the postal deficit cannot be wiped out by increasing the rate on second class matter. It has been substantially reduced by overworking em ployes, but would it not be much more to the credit of the Department to force the railroads to handle the mail on something bordering on a just and equitable basis?"	The argument that the postal service is a drain on the treasury due to the low rates charged for second class mail is thus demonstrably flawed. Advertising, which primarily utilizes this rate, indirectly generates substantial first class mail through responses and follow-up communications. This cycle not only increases the volume of higher-rate mail but also supports a broader economic activity that benefits multiple sectors, including the postal service itself. Furthermore, the focus on increasing rates for second class mail overlooks the potential efficiencies and savings that could be achieved through better negotiations and contracts with the railroads. The current arrangements often favor the railroads excessively, placing an undue burden on the postal system. Addressing this imbalance could lead to significant cost reductions and better service, contributing to the financial health of the postal system without the need to increase rates. It is clear that a more holistic approach to postal economics is required—one that considers the interconnectedness of mail types and the broader implications of postal logistics. By fostering fairer transportation costs and optimizing the existing rate structure, the postal service can enhance its sustainability without compromising service or overburdening any particular category	1911	1991.111
MR. F. W. WILLCOX was glad that bad examples of lighting had been shown as well as good, because it was only by studying the former that the requirements of really good lighting could be discovered. The need of the illuminating engineer was clearly shown all through the papers, and the case cited by Mr. Eck, of greatly improved light due to the use of proper reflectors, was only one of many. There was a general lack of knowledge with respect to reflectors. The value of indirect arc lighting had been clearly demonstrated, but he would remind Mr. Eck that there was no reason why the same effect should not be obtained with glow lamps on the indirect system.	"Mr. Willcox continued by emphasizing the importance of understanding the distribution of light and the role of reflectors in achieving optimal illumination. He noted that too often, spaces were either overlit or underlit due to improper placement and selection of reflectors and lamps. He argued for a more scientific approach in the selection of lighting equipment, one that considers the specific needs of the environment being lit. ""The principles of photometry should be more widely understood among those responsible for lighting installations,"" Mr. Willcox asserted. ""By measuring light levels and understanding the distribution patterns, we can create more efficient and pleasing environments."" He also pointed out the advancements in electric lamp technology, suggesting that the future of lighting lay in the development and adoption of more efficient, adjustable, and durable lighting solutions. ""The potential for energy saving and improved visual comfort is enormous, provided that we continue to educate and innovate in the field of illumination engineering,"" he concluded. Mr. Willcox's remarks were well-received, sparking a lively discussion among the conference attendees about the need for better educational resources for those working in lighting design and installation"	1912	2006.7894
The gravamen of the charge against the regular school does not lie in the empiricism or theoretical character of medical practice, but in the fact that with a practice that is so thoroughly theoretical in character, it should seek by law to check free and untrammelled investigation by those who do not accept its general theories as necessarily embodying the truth, and to outlaw new schools of practice and methods of cure whose success lies wholly in the fact that in a free field the new practises and methods have proved more successful than the regular practice. Is Present day Medical Practice Scientific? But to advance a step. It is claimed that modern discoveries have revolutionised medical theories and that now it is certain that through proper sanitation and medical treatment hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved.	Indeed, the introduction of germ theory and advancements in bacteriology have provided a scientific basis for many treatments that were once based purely on speculation. Vaccination, antiseptic techniques in surgery, and the use of antibiotics have all contributed significantly to the reduction of mortality rates from infectious diseases. Yet, the question remains whether these practices, grounded as they are in scientific research, represent the entirety of what medicine can or should be. Critics argue that the reliance on pharmaceutical interventions may neglect the holistic aspects of health, such as the psychological, social, and environmental factors that contribute to illness. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement in medicine often outstrips the ethical considerations necessary to ensure these technologies are used judiciously. The integration of technology in medical practice, while beneficial, also raises issues of accessibility and equity, as not all populations have equal access to the latest treatments. Moreover, the push for evidence-based medicine, while scientifically sound, sometimes dismisses traditional practices and alternative medicines that do not conform to conventional research paradigms but have shown efficacy through centuries of use. This tension between traditional	1911	2001.9872
After the vines are thus pruned, the outer end of each arm is firmly tied to the lower wire, along which it is gently coiled. These two ties hold the vine firmly in place. The buds on the arms push and ascend, passing over the lateral wires, clinging thereto with their tendrils and hang over like a beautiful green drapery, shading the fruit and body of the vine according to its natural habit. Buds that push on the body of the vine are rubbed off as they appear, and after blooming the tips of all the bearing shoots are clipped off with a quick stroke of a sharp knife. This causes the growth to concentrate in the fruit, greatly increasing the size of the berries.	As the season progresses and the clusters begin to form and swell, careful attention must be paid to thinning. Overcrowded bunches are meticulously thinned out to ensure that air and sunlight can reach each berry, which helps in the prevention of disease and promotes even ripening. Leaves that shade the clusters too much are also selectively removed, but with caution to avoid exposing the fruit to harsh sunlight which can cause sunburn. Irrigation, too, must be managed with precision. Vines require a consistent amount of moisture for optimal growth, but overwatering can lead to diluted flavors in the grapes and increase the risk of fungal diseases. The soil moisture levels are regularly checked, and water is applied judiciously to maintain the delicate balance required for premium fruit development. As harvest approaches, the watchful grower tests the sugar, acid, and tannin levels of the grapes to determine the perfect time for picking. Each variety has its specific indicators for maturity, and the exact timing can vary from year to year depending on weather conditions. The goal is to harvest the grapes at their peak	1914	2006.4691

In the case of a breach, where the employer refuses to utilize the architect’s services as agreed upon, the architect may seek remedy through the courts for losses incurred. This was affirmed in the case of Hargreaves v.

It has become absolutely invisible. If the microscope you are using is a powerful one, this means that there remains no particle of the salt of the sizo of one hundred thousandth of an inch. In point of fact, the portion of salt has now been separated into molecules so small that many millions of them must be massed together to form the smallest visible particle of matter. These molecules are moving about freely in the solution among the molecules of water. Individually they are so small that they do not obstruct the light waves; hence Ihe transparency of the solution of which they now form a part. But if you were to thrust a platinum wire into the solution and then hold though wire in the flame of a Bunsen gas burner, the flame will instantly take on a peculiar green colour which proves to the discerning eye that the particles of salt have been rendered luminous. If this green flame is examined through a spectroscope, the rays of light coming from it will be observed to be split up into a characteristic series of lines.	These lines, each unique to sodium, reveal the presence of this element in the flame. This phenomenon, known as the flame test, is a classical method used in analytical chemistry to detect and identify elements based on their emission spectrum. Each element emits light at specific wavelengths when excited by heat, producing a spectrum of colored lines that serve as a unique fingerprint. This method, while simple, is a powerful demonstration of how elements interact with energy and emit light—a foundational concept in atomic theory. Further, the spectroscope, an instrument that disperses light into its component colors or wavelengths, allows us to analyze these spectral lines. By comparing the observed lines with known standards, one can identify the elements present. This process not only underscores the discrete nature of atomic emissions but also highlights the interplay between energy and matter at a microscopic scale. Thus, even though the salt appears to vanish in solution, its presence is emphatically declared through the vibrant green of the flame test and the distinct lines in the spectral analysis. Such experiments beautifully illustrate the unseen molecular world and its governance by the laws of physics and chemistry.	1913	2007.3501
It is true that parties may impose as a condition precedent to an application to the courts that they shall ﬁrst have settled the amount to be received by an agreed mode of liquidation or adjustment, and this in many cases provides a much more appropriate tribunal for the purpose than a jury The principle involved in these cases does not close the access of the parties to the courts of law, as the award of the arbiter is only enforceable there.	However, it does require that all preliminary questions as to the amount of damages or the interpretation of contract terms be first resolved through arbitration. This arrangement often expedites the legal process by resolving potentially contentious issues outside of the courtroom, thus saving time and resources for all parties involved. Furthermore, it allows for a specialist in the field relevant to the dispute to make a determination, which can lead to more informed and appropriate outcomes than might be achieved through the generalist knowledge of a jury or judge. Arbitration clauses are common in commercial contracts precisely because they provide a mechanism for resolving disputes that is both efficient and tailored to the specific needs of the industry or parties. These clauses typically specify the rules under which arbitration will be conducted, the method for selecting an arbitrator, and the binding nature of the arbitrator's decision. While this does limit the parties' access to traditional court processes, it is generally seen as a fair trade-off for the benefits of specialized, expedited dispute resolution.	1913	1996.5752
"In short, that our present system of society, whereby part of the people are forced to bear the burdens which should be born by all the people, and many which should not be born at all by any people, is the best that can be devised ? If that is what you believe, I ask you to consider with me for a few moments a small glass factory, located in that Paradise of Capitalism, West Virginia, which I believe demonstrates that you are in error; that workingmen can manage their own industries; that cooperative manufacturing is perfectly feasible; that it is wholly unnecessary that workingmen should part with the greater portion of what they produce to support idle stock and bondholders and high salaried officials. I had heard that down in South Charleston there was a glass factory that was different from other factories. 236 A ""co operative Glass Plant, "" it was called. Just exactly what that meant I did not know, but one afternoon I decided to find out."	"Upon my arrival, I was greeted by Mr. John Harland, a robust man who wore his overalls with a pride that seemed to declare his ownership of not just his attire but of his labor as well. He was one of the worker-owners of this unique establishment. ""As you see,"" Mr. Harland began as we walked through the bustling factory floor, ""we all have a stake in this place. Each of us owns a share of the business, and we vote on major decisions. It's not just about work; it's about building something together, sharing the profits fairly, and making sure everyone's voice is heard."" The air was filled with the clinking sounds of glass being shaped and molded. Workers moved with precision, their faces reflecting a sense of purpose and belonging that was palpable. Unlike other factories I had visited, there was a noticeable absence of hierarchy. The workers communicated freely and there were frequent consultations among them. ""We organize ourselves into committees,"" Mr. Harland explained. ""Each committee deals with different aspects of the business—production, finance, marketing,"	1911	1961.5863

If you consult with this Dance, he will tell you how to pack them for carriage and will choose the prints for me if you are too busy. Pray, dear George, don't neglect this, for I am worried to death about them. I hope you continue well, and make good use of yr Rubbish. Write when you can, and tell Colman not to neglect me. Our love to your babies. Yours ever and most affectionately, D. GAREICK. I find by a Poem of poor Churchill called Y' Candidate, that y town was angry at my leaving them. They must be pleased again.	Yet, it is the nature of public affection to fluctuate, and one must bear these vicissitudes with a steady heart. I trust that with time and continued efforts in the arts, which have always been my true passion, their favor will be regained. It is a curious thing, indeed, how quickly the crowd's love can turn to disapproval, and vice versa. As much as it pains me to be the subject of their discontent, it is a reminder of the transient nature of all worldly esteem. Please ensure that the prints are secured properly, as per Dance's advice. It is most crucial that they arrive in pristine condition, as they are not only valuable in a monetary sense but hold much sentimental value for me. I am particularly eager to see the print from Liotard's work; his skill in capturing the essence of his subjects is unmatched, and I am anxious to see how my own essence has been portrayed through his lens. Remember to keep me informed of any developments, and do not let my requests burden you too heavily. I am ever grateful for your assistance and friendship	1912	1856.7299

"The initial chapter on light and the eye embodies much original work, and the two final chapters on spectacular lighting and "" the illumination of the future "" are most suggestive. The book now contains about 350 pages. It only remains to add that it is written in Dr. Bell's characteristic lucid manner, and should appeal to a wide circle of readers. L'Annuaire International de V Acetylene, 1912 edition. By R. Granjon and Pierre Rosemberg. (Bibliotheque de I'Office Central de Acetylene, 104, Boulevard de Clichy, Paris, fr.) THE ' Annuaire' for 1912, which occupies 360 closely printed and abundantly illustrated pages, again makes interesting reading. As usual, the book contains details of the chief varieties of generators, burners, heating and welding apparatus, c. Some striking data relating to the progress of the industry in France are also given, including a diagram showing the substantial and regular advance in the consumption of carbide in France from 1897 to 1911. There seems little doubt that in France the organisation of the industry has been carried to a fine art. A particularly interesting chapter from our standpoint is that relating to special applications of acetylene."	This chapter delves into the utilization of acetylene beyond basic illumination, exploring its roles in motor vehicle lighting, maritime signal lights, and even in the burgeoning field of aeronautics. The versatility of acetylene as a source of intense, reliable light makes it an invaluable asset in situations requiring portable and dependable lighting solutions. The authors discuss the technical advancements that have allowed for more efficient storage and controlled release of gas, which in turn has broadened the scope of its applications. Furthermore, the book touches upon the safety measures that have been refined over the years, detailing the evolution of safety valves, flashback arrestors, and standardized connectors which have significantly mitigated the risks associated with acetylene use. These enhancements not only increase the safety of operating acetylene equipment but also contribute to the overall efficiency and reliability of the systems. In addition, the 'Annuaire' provides insights into the economic aspects of the acetylene industry, examining production costs, market trends, and the competitive landscape. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the impact of technological innovations on production efficiency and discuss	1912	2006.2483
It was a vision of endless variety and delight. But behind it all, giving life and interest to the scene, was the invisible thought of the desired haven. Whither is she travelling, that long, four masted schooner, with all her sails set to catch the fickle northwest breeze? Is it in some languid bay of the West Indies, or in some rocky harbour of Patagonia, amid the rigours of the far southern winter, that she will cast anchor? Where is she bound, that dark little tramp steamer, trailing voluminous black smoke behind her, and buffeting her way to the eastward in the teeth of the rising gale? Is it in some sunlit port among the bare purple hills of Spain, or in the cool shadows of some forest clad Norwegian fiord, that she will find her moor [6]  ings ? Whither away, ye ships ?	Whither away through the vast, embracing sea, where the horizon bends and whispers secrets of distant lands? Each vessel, a tiny speck against the vastness of the ocean, carries within it the hopes and destinies of those aboard. The schooner, graceful and serene, seems almost to dance upon the waves, her sails billowing like the wings of a great bird. Maybe she seeks the spice-scented air of the East Indies, where the water is a tapestry of vibrant blues and greens, and the sunsets spill gold and crimson across the sky. And the tramp steamer, sturdy and resolute, plows through the waters with a determined air, her smokestacks puffing like the breath of some great beast. Perhaps she heads towards the bustling docks of Shanghai or the misty harbors of London, her hold filled with treasures of the mundane: coal, timber, or the thousand other commodities that pulse through the veins of global commerce.

75. The extent of the experimental work to be carried out in a complete determination is very considerable, and for the present attention is confined to the five more important coefficients abovementioned. In the experiments here described the method of oscillations was used. In employing this method the model is mounted as for an experiment on forces or moments, except that, instead of leaving the balance sensitive to small changes of moment, a powerful spring control is introduced which will maintain oscillations for a period of from 20 to 40 sees, against the damping present due to wind forces and friction in the apparatus. The oscillations are photographically recorded and provide a means of estimating the damping coefficients due to the relative wind, which are the rotary coefficients desired. For the first three of the five important coefficients this is all that is required, but for the two latter it is necessary to produce a forced oscillation of known magnitude about one axis of rotation and to measure the corresponding oscillation about a second axis of rotation.	This measurement allows for the determination of the coupling coefficients, which are crucial for understanding the interaction between different axes during motion. The forced oscillations are typically induced by a motor or a similar mechanical device that can apply a controlled and consistent rotational force to the model. The response of the model to this force, particularly the induced oscillations in the secondary axis, is then carefully monitored and analyzed. The apparatus used for these experiments must be precisely calibrated to ensure that the oscillations induced and measured correspond accurately to the theoretical models. Additionally, the environment in which the experiments are conducted needs to be controlled to minimize external influences that could affect the results, such as air currents or temperature variations. In the analysis phase, the recorded data from the oscillations are processed using mathematical models that describe the dynamic behavior of the system. These models take into account the geometry and physical properties of the model, as well as the aerodynamic forces acting upon it. By fitting the experimental data to these models, the damping and coupling coefficients can be extracted. These coefficients are essential for the design and analysis of aircraft, spacecraft, and	1912	1981.9342

In considering the application of these statutes, courts have historically scrutinized the implications each provision holds towards the interpretation of rights and duties under the law. The referenced case of Jordan, 7 Wall 602, elaborates on the judicial approach to statutory interpretation, emphasizing the necessity to discern legislative intent while respecting the literal text of the law. This principle is crucial in ensuring that legal judgments align with the foundational statutes enacted by the legislature. Furthermore, U.S. Revised Statutes 4888 delineates specific conditions under which legal actions may be initiated, setting a framework that guides both plaintiffs and courts in the administration of justice. This statute, like others, functions as a cornerstone in the structure of federal law, ensuring consistency and predictability in legal proceedings. As we delve into historical cases such as H. 9 Alg:nlR8gvs3n and 1 Man. G. & S. 551, it becomes apparent that the evolution of legal interpretation is deeply influenced by precedent and the continuous refinement of judicial thought. These cases contribute to the rich tapestry of legal jurisprudence,	1913	1998.1942
"The story tells how Psyche and her little sister, Pomander, under trying circumstances battle their way to sticcess. and will interest all who know what it is to cherish ideals which He outside the sphere of their environment, and who ultimately win their own reward. The Marriage of Lenore. ALICE M. DIEHL Author of "" A Mysterious Lover, "" etc. Lenore has married more than once, and thereby hang numerous complications Her first husband is an elderly roue, and the second, who is present at her first marriage, restores to her the bouquet which she drops, and in this act and its recognition eyes and «ouls meet. There is a rumour that the first husband was a bigamist. Thereupon Lenore marries her second, only to find that her first husband's mesalliance was no mar: age and that she herself has committed bigamy."	The ensuing scandal and the social ostracism that follow are harrowing, yet Lenore's spirit remains unbroken. Desperate to clear her name and restore her reputation, she seeks legal counsel, embarking on a tumultuous journey through the complexities of the law, driven by the hope of annulling her unintended bigamous union. Amidst the legal battles, Lenore's relationship with her second husband grows strained, their initial connection overshadowed by the looming shadow of her past mistakes. As Lenore navigates through the trials, both legal and personal, she discovers layers of deceit and manipulation that her first husband had woven around her life. The revelation of his true character and the uncovering of his other illicit activities bring a new perspective to Lenore's plight, offering a glimmer of vindication. With the support of her second husband, who stands by her side despite the societal judgment and personal doubts, Lenore fights to reclaim her life and identity. The resolution comes with bittersweet triumph as the courts finally recognize the invalidity of her first marriage, freeing her from the chains	1912	2007.7621
It led to his appointment at once as professor of chemistry in the college of Dijon. Finding that the duties of this position consumed all his time in teaching, he asked the government for a transfer to some place which would admit of his going on with research. Quite unexpectedly to himself, he was sent at the beginning of 1849 to the University of Strasburg to relieve Bersoz, professor of chemistry there, who desired to go to Paris. Realising fully the value of the vein he had discovered in tartaric acids, he directed his energies along that line. He had found out what para tartaric, or racemic, acid is; but neither he nor any one else knew  its origin. He now undertook the discovery of this.	As he delved deeper into his research on tartaric acids, Pasteur became increasingly fascinated by the molecular asymmetry that separated para tartaric acid from its more common counterpart. This line of inquiry not only promised to shed light on the mysterious origins of racemic acid but also to challenge the existing understanding of molecular structures and their impact on chemical properties.  Pasteur's work at Strasburg was rigorous and demanding. He spent long hours in the laboratory, often working late into the night, meticulously documenting his experiments and observations. His approach was methodical and precise, reflecting his deep commitment to the scientific method. The breakthrough came after months of intense study and experimentation. Pasteur succeeded in demonstrating that racemic acid was a mixture of two different optical isomers, or mirror-image forms, of tartaric acid. This discovery was pivotal, not only in explaining the origin of racemic acid but also in establishing the fundamental principle of molecular chirality— the idea that certain molecules exist in two forms that are mirror images of each other, much like left and right hands. This principle had	1911	2007.6919
"The Senate of the United States on August 8th passed the House resolution providing for the admission of Arizona and New Mexico into the Union as states. The amendment  Direct Legislation 571 striking from the Arizona constitution the provision for the recall of judges was voted down after senators had expressed themselves as opposed to this special feature of the document. Nine regular Republicans joined eleven insurgents and thirty-three Democrats to make the fifty-three for the measure, while only fifteen regulars were mustered against it. The bill as passed requires a referendum on the proposition to recall judges. ""The story of Oregon for the last ten years is simply a story of the shifting of political power from the corporations, which had abused it for so many years, to the farmers, the small merchants and the working classes, "" says Burton J. Hendrick, in the August issue of McClure""s Magazine."	This transformation has been largely effected through the mechanism of direct legislation. The initiative and referendum have been utilized to pass laws that directly benefit these groups, often bypassing the state legislature where corporate interests previously held significant sway. The process allows citizens to propose and vote on legislation directly, thus democratizing the law-making process and enabling grassroots movements to challenge the entrenched power of corporate lobbyists. As a result, Oregon has seen a number of progressive measures enacted, including laws regulating working conditions, setting minimum wage standards, and protecting natural resources from exploitation. The shift towards direct democracy in Oregon represents a significant change in the balance of political power, empowering ordinary citizens at the expense of previously dominant corporate entities. This trend in Oregon reflects a broader movement across the United States towards greater use of direct democracy as a tool to combat corporate influence and restore power to the people. As more states observe the successful implementation of such measures in Oregon, it is likely that the use of direct legislation will continue to spread, reshaping the American political landscape in favor of the wider populace.	1911	2001.8313
"Growth in population depends on the death rate as well as on the birthrate. Malthusians assume that the birth rate increases with an increase of food — the opposite effect is the law of Nature. In 1841 Doubleday wrote his book, "" The True Law of Population, "" advancing the proposition that the fecundity of human animals, and all other living beings, is in inverse proportion to the quantity of nutriment, that an underfed population multiplies rapidly, but all classes in comfortable circumstances are by a physiological law so unprolific as seldom to keep up their numbers without being recruited from the poorer classes. The birth rate in Ireland was never so great as immediately after the great famine, and the same result attends periodical famines in 'India. Half a million more children were born in Bengal in 1899 than in 1898. The poorest London districts have a birth rate of 35-6, compared with 18.6 in the wealthiest districts."	"This phenomenon, often referred to as the ""Doubleday effect,"" suggests that socioeconomic conditions significantly influence reproductive patterns. It is a compelling argument against the simplistic Malthusian view that population growth is merely a function of food availability. Instead, it underscores the complex interplay of economic stability, nutritional adequacy, and reproductive health. Furthermore, historical data supports the notion that during times of economic hardship, families might have more children partly due to lower access to contraception and education. Conversely, in more affluent societies, where education and access to health services are better, birth rates tend to decrease. This trend is observable not only in the historical context of Ireland and India but is also evident in contemporary demographic studies across various nations. The implications of these findings are profound, especially for policy-making in areas of public health, education, and economic development. It suggests that improving the overall socioeconomic status of a population could be more effective in stabilizing population growth than measures solely aimed at increasing food supply. This approach requires a holistic understanding of the factors that contribute to fertility rates, including education, health services,"	1911	2007.1573
Rep. 402. Rep. 402. §20.j 15 LAW OF (JONTRAOTS.	The law of contracts is fundamentally concerned with the enforcement of promises. It requires, for the formation of a legally binding contract, that there be an offer by one party and an acceptance by another, along with consideration, which refers to something of value being exchanged between the contracting parties. Additionally, both parties must have the capacity to enter into a contract, and the contract itself must be for a lawful purpose. In more detail, the essential elements to evaluate in any contract situation include: mutuality of obligation, where both parties are bound by the obligations; intent to create legal relations, typically presumed in commercial dealings; and certainty of terms, meaning the agreement must not be too vague. Contracts can be oral or written, although certain types of contracts, such as those involving the sale of real estate or contracts that cannot be performed within one year, must be in writing under the statute of frauds. A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to fulfill their part of the bargain as agreed in the contract. Remedies for breach include damages, specific performance, or rescission of the contract. It is	1913	1930.434
Take the velocity of the ring as unity and m — y. 13. The cast iron cylindrical case of a friction clutch is 19 inches internal diameter and J inch thick. The internal radial pressure of the friction blocks on the case is 80 lbs. per square inch, and the case makes about its axis 500 revolutions per minute. Estimate the greatest intensity of tensile stress in the material of the case, which may be taken as a thin shell. Weight of cast iron o-26 lb. per cubic inch. Y  CHAPTER XII. 129.	To determine the greatest intensity of tensile stress in the material of the case, we first need to calculate the hoop stress, which is the stress exerted circumferentially in the wall of the cylindrical case due to the internal pressure from the friction blocks. Given: - Internal diameter (D) = 19 inches - Thickness of the case (t) = 0.5 inches - Internal radial pressure (P) = 80 lbs. per square inch The formula to calculate the hoop stress (\(\sigma\)) in a thin cylindrical shell subjected to internal pressure is: \[ \sigma = \frac{P \times D}{2t} \] Plugging in the values: \[ \sigma = \frac{80 \times 19}{2 \times 0.5} = \frac{1520}{1} = 1520 \text{ lbs per square inch} \] Therefore, the greatest intensity of tensile stress in the material of the case is approximately 1520 psi. This calculation assumes the shell behavior is ideal and thin-w	1908	1981.8783

Is it not time that curators and sociologists were joining hands to discuss methods as well as to collect materials, and thus in fact form in and for each particular city, as well as in the greater centres — say the three national capitals at least, and perhaps also the main regional ones — a Cities Survey Committee. II. Next, since there is to be a section of Social Science in the approaching Franco british Exhibition 1908, may we not at once widen our proposed cooperation a step farther? Given Museum and Libraries, with collections illustrative of the past  of their cities, of their present, and sometimes even of the incipient future, might they not send the Franco british Exhibition a characteristic exhibit, condensing this threefold view of their towns? French cities , too, would generously respond, even with a greater wealth of interesting matter than our British industrial cities can as yet supply.	III. Such an exhibit could serve as a microcosm of urban development and societal dynamics, showcasing not only the architectural and historical evolution of these cities but also their cultural, economic, and social transformations. This would provide a tangible, comparative insight that could greatly enhance our understanding of urban life and its challenges across different regions and periods. IV. Furthermore, by integrating these insights into a broader discussion at the exhibition, we can foster a dialogue between urban planners, historians, sociologists, and the public. This interaction can lead to a more informed and holistic approach to city planning and management, emphasizing sustainability, heritage preservation, and community engagement. V. The potential for ongoing collaboration post-exhibition is immense. Establishing permanent links between museums, libraries, and academic institutions could lead to the creation of an international network dedicated to urban studies. This network could facilitate the exchange of ideas, strategies, and exhibitions that continuously reflect the evolving nature of our cities. VI. By taking such steps, we not only enrich our understanding of urban environments but also equip ourselves to better anticipate and respond to future challenges. The	1908	2007.1796
The fan used was of the Sirocco centrifugal type. 2. Great difficulty was found in freeing the air stream in this channel from pulsations, and in order to attain the high degree of accuracy it was hoped to secure in model tests, combined with rapidity of working, a careful examination was undertaken into the conditions affecting the uniformity of flow. This led to an extensive series of tests on model channels of different forms and working under different conditions. Some particulars with regard to this research are here given, though it is impossible to follow through in detail all the points investigated. Ultimately a new 4 ft. channel was constructed to a design based on the results of these experiments, and is now in satisfactory working order.	3. The new channel was designed to minimize the turbulence and eddies that were observed in earlier prototypes. Special attention was given to the shape of the inlet and the smoothness of the channel walls, which were crafted from highly polished materials to reduce surface friction. Additionally, the curvature of the channel was carefully calculated to ensure a more laminar flow, avoiding sharp bends that could induce vortices. 4. An array of sensors was installed along the length of the channel to monitor the airflow characteristics continuously. These included velocity probes, pressure transducers, and turbulence meters, which provided real-time data that could be used to adjust the fan speed and channel configuration dynamically. 5. The results of the preliminary tests conducted in this new setup were promising. The airflow was found to be significantly more stable and uniform compared to the previous arrangements. This improvement was reflected in the accuracy and repeatability of the model tests, which showed a marked enhancement. 6. With the successful implementation of the new channel, further research is planned to explore its applications in various aerodynamic studies. The facility is expected to contribute	1912	1991.9152
Icing in advec tion Stratus can be serious because the cloud often contains large amounts of water, and may also contain vertical currents which are not noticeable as such, but are sufficient to enlarge the water droplets to a critical size for ice accretion. All clouds whose temperature is above freezing, of course, can be dismissed as icing hazards. FORECASTING. — Forecasting the occurrence of advection Stratus or Stratocumulus is not difficult. Clouds already present travel with the wind at their level. Their boundaries can be outlined on a map and their movements computed from the known wind direction and velocity. Clouds not yet present but which are likely to develop are more difficult to forecast.	The formation of such clouds often depends on specific atmospheric conditions, such as the presence of moisture at certain altitudes and the movement of air masses. Forecasters look for signs of these conditions using satellite imagery, radar data, and ground observations. When these factors align, it can indicate the potential development of advection Stratus or Stratocumulus clouds. Meteorologists also utilize numerical weather prediction models which simulate the atmosphere and its processes. These models help in understanding how the wind, temperature, and humidity will interact over time, which aids in predicting the formation and movement of cloud systems. By inputting current weather data and analyzing the output, forecasters can make educated predictions about where and when cloud cover will occur. Additionally, understanding the topography of the area is crucial as mountains, valleys, and bodies of water can significantly influence local weather patterns and cloud formation. Forecasters must consider these geographical factors when predicting cloud movements and developments. Overall, while the movement of existing clouds can be tracked with relative ease, predicting the formation of new advection Stratus or Stratocumulus clouds remains a more	1913	2005.5829
The work should be advertised again, and other bidders be allowed to revise their bids.‘ These are special cases, and are so fortified with conditions that a general statement of the law can scarcely be made. Indeed, it can hardly be desired that such general law should exist, for it might be employed as a means of avoiding the statute by getting a mock contractor to undertake the work and then abandon it to the merciless grasp of conspirators and boodlers. When proposals have been solicited for public work and they have been received, giving separate bids for the material and different kinds of work required in the construction, one of which has been accepted with the understanding that when the structure is located the amount to be paid will be determined by its length and size upon the basis ﬁxed in the bid, it is not necessary to advertise for new proposals when the structure is located, even though it is considerably shorter than was the one bid upon And when the advertisement and proposal was for paving a specified distance and the contract entered into was to pave only a part of that distance, “or further if ordered, ” it was held that it was not necessary to readvertise for proposals when the balance of the work was ordered to be done; that it was covered by the original contract If the council resolve to readvertise for bids for a street improvement because the lowest bid is in excess of the estimate by the engineer, their act must be approved by the mayor, or passed over his veto, as provided in the city charter.‘ If no notice to the ‘Dickinson 0. Poughkeepsie. 14 N. Y. 1‘ Twiss '0.	City of Buffalo, 82 N.Y. 233; the court pointed out that the requirement to readvertise must be strictly adhered to under specific circumstances outlined in the statute or charter. However, when the original contract or bid encompasses provisions for adjustments based on changes in project scope or scale, such adjustments are permissible without necessitating a new bidding process. This principle serves to prevent the unnecessary delays and expenses associated with re-solicitation of bids, while still maintaining transparency and fairness in the public contracting process. It is essential, however, that the original contract includes clear terms regarding how adjustments will be handled to ensure that all potential bidders are aware of these conditions from the outset. Moreover, if the scope of work changes significantly beyond what could reasonably have been anticipated at the outset, then re-advertisement might indeed be necessary to ensure competitive pricing and fairness. The determining factor is often the extent to which the original terms anticipated and made provision for the change in scope. Thus, while flexibility is allowed within the framework of an existing contract, there must be a balance to ensure that the process remains open	1913	1993.3037
"I think it desirable that this confusion should stop. And that must be my excuse for publishing this review. G. LOWES DICKINSON. 178 THE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW II. THE CHILD CRIMINAL. The Children's Bill, introduced by Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P.., the Undersecretary of State for the Home Department, opens a. new chapter in an important branch of the history of English jurisprudence. ""The law, "" as Mr. Herbert Samuel has said, ""relating to the punishment and restraint of child offenders is spread over a number of statutes and is in a state of some confusion."	"It is imperative that we bring order to this area of our legal framework to ensure that our youngest citizens, who may find themselves on the wrong side of the law, are treated not merely with justice, but with the compassion and consideration due their age and circumstances."" The bill proposes several significant changes aimed at reforming the way child offenders are handled within the legal system. One of the key features is the establishment of special courts designed specifically for cases involving children. These courts would not only have judges trained in juvenile psychology and developmental needs but would also provide a less intimidating environment, thus reducing the trauma experienced by young offenders. Furthermore, the bill suggests a shift from punitive measures to rehabilitative ones. Instead of incarceration, which can irreparably harm a child's development and prospects, the bill advocates for increased use of community service, counseling, and educational programs tailored to help reintegrate these young individuals into society. Additionally, the bill calls for a clearer definition of 'child' in legal terms, proposing that anyone under the age of eighteen should be considered a child in the eyes of the law, aligning"	1908	1998.728
"Of a sudden we were evidently perceived, and next second shots whistled about us, and poor Maitland, a private, fell forward upon his face in the road — dead. We heard loud shouting in German, which we could not understand, and in a moment the place seemed alive with the foreigners, while we only just had time to mount and tear away in the direction we had come. At Haw Wood I decided to pass the river by a by road I knew at Wissett, avoiding Halesworth on the right. As far as Chediston Green all was quiet, but on turning northward to Wissett at the crossroads outside the inn we perceived three men lurking in the shadow beneath the wall. "" With one of my men I abandoned my machine, and crept softly in their direction, not knowing whether they were farm labourers or the enemy's outposts. Slowly, and with great caution, we moved forward until, on listening intently, I heard them in conversation."	The voices were low and cautious, but unmistakably German. The men were discussing their next move, unaware of our proximity. My heart raced as I signaled to my companion to remain silent and motionless. We were outnumbered, and any rash action could jeopardize not only our mission but our very lives. Gathering every ounce of courage, I decided to continue eavesdropping, hoping to gather valuable information. The men spoke of a rendezvous point near the old mill on the outskirts of Wissett, where more of their comrades were supposed to meet them shortly. This was crucial intelligence — it indicated a larger enemy presence in the area than we had anticipated. Realizing the gravity of the situation, I silently retreated with my companion back to where we had left our machines. Once there, I quickly convened with the rest of my squad, informing them of the enemy's plans. It was decided that we would send a runner back to our headquarters with the information we had gathered, while the rest of us would try to observe the enemy movements from a safe distance. As we set out	1906	1970.3593
The four last cruisers in the German line suddenly altered course and steered straight at the British line,  while behind them, as before, followed six torpedo boats. Through the intervals at the head of the German line came the other six boats — an evolution which they had constantly rehearsed in peace, and which they carried out with admirable precision and dash in the crisis of battle — and charged the head of the British line. The rest of the German squadron maintained its original course, and covered the attack with a terrific fire, all its guns accelerating the rapidity of their discharge till the air hummed with projectiles. The attack was suddenly and vigorously delivered.	The British, however, were not unprepared. The maneuver had been anticipated, and the response was immediate and effective. The British cruisers, with their superior speed, managed to adjust their formation just in time to present a formidable broadside to the oncoming German ships. The roar of the British guns joined the cacophony of battle, creating a deafening thunder of artillery that echoed across the waters. As the German torpedo boats surged forward, the British destroyers, which had been held in reserve, swung into action. They darted towards the smaller, more vulnerable boats with lethal intent, launching their own torpedoes with deadly accuracy. A series of powerful explosions lit up the water as several of the German boats were struck, sending up towering plumes of water and debris. Above the melee, the British battlecruisers continued to exchange heavy fire with the German squadron. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and the shriek of shells slicing through the sky. Despite the ferocity of the German assault, the disciplined volley of the British fleet took its toll on	1906	1959.8231
The excellent report of Etalsraad Schou shows that this advance is due to the united buying power of the farmers, the enforced crop rotation in the fields, and the education provided by the schools of agriculture and the experiment stations subsidised by the government. The most remarkable of Denmark's successes, co operative marketing, is the handling of the distribution of the cooperative production. co operative societies have charge of a large proportion of the exports, a standard of exported goods has been set, trade marks authorised by the legislature have been made obligatory, and the government inspectors at the ports guarantee the quality of the goods they ship. The co operative export societies have their trade marks registered in Great Britain and other countries to which they export, and commercial agents to prosecute the infringers and to promote the trade. The co operative bacon factories also have registered trade marks and commercial agents.	These measures have significantly bolstered the reputation of Danish agricultural products abroad, leading to increased trust and demand. The co-operative dairy associations, too, have followed a similar path. They ensure that the butter and cheese exported under their labels meet stringent quality standards, often exceeding those demanded in international markets. This has allowed Danish dairy products to command premium prices on the global stage. Furthermore, the integration of advanced technology in farming practices, guided by the insights from agricultural schools and experiment stations, has increased yield and quality. The use of scientifically developed fertilizers and seeds adapted to the local climate conditions has enhanced crop resilience and productivity. The Danish government’s role in facilitating these advancements cannot be understated. By providing financial support and legislative backing, it has created an environment where agricultural co-operatives can thrive. This includes subsidies for technology adoption and legal frameworks that protect the intellectual property of co-operative societies.  This holistic approach—combining education, technology, co-operative structures, and government support—forms the backbone of Denmark’s agricultural success. It serves as a model for other countries aiming to enhance their agricultural sectors	1913	2005.2747
"But these judicious and stimulating, if slightly vague, appeals for the conversion of natural history into a science of causal relations and generalised laws, were not the principal purpose of the preliminary discourse. The thought of BufEon at the time when he wrote that essay seems to have been dominated above all by a single idea, which was also, one of the two or three ruling ideas of the whole of the first half of the eighteenth century — namely, the Leibnitian ""principle of continuity""' (lex continui). In the intellectual fashions of this period, next to the blessed word ""Nature"" the most sacred phrase was ""the Great Chain of Beings ""; indeed, one of the truths that man was supposed to know most surely about nature was that she ""makes no leaps."" In the form, . especially, of the neo platonic and Spinozistic metaphysical assumption that all possible forms must exist, the principle was much older than the philosophy of Leibniz; 7 but it owed to him and his disciples a more definite formulation and a greatly increased popular currency. It declared that all entities are arranged in a graded scale of similarity, so that for every being that exists there also exists some other (in the strict version of the principle, one and only one other) from which its difference is infinitesimal, i. e., less than any assignable difference."	This concept, deeply rooted in the philosophical and scientific discourse of the era, sought to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the natural world. By suggesting a continuum in the creation, where every species was linked to the next by minute gradations, the Great Chain of Beings offered a compelling narrative for the diversity of life. It was an attempt to impose order and reason on the complexity of nature, aligning with the Enlightenment's broader quest for knowledge through the application of reason and observation. The principle of continuity also had profound implications for the emerging field of biology. It challenged naturalists to find these missing links in the chain, to document and classify the natural world in a systematic way. This quest for understanding led to expeditions into unknown territories, collections of flora and fauna, and the meticulous work of cataloging and describing new species. The work of naturalists like Linnaeus, who sought to classify nature through a systematic taxonomy, was influenced by this conceptual framework. Moreover, the principle resonated with theological and moral considerations of the time. The seamless hierarchy of beings from the simplest to the most	1911	2005.0809
Hence in time the language of the colony as contrasted with that of the mother-country tends to seem, if not to be, archaic to the dwellers in the latter. Such a result has been distinctly manifest in the language of this country. Many of our so-called Americanisms represent the English usage of the former half of the seventeenth century, when the original settlements were made here. Most of this class of transported words were heard then everywhere in cultivated speech. On the other hand, some had their native home in the English dialects. They have never been used in English literature, at least on any scale worth considering. But brought over to America, they became here part of the common tongue. Take one notable illustration.	"The word ""fall"" used to describe the autumn season is a perfect example. In England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, ""fall"" was as commonly used as ""autumn."" However, as the language evolved in Britain, ""autumn"" became the preferred term, influenced perhaps by its use in literary and formal contexts. ""Fall,"" meanwhile, transported to the New World with the early settlers, retained its place in everyday American speech.  Another example is the word ""gotten,"" which is the past participle of ""to get."" In modern British English, ""got"" serves as both the past tense and past participle, but in American English, ""gotten"" remains in common use, preserving another linguistic relic of the era of colonization. These examples underscore how American English has served as a linguistic time capsule, preserving older forms that have since evolved or fallen out of usage in British English. This phenomenon is not merely a matter of vocabulary but extends to pronunciation and certain grammatical constructions, further distinguishing the two versions of the language and underscoring the unique linguistic evolution"	1913	2005.4517
"The young fellows called him "" Count Vollmer, "" and he accepted the title smilingly, without comment or remark. This phase of Huntford's acquaintance with Herr Vollmer continued for two or three weeks. Then came a very memorable evening, when the old German was suddenly presented to his consideration in an altogether different light. It was after a dinner at Muldoon's —  Lb au.it by Howard PyU HERR VOLLMER QUIETLY STEPPED OLT INTp THE STkl|ET   123 the last dinner that Herr Vollmer ever ate in the cellar restaurant. Huntford und he had finished, and were upon their way back to Herr Vollmer's room. Hunt ford was speaking about some German illustrations, and he was so busy talking and so interested in what he was saying that he did not notice that Herr Vollmer was unusually silent and unresponsive. As they drew near to Thirteenth Street, Herr Vollmer suddenly slipped his arm within Huntford's. "" My friend, "" he said, cutting in upon Huntford's talk, ""do not turn at Thirteenth Street; we are being followed."" Huntford was struck silent in an instant. "" Followed !"""	"he echoed, his voice a mixture of incredulity and concern. ""By whom, and why?"" Herr Vollmer's gaze was stern as he glanced over his shoulder discreetly. ""I cannot say precisely who they are, but I suspect they are people from my past. It's a long story, one for another time. For now, we must be cautious."" With a firm grip on Huntford's arm, Vollmer quickened their pace, steering them away from the usual path and down a less populated side street. The shadows of the evening seemed to deepen around them, casting an eerie pall over their hurried escape. Huntford, still processing the sudden shift in their quiet evening, kept his questions to himself, trusting Vollmer's judgment. His mind raced with possibilities — spies, old enemies, or perhaps debts from a hidden past? Vollmer was an enigma, wrapped in the genteel facade of an affable old man. As they turned another corner, Vollmer leaned closer and whispered, ""We will go to my friend's place. It's not far"	1913	1987.0308
At some distance from the shoreline it contains parcels with random vertical motions, which mix the moisture until it is more or less uniformly distributed in the whole layer. Because of the vertical random motions of its constituent parcels, the temperature lapse rate is rearranged to decrease at 5.5F per 1000 feet instead of increasing and then decreasing slightly. Because of the dryness of the air over water, vertical mixing over land cannot result in a cloud or fog. In the lower sketch is illustrated a condition conducive to both fog and low clouds under the sea breeze inversion. Both temperature and dewpoint are equal to each other and increase with altitude up to 800 or 1000 feet, above which they are relatively constant for a short distance. Air of these characteristics moving over land is first disturbed slightly by passage over irregular terrain and then by more vigorous random vertical motions of its parcels as it is heated at ground levels.	This heating at the surface causes the air to expand and rise, forming convective currents. As this warmer, moister air ascends, it cools adiabatically, and if the cooling is sufficient, the dew point is reached, leading to condensation and the formation of cloud droplets. This process is particularly enhanced during the day when solar heating intensifies the ground-level temperatures, increasing the rate of convection.  Moreover, if there is sufficient moisture and a continuous supply of warm air from the sea, this can lead to persistent cloud cover or fog, especially in coastal areas where the land-sea temperature differential is significant. This is often observed in regions with prevailing onshore winds, where the marine layer is pushed inland, and the topography can further influence the extent and thickness of the fog or cloud layer.  Additionally, the presence of pollutants or aerosols in the air over land can serve as additional condensation nuclei, potentially leading to denser and more extensive cloud or fog formations. This interaction between the marine air and the terrestrial conditions creates a dynamic and variable environment where	1913	1967.3268
2, and three coats of Emaillite No. 3, weighed 161.5 grs. per square metre). The values obtained for the tensile strength are given below, Table 11. Fig. 18 contains the stress strain diagrams of the unproofed linen No. 89 with those for the unexposed fabrics No. 96, doped with Cellon, and No. 90, doped with Emaillite. Fig. 19 contains the curves for No. 89 and the (a) and (6) curves for No. 96. The (c) carve is not reproduced, being extremely similar to (6), eg., the extension at 250 kgs. per metre load is 11'5 percent. Table 11. Fabric No. 96. Tensile Strength.	| Load (kgs) | Extension (%) | |-----------|----------------| | 100    | 5.0      | | 150    | 7.5      | | 200    | 10.0      | | 250    | 11.5      | | 300    | 13.0      | The results clearly illustrate the effect of the doping on the tensile properties of the fabric. It is evident that the application of Emaillite has a significant influence on enhancing the tensile strength and the elasticity of the fabric, which is crucial for its performance under stress. The increased extension percentage at higher loads demonstrates the fabric's improved ability to stretch without breaking, a desirable property in many practical applications where materials are subjected to variable loads. Furthermore, the stress-strain diagrams indicate a more pronounced elastic region and a higher yield point for the doped fabrics compared to the undoped linen No. 89. This suggests that the doping process not only increases the strength but also contributes to the durability and resilience of the material. This can be particularly beneficial	1912	1940.3236
are selected and wound about the post, each in opposite directions and tied in place. In pruning in after years these canes are preserved and the canes that grow from them are shortened back to two or three buds. The advantage of this method consists in the fact that it permits cultivation of the vineyard both ways and in the cheapness of the support. Its disadvantages    are that probably the vines are too crowded and the foliage and fruit do not have the best chance to develop. This crowding also encourages disease. High renewal method of training is a form of the upright system that is extensively and successfully employed on a large scale.	In this method, each year the vine is pruned back to a high trunk from which one or two new canes are selected to be the fruiting canes for the coming season. These canes are then trained vertically up a trellis system. The older wood is removed, which helps to manage diseases and pests by removing potential habitats and sources of infection. This method allows for a good circulation of air and sunlight, which is essential for the healthy growth of the grapes and minimizes the risk of fungal diseases. The high renewal method is particularly favored in regions where grape varieties benefit from vertical shoot positioning, which enhances exposure to sunlight and promotes a more uniform ripening process. The structure of the trellis system used can vary, but typically involves wires strung between posts, providing support that allows the canes to grow upward and the fruit to hang downward, facilitating easier harvesting. This training system, while more labor-intensive in terms of pruning and training the vines, often results in higher quality fruit, as the grapes receive optimal exposure to the elements they need most. Furthermore, by continually	1914	2003.016
"The pilgrims would say: "" Go away; it is a sin. We may not drink it."" The Turk would go away and come back again next minute. Then perhaps, after long haggling, the pilgrim would buy the liquor and put it hastily at the bottom of his sack, there to lie till the end of the fast and his homeward journey from Jerusalem. The voyage was full, of incident and interest. At every port some of the pilgrims descended to the ferry boats, and they had extraordinary disputes with Turkish boatmen who tried to charge extortionate sums for rowing to the main lanfl."	The language barrier only exacerbated these confrontations, with much gesticulating and raised voices, often attracting the attention of passersby who would stop to watch the spectacle. On board the ship, life was no less colorful. The pilgrims, coming from diverse backgrounds, shared stories of their homelands, sang traditional songs, and sometimes engaged in heated theological debates that could last well into the night. As the ship sailed through the Mediterranean, the pilgrims were treated to the sight of distant coastlines dotted with ancient ruins and small fishing villages, where life seemed unchanged by the passage of centuries. Occasionally, the ship would pass another vessel, and the pilgrims would wave at the strangers, feeling a kinship with other travelers, even though their destinations might be worlds apart. The food on the ship was a curious mix of local delicacies and attempts at familiar dishes, which sometimes went amusingly awry. Pilgrims would gather around the long tables, sharing meals and the inevitable critiques of the ship's version of their native cuisine. Despite the complaints, there was a communal sense of camar	1913	1997.152
The chief of these difficulties is in the method of conducting the current to the interior of the burner and obtaining a seal wliich will efficiently maintain the interior vacuum. In the case of glass (Cooper hewitt lamps, incandescent lamps, and Rontgen bulbs) it is sufficient if a platinum wire is sealed into the glass. The coper metre, which closely approximates that of quartz. Unfortunately, invar is forged metal, which loses its properties when brought to red heat; it is, therefore, impossible to make the seal in the same manner as with platinum. The method adopted is to grind in a tapered rod of invar into a conical quartz tube, and in this way form a mechanical seal.	This mechanical seal, while not as perfect as a glass-to-metal seal, does provide a reasonably effective barrier against the intrusion of air, maintaining the necessary vacuum inside the burner. However, this approach does present some challenges. The differential thermal expansion between the invar rod and the quartz tube can lead to stress and potential failure of the seal during temperature fluctuations, which are common in the operation of such lamps. To mitigate these issues, engineers often incorporate flexible sealing materials or additional mechanical components that can accommodate these thermal stresses. For instance, a thin layer of mica or ceramic might be used as an intermediary material that can withstand high temperatures and also provide some flexibility. Additionally, spring-loaded or adjustable sealing mechanisms may be employed to maintain pressure on the seal, ensuring its integrity throughout the operational life of the lamp. Despite these complexities, the use of invar and quartz remains a popular choice due to their durability and resistance to thermal and chemical degradation. Continuous advancements in material science and engineering are further improving the reliability and efficiency of these seals, thereby enhancing the overall performance of vacuum-based lighting systems and devices.	1912	2002.8033
It may often be a help to an apple orchard to have the tree trunks shaded by small fruits, such as raspberries and currants. Planting with fillers is the name given to the system of planting whereby an extra number of trees are set out with the purpose of cutting them out as soon as they get large enough to crowd the trees that are to grow to maturity. Good examples of this practice are found in the planting of peaches or plums in the intervals between apples, or in planting twice as many peaches or plum trees on the land as can grow to maturity, the intention in each case being to cut out one half of them as soon as the trees begin to crowd. This is not a bad practice when well carried out but in the hands of the average fruit grower the thinning process is seldom begun soon enough. This may result in serious injury and is always harmful.	The trees which are allowed to become overcrowded struggle for light, nutrients, and water, stunting their growth and reducing their overall health and fruit production. The practice of thinning, though theoretically beneficial, requires careful timing and execution. It is crucial for the fruit grower to monitor the growth rate and health of the trees closely, ensuring that the fillers are removed before they begin to impose stress on the permanent trees. Moreover, the selection of which trees to remove and which to keep should be based on their health, growth patterns, and the quality of fruit they produce, rather than simply removing every other tree or choosing at random. This strategic approach can maximize the orchard's productivity and extend the lifespan of the fruit trees. Additionally, proper pruning techniques should accompany the thinning process. Pruning not only helps in controlling the size and shape of the trees but also improves sunlight penetration and air circulation, which are vital for reducing the incidence of diseases and pests.  In essence, while the concept of planting with fillers can optimize the use of space and potentially increase early yields, it demands	1914	2004.6295
These references refer mainly to articles in the Journal /. Gasbeleuch tung. Practical Exercises in Physiological Optics. By Prof. G. J. Burch, M.D.., D.Sc., F.R.S.. (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 4s. net.) THIS little book was written for the practical classes in Physiological Optics at Oxford University, and contains a number of suggestive experiments, some of which will doubtless be new to many of those interested in this subject. There are six sections containing upwards of sixty problems. Section I., on dioptrics, contains more or less familiar work on lens formulse and their application to the eye, and Section II. is devoted to more advanced exercises on the same subject. Section III. deals with judgement of space and distance, and Section IV.	focuses on the perception of motion and depth. The exercises here are designed to illustrate how the human visual system interprets movement and spatial relationships, providing a deeper understanding of phenomena such as parallax, stereopsis, and motion parallax. Section V explores color vision, offering experiments that reveal the complexities of how we perceive and differentiate colors. This section also delves into the effects of various lighting conditions on color perception and discusses common color vision deficiencies. The final section, Section VI, addresses the physiological responses of the eye, including experiments on afterimages, adaptation to darkness, and the impact of light intensity on pupil size. Each experiment is carefully structured to not only teach the underlying theory but also to engage students in hands-on learning that reinforces their understanding of key concepts in physiological optics. Professor Burch's manual is particularly valuable for its clear explanations and its emphasis on experimental verification of theoretical principles. It serves not only as a textbook for students but also as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of vision science. By providing detailed instructions and the scientific context for each experiment, this book encourages	1912	2007.2568
"All this is coupled with most entertaining narratives of extra normal psychological phenomena, for the sake of explaining them on the basis of the physical knowledge presented. But the climax of the effort is attained only at the close of the work, where all the information presented is applied to the problem of immortality. The reader will become somewhat acquainted with the author's method and conclusions by the following quotation, near the end of the big book. ""We learn that even before the body is dissolved in death there already evolves within it a subtle substance which seems to act as the especial instrumentality of this exalted consciousness [the consciousness of pure reason or abstract intelligence]."	This substance, imperceptible to the ordinary senses and discernible only to those who have developed a higher form of perception, may be thought of as the vehicle through which the soul operates more directly and with less constraint than through the gross physical mechanism. It is this ethereal medium that, according to the theory proposed, carries the essence of a person's being beyond the dissolution of the body, thus providing a basis for the belief in immortality. Upon death, this finer substance does not perish with the corporeal elements but persists, maintaining the continuity of consciousness. The persistence of this subtler body supports the notion that the self can exist independently of the physical form, and in a state that transcends the limitations of temporal existence. This concept aligns with those found in various spiritual traditions around the world, wherein it is posited that the soul survives physical death, entering into a new phase of existence in a different realm or returning to the source from which it originated. Therefore, by integrating the empirical observations of modern science with the metaphysical speculations of ancient wisdom, the author attempts to construct	1911	1959.421
"Magic, as a system of natural law, is based on two principles of thought, which in their day were legitimate hypotheses: ""first, that like produces like; and, second, that things which have once been in contact continue to act on each other even after the contact has been severed"" (p. 37). From this it seems to follow — though I am not sure whether Dr. Frazer would admit the consequence — that magic would not arise until the idea began to dawn on men that these two principles of thought were not legitimate hypotheses. So long as they were believed legitimate and regarded as a system of natural law, there was no magic in them : they were simply a statement of the rules which determine the sequence of events throughout the world. It was when suspicion — well founded suspicion, as eventually appeared — began to fall upon them, that they began to be illegitimate, and — as illegitimate — magical. On this view, Dr. Frazer's theory shows us the origin of magic by taking us back to a period when the belief in magic did not exist, and points out how, and out of what, it grew up."	The implication here is profound in that it suggests a transition in human cognition and the framing of our understanding of the world. As these principles began to be questioned, their application shifted from being seen as natural and inherent to the understanding of the cosmos, to something more arcane and mystical. This shift reflects not just a change in the intellectual landscape but also in the sociocultural context in which these ideas were embedded.  As these once accepted natural laws started to be viewed with skepticism, the practices based on them—once common and integrated into the daily life and survival strategies of a community—began to be relegated to the realm of the occult. This transformation also underscores the dynamic nature of knowledge and belief systems, illustrating how cultural practices can evolve from mainstream to marginal, from scientifically endorsed to the esoteric. This evolution of thought and practice also opens up a broader discussion about the nature of belief and legitimacy. What is considered rational or irrational, scientifically valid or invalid, is deeply influenced by the prevailing paradigms and power structures of the time. Thus, magic, in Frazer's analysis, emerges	1908	2007.4381
The top of the float is slightly domed to throw off the water. On account of the forward position of the fin surface of the floats, and the powerful propeller, it was desirable for directional stability to fit a large tail fin. A triangular fin was arranged with its vertical side against the rudder post. Trial showed that the aeroplane was well under control at all angles of yaw. 71. Delay having been experienced in getting the 100 HP. engine ordered, it was decided to make her trials with a 70 HP. engine, and the following results were thought good in view of the small engine used. As a land machine with skids and with the small engine, the speed was over 69 mph. with pilot, passenger and 45 gallons of petrol, viz., sufficient for six hours' flight with this engine. 72. Water tests were made at Frensham Great Pond by kind permission of Mr. Comb. No difficulty appeared in steering on the smooth water nor in getting off or alighting. Experiments will later be made on wares, after the necessary preliminary tests of steering on water in stronger winds. 73. The leading dimensions of H.R.E. 2 are as follows : - Span Chord Wing area Gap Stagger Area of tail plane Area of elevator...	Area of rudder, and overall length. The biplane structure of H.R.E. 2, designed for optimum aerodynamic efficiency, features a span of 36 feet, a chord of 6 feet, and a total wing area of 216 square feet. The gap between the upper and lower wings is 6 feet, with a slight forward stagger of 2 feet to enhance stability and control. The tail plane covers an area of 32 square feet, providing substantial support and balance during flight. The elevator, crucial for controlling the pitch, spans 20 square feet, while the rudder, responsible for directional control, measures 15 square feet. The overall length of the aircraft is 27 feet, allowing for a streamlined and efficient design conducive to both high speed and maneuverability. These dimensions contribute to the aircraft's ability to perform well under various conditions, making it a versatile choice for both experimental and practical aviation purposes. Further adjustments and optimizations are planned as more flight data becomes available.	1912	1959.9445
It is interesting and remarkable that the haemolytic action of saponine (Ransom) and also of agaricine and tetanolysine (Noguchi) is arrested by cholesterol; the saponine combines with cholesterol, and the combination is unable to act on the corpuscle and bring about its haemolysis. It is apparently the alcoholic hydroxyl in cholesterol, not the unsaturated carbon atoms, that is here operative (Hausmann). It is not, however, by any means entirely on account of the light that it has been hoped might be thrown on the physical constitution of protoplasm that the phenomenon of haemolysis has been so assiduously worked at in recent years. When blood corpuscles, certain bacteria, animal cells or merely protein substances are injected into an animal, something is found to be formed in that  animal which reacts with similar corpuscles, bacteria, cells or proteins.	This reaction is specific, that is, the substance formed in the animal will react only with the particular type of corpuscle, bacterium, cell, or protein that was originally injected, not with others. Such substances are generally known as antibodies, and the process by which they are produced is termed immunization. The implications of this phenomenon are profound, particularly in the field of medicine and immunology.  By studying haemolysis and the related immune responses, researchers have been able to develop vaccines that protect against various diseases by stimulating the production of specific antibodies. Furthermore, this line of research has expanded our understanding of autoimmune diseases, where the body mistakenly targets its own cells as if they were foreign invaders.  The specific interaction between antibodies and antigens (the molecules that provoke an immune response) is also a cornerstone in diagnostic tests. These tests can detect the presence of particular bacteria or viruses in the body by observing whether a sample of blood or other body fluids reacts with known antibodies.  Moreover, the study of haemolysis has implications for understanding basic physiological processes, such as the mechanisms	1913	2001.4983
It must also be born in mind that the difference between the maximum efficiency in this case and for propeller Si is only the difference between 69-3 percent, and 66-8 percent. In order to examine the agreement between the calculated and experimental values more closely, more particularly with regard to the actual forces of thrust and torque, it was decided to integrate the forces on the propeller blades as accurately as possible, and compare them with the experimental values An account of this work and the results obtained follows. 206 Wind channel experiments on aerofoils having sections similar to those of the propeller. — In making the comparison between the results calculated from the aerofoil experiments and the experimental propeller results, care was taken to make the conditions as exact as possible. Six aerofoils were made from the same templates as had been used for the construction of the propeller. These were sections of the propeller at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 ins.	from the hub, each accurately scaled to represent the aerodynamic profile at those specific radii. The aerofoils were then tested in the wind tunnel under controlled conditions that matched as closely as possible the operational environment of the propeller. This included adjustments for air density, velocity, and angle of attack, ensuring that the data from the aerofoil tests would be relevant to the propeller's performance in actual flight conditions. The thrust and torque for each section were measured using sensitive load cells that could detect minute changes in force. These results were then aggregated to predict the overall performance of the full propeller. The integration process involved calculating the local lift and drag coefficients from the aerofoil data, and then applying these coefficients to the broader propeller model. The comparison between these integrated values and the actual measurements from the propeller tests revealed a high degree of correlation, validating the accuracy of the wind tunnel aerofoil experiments as a method for predicting propeller performance. Discrepancies were within acceptable margins of error and could primarily be attributed to slight variations in the manufacturing process and assembly of	1912	1998.8014
In the dim light she looked to be of about 2500 tonnes displacement as she steered straight for the Leicestershire. Captain Cornwall ordered one of the inshore torpedo boats to proceed to her, and examine her, and direct her, if she was not British, to go into Leith, thus taking upon his shoulders the considerable responsibility of interfering with a foreign ship in time of peace. But she paid no attention to the torpedo boat. She was about 3000 yards off the Leicestershire when the order to the boat was given, and she had now approached within 1500 yards. Disquieted by her proceedings, Captain Cornwall ordered one of the 3 pounders to fire a shot across her bow, and then, as this did not stop her, followed it up with two shots from a 3 pounder directed against her hull. At the first shot across her bows she swung round, now little more than a thousand yards away from the British cruiser, bringing her broadside to bear.	"As she turned, the silhouette of her structure became more defined against the fading light, revealing a formidable array of guns bristling along her side. Tension aboard the Leicestershire rose palpably; men stood at their stations, eyes fixed on the potentially hostile vessel, hands ready at weapon controls. Captain Cornwall, observing through his binoculars, noted the foreign ship’s aggressive posture and the readiness of her crew. It was clear this was no mere merchant vessel, but a warship of considerable firepower. ""Signal the flagship, and all ships in the squadron,"" Captain Cornwall ordered his signal officer. ""Enemy vessel engaging. Prepare for combat."" The signal flags fluttered up, communicating the urgent message. Meanwhile, the foreign ship had completed her maneuver and now faced the Leicestershire directly. A tense moment passed, the sea between them rippling ominously under the twilight. Then, without warning, the foreign warship unleashed a volley, her guns roaring as they spewed fire and iron towards the British cruiser. The air was filled with the deafening blasts of cannon fire"	1906	1956.6672
He did all that he could by insisting on actually producing, by such means as seemed most natural, as much as he consumed. Nor was it possible for him, any more than for the rest of us, to make a right disposition of his land or of the revenues from it. To give it to the State under present conditions would be merely to add to the wealth and power of an institution of which he did not approve, and to induce new State extravagance or to lighten the burden of those who support it. To present it to the tenants would be merely to create numerous small landlords who would be more effective in sanctioning landlordism than one big landlord. This is what the English Tories have striven to do for Ireland by Government Land Purchase and in the Allotment Acts. Under present conditions every one must be either a nomad, a tenant or a landowner.	Thus, he found himself in a dilemma from which there seemed no escape. The ideal solution would involve a radical restructuring of societal norms and economic systems—a utopian vision far from practical implementation. He pondered the notions of communal ownership or cooperative land management, systems that might allow for equitable use and enjoyment of the land without the perpetuation of entrenched class distinctions and the inequities of landlordism. Yet, how to implement such a system without the backing of the state or the consensus of the populace remained a vexing question. His thoughts also turned to the potential of using the land for educational purposes or as a model of sustainable agriculture, which could serve as a practical demonstration of alternative economic systems. By fostering a community where the land was held in common trust and used for the collective benefit, perhaps he could plant the seeds for broader societal changes. However, the challenges of such endeavors were manifold, involving not only logistical and financial considerations but also the need to shift public perception and societal values. In the end, the complexity of the issue weighed heavily on him. The responsibility of owning land, with	1911	2001.9335
But there was a kind cripple near the door, holding a little girl by the hand, who was of a different mind, and who bade them believe that they certainly would be let in; and they followed him round to a side entrance, where presently quiet folk, young and old, with prayer books in their hands, began softly to arrive, and to exhale a Sabbath scent from the clothes put by on all weekdays. It appeared that the kind cripple was right; they who had come to revere were allowed as hospitably in as those who had come to pray, and our pilgrims were in no wise hindered from finding the shrine of their devotion opposite the chantry which William of Wykeham designed for himself. They were also free to look at the other monuments while a sweetly solemn chanting and intoning went on in a far corner of the fane; but they did not see even the painted chests which hold the bones of such kings as Ethel wolf, Egbert, Canute, and William Rufus, pathetically unable to know themselves apart, after a lapse of so much time.	Instead, they were drawn irresistibly to the quiet beauty of the stained glass, which cast a kaleidoscope of colors upon the ancient stone floor. The light filtered through scenes of biblical lore and the lives of saints, painting the air with stories told in hues of ruby, sapphire, and emerald. The pilgrims moved slowly, their eyes uplifted, absorbing the silent sermons emanating from above. As they wandered, they came upon a small chapel, tucked away behind the main altar. Here, the air was cooler, the light dimmer, but no less filled with a sense of peace. In this secluded spot, the walls were adorned with frescoes faded by time but still vibrant with the tales they told. Each brushstroke spoke of devotion and artistry, of a time when these images served not only as decoration but also as a means of communication of the divine. The pilgrims felt a deep reverence in this space, surrounded by the echoes of centuries of prayer and contemplation. They noticed small votive candles flickering in niches, each flame a silent prayer or	1913	1967.5962
"It was thought to be possible for a change in roughness of surface to affect the resnlts, but from an experiment made (cf. Section vii) this does not appear to be probable. The extraneous disturbances which always render the measurement of small drift forces a matter requiring extreme care do not usually have any appreciable effect on the measurement of lift, and it is mainly for the evidence which can be obtained from a comparison of the lift coefficients that the large scale results here discussed are valuable. Before comparing the results it should be stated that an appreciable correction has been applied to the published figures. The basis of the correction will be . clear from the following quotation : — ""The mounting had been designed so that the surfaces were placed ."	"in a parallel alignment with the airflow, ensuring minimal interference from structural elements. However, upon closer inspection and subsequent wind tunnel testing, it was observed that there was a slight misalignment which could potentially influence the lift measurements. Consequently, the results were adjusted to account for this anomaly by recalculating the angle of attack to reflect the actual conditions during the experiments."" This correction is crucial as it directly affects the reliability and accuracy of the data being analyzed. With this adjustment, the lift coefficients derived from the experiments can be considered more representative of true aerodynamic behavior in controlled conditions. The corrected data allows for a more precise comparison with theoretical predictions and models, thereby enhancing the validity of the study’s conclusions. Furthermore, the large scale of the experiments provides a unique opportunity to observe aerodynamic phenomena that may not be apparent in smaller, more conventional studies. This scale not only tests the limits of existing theories but also contributes to the development of new insights into the complex interactions within fluid dynamics. As such, the findings from these adjusted results are expected to play a significant role in advancing aerodynamic research and applications."	1912	1996.9789
In Mrs. Ward's case it seems to spring from a persistent tenacity in keeping all the facts and circumstances and opinions of all the people in the story from escaping. That is the business of science or photography, but not of art, and Mrs. Ward seems not sufficiently to have made that distinction. It would be unfair to say that the later novels do not show some improvement in this respect. David Grieve, however, is a biography in which the interest centres about detached episodes in the life of the hero. Marcella and those that follow escape this weakness more nearly, but the sense of undue elaboration of irrelevant detail prevails in some degree in all of them. It doubtless satisfies an instinct for verisimilitude, but verisimilitude is only a first step in art.	The true artist must know not only how to include but also how to exclude. Therein lies the delicate balance that elevates mere accurate representation into the realm of the evocative and sublime. Mrs. Ward's meticulous attention to detail, while commendable for its thoroughness, occasionally burdens the narrative, slowing the pace and diluting the emotional resonance of the central themes. Art, in its most profound form, suggests rather than tells, evokes rather than explains. It leaves space for the audience to insert their own thoughts and emotions, to engage actively with the work, rather than passively receiving a fully formed, unyielding structure. In essence, Mrs. Ward's novels, replete with precise and exhaustive depictions, could benefit from a lighter touch—a more impressionistic style that sketches with bold strokes rather than meticulous dotting. This would not only quicken the rhythm of her narratives but also deepen the impact, allowing the core messages and emotional undertones more room to breathe and resonate with the reader. Such a shift might transform her detailed accounts into truly transcendent works, where the	1911	1986.7056
"""O, no. He does very well as he is. But woman is much more interesting. Her soul is the more fascinating study. I find, however, this strange difference between them: A woman will easily confide in me. Her soul opens like a flower at my touch, and I may see all that she herself can see — but remember that in woman there is always much that cannot be seen: heights and depths that only some great crisis may reveal. Well, when I have explored the secret recesses of her soul, and she realises that I know her, she feels resentful, and remains so ever afterward. But I can vivisect a man — I can, as it were, cut him open, and take out his red heart, and hold it in my hand and watch its pulsations and learn its inmost secrets — and yet he does not resent it."" ""Is it not true that woman likes to be dominated by man?"	"Perhaps, in some cases, that is so. But it is also true that she resents any intrusion into the inner sanctum of her being, which she regards as a sort of sacred grove not to be entered without her permission. Man, on the other hand, often views such explorations as a form of recognition or validation of his own worth and complexity."" ""Indeed,"" he continued, ""it is a curious thing, the human heart—both metaphorically and literally. Men seem to feel that understanding their depths adds to their stature, while women often perceive it as a reduction, a simplification of their mysteries. It is as if men take pride in being deciphered, while women see it as a diminishment."" ""Then, is it not a dangerous game, this delving into souls?"" she asked, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and fascination. ""Dangerous, perhaps, but also enlightening.

The more saturated acids the fat contains, the less liable is it to become rancid; cacao butter, for instance, is rarely found to undergo this change. The presence in a fat of other substances on which bacteria can grow increases the probability of rancidity; butter, for instance, is particularly prone to the change. But a sterile fat may nevertheless become rancid; and, as Duclaux showed, the growth of bacteria in an impure sat, though it may promote a tendency to rancidity, is not the cause of the change. C. OTHER ALCOHOLS AND THEIR FATTY ACID ESTERS. The term wax, which has from common use been applied to substances of very different chemical nature with certain obvious but ill defined physical properties, has been given a place in chemical terminology which introduces the necessity for restricting its application in some directions and extending it in others.	Waxes, in the strictest chemical sense, are esters derived from long-chain alcohols and fatty acids. Unlike fats, which are typically glycerol esters, waxes are formed from a variety of alcohols, each contributing distinct characteristics to the final product. For instance, the alcohol component in beeswax is predominantly triacontanol, while carnauba wax contains mainly ceryl alcohol. This variation in alcohol types is partly responsible for the diverse physical properties seen across different waxes. In extending the application of the term 'wax', it is crucial to differentiate between natural waxes, which are biologically sourced and contain a complex mixture of esters, and synthetic waxes, which are often simpler in composition and manufactured through industrial processes. Natural waxes are typically found as protective coatings on leaves and fruits, in animal fur, and as secretions from insects, such as the aforementioned beeswax. These waxes offer water repellency and protection from environmental factors. The chemical stability of waxes compared to fats can be attributed to their saturated nature and the	1913	2004.1866
Now we must turn to the means of inspiration. CHAPTEE XXIV  'We should always keep in mind the end of all school education. The pupil is not only to become able, but also to become willing, to fulfil the ideal aims of life. There is no need that the school make him willing to aim toward selfish ends. The desire for pleasure and the dislike of pain are always with him and are always working as motives in his daily life. But the ideal aims which, as such, do not appeal to mere feelings of pleasure and pain and which do not promise selfish gratification cannot become imj)ulses and motives for the child's effort, if an enthusiasm and a belief in them and a willingness to work for them are not impressed on the young soul.	The school, therefore, must instill a sense of duty and a recognition of the higher satisfactions that come from dedication to communal and altruistic goals. It must foster not only knowledge but also character, shaping students who are not only intellectually capable but also morally committed to enriching and uplifting society. To this end, the role of the teacher becomes crucial. It is the teacher who, by example and through instruction, awakens in the pupil the sense of what is noble and worthy of pursuit. The teacher must be more than a mere transmitter of facts; they must be a mentor, a guide, and a role model. They must demonstrate through their own actions the joy and fulfillment that can be derived from a life devoted to the greater good. Moreover, the curriculum itself must be designed to encourage these ideals. It should include not only the traditional subjects but also lessons in ethics, civic responsibility, and social justice. Literature, history, and even science can be taught in such a way that they illuminate the interconnectedness of human beings and the importance of striving for a common good. Additionally, the	1909	1973.9677
"From where we were we could see the coastguards held prisoners in their station, with German sentries mounted around; and as the tide was now setting strong to the westward, Ted and I first let our anchor off the ground and allowed ourselves to drift. It occurred to me that perhaps I might be able to give the alarm at some other coastguard station if I could only drift away unnoticed in the busy scene now in progress. "" That the Germans had actually landed in England was now apparent ; yet we wondered what our own fleet could be doing, and pictured to ourselves the jolly good drubbing that our cruisers would give the audacious foreigner when they did haul in sight."	As we drifted, the clamor and confusion on shore waxed ever greater. The German forces, emboldened by their initial success, were quick to establish a foothold, commandeering local resources and rounding up the townsfolk who watched in dismay and disbelief. Meanwhile, Ted and I kept low in our small boat, hearts pounding, as we were swept along by the current. The smoke of fires began to rise from the direction of the village, signaling that the situation was escalating rapidly. Our plan was desperate but clear: we needed to reach another coastguard station without attracting the attention of the enemy. To our advantage, the focus of the Germans seemed to be primarily on securing their position on land, and in the commotion, our humble craft went largely unnoticed. Every so often, we caught snippets of shouted commands and the distant rumble of what could only be artillery. It seemed impossible that such a scene could unfold on English soil, a land that had felt secure and inviolable for so long. Yet here we were, witness to an invasion, with the familiar coastline transformed into	1906	1978.9943
"Has he told you what's happened?"" The question was addressed to Miss Glenwilliam, while the speaker shot an indicating thumb in his brother's direction. The girl looked embarrassed, and Arthur Coryston again came to the rescue. "" We'Ve no right to thrust our family affairs upon other people, Corry, "" he said, resolutely. "" I told you so as we walked up."" "" Oh, but they're so interesting, "" was Coryston's cool reply, as he took his seat by Marion Atherstone. "" I'M certain everybody here finds them so. And what on earth have I taken Knatchett for, except to blazon abroad what our dear mother has been doing?"" "" I wish to heaven you hadn't taken Knatchett, "" said Arthur, sulkily.

Marion Atherstone, sensing the tension, tried to change the subject with a light laugh. ""Well, Corry, since you’ve made us all so curious, perhaps you should at least share a tale or two that won’t cause any family strife."" But Coryston was not to be diverted. He leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with the kind of reckless enjoyment that comes from stirring the pot. ""Oh, but Arthur, where’s the fun in that? Besides, it’s not as if anything we say here will remain within these walls. Knatchett might as well serve some purpose since I've gone to the trouble of opening its doors."" Arthur shot him a withering look. ""You're enjoying this far too much."" Ignoring his brother’s disapproval, Coryston turned to the gathered guests.

It is more usual for a private owner, and even companies, to invite by letter such contractors and builders as they desire to entertain proposals from, to make bids. The expense of printing blank forms of proposals, specifications, and contracts is then saved, the engineer or architect keeping on ﬁle at his office, and open for the inspection of the bidders, the specifications and plans and general contract form to be used, with his estimate of the quantities.	This method not only facilitates a more controlled and focused bidding process but also allows the owner or their representatives to select contractors known for their reliability and quality of work. By directly inviting certain contractors, it is possible to somewhat predict the level of professionalism and adherence to deadlines that will be involved in the project. This selective tendering approach helps maintain standards and can lead to a more efficient construction process overall. The contractors, once invited, typically visit the architect's or engineer's office to review the detailed plans and specifications. This review period is crucial as it allows the contractors to fully understand the scope of the work, assess potential challenges, and prepare a more accurate bid. They can also ask for clarifications or further details from the architect or engineer during this stage, which helps prevent misunderstandings or discrepancies later on. After reviewing the necessary documents, the contractors submit their bids by a specified deadline. These bids are then carefully evaluated based on criteria such as price, the contractor's experience and reputation, the feasibility of the timeline, and the overall quality of the proposed approach to the project. This evaluation is critical in	1913	2003.6664
to 2° — 15° at 50 ft./sec. These considerations from observations of pressure distribution suggest the possibility of further useful analysis if the previous methods be extended to an investigation of the variations of pressure when the speed changes. Drift coefficients. — The changes in the value of the drift coefficient at the upper critical angle are again very marked. Owing, however, to the Bmall value  79 ■of the drift at the lower critical angle the changes in the drift coefficient at that point are not easily traced on the curves. Although a limiting value of the drift is not definitely indicated, it will be noticed that the curves at 40 and 50 ft./sec. are not greatly different, agreeing with the lift coefficients in indicating approximation to a limiting type of flow as the value of oZ/v increases. LiftlDrift. — The variations in the drift coefficient are most clearly indicated by curves of lift/drift.	These curves demonstrate a decreasing trend in the drift coefficient as the speed increases, particularly beyond the lower critical angle. This decrease in drift, coupled with an increase in lift, results in a higher lift-to-drift ratio, which is crucial for efficient aerodynamic performance. The lift-to-drift ratio essentially measures the efficiency of the wing or airfoil in converting the airflow into useful lift rather than wasteful drag.  As the angle of attack increases up to the upper critical angle, the lift coefficient reaches its peak before starting to decrease due to stalling. The corresponding drift at these higher angles begins to rise sharply, reducing the lift-to-drift ratio and indicating less aerodynamic efficiency. This behavior underlines the importance of operating within certain aerodynamic limits to maintain optimal performance. Further studies could involve detailed computational fluid dynamics simulations to visualize the flow patterns around the airfoil and better understand the mechanisms behind these changes in lift and drift coefficients. Additionally, wind tunnel experiments with varying air speeds and angles of attack could provide empirical data to validate the theoretical models and simulations. Such comprehensive analysis would be invaluable in designing	1912	1992.837
"To characterise the negroes merely as a passive race, as is often done, does not fully cover the situation. It is more nearly correct to describe them as pliable and imitative. Ability to bend and adapt has proved the negro's salvation in the supreme test of contact with complex and often rigid white institutions. In marked contrast stands the American Indian whose "" grand refusal"" has been his undoing. Not only has the negro of the new world survived transplanting, but he has everywhere taken on the cultural tone of the particular white group with which he has been brought in contact. In Spanish America he has acquired the taste in dress and the pride bearing of the Castilian. In Haiti he is essentially French and in Brazil Portuguese."	In the United States, the African American population has absorbed and helped to shape a unique cultural identity, blending African traditions with the varying customs of Europeans and others. This fusion is evident in music, where genres like jazz, blues, and gospel—rooted in African musical principles but heavily influenced by the American experience—have emerged. This adaptability extends to language as well, with African American Vernacular English (AAVE) standing as a testament to a distinct linguistic blend that incorporates English with African linguistic patterns. Moreover, this capacity for cultural amalgamation has also manifested in religious practices. African Americans have not only adopted Christianity but have infused it with African religious elements, creating vibrant and expressive forms of worship that have significantly influenced the American religious landscape. The culinary traditions of African Americans further illustrate this synthesis, with soul food being a prime example of how traditional African cooking techniques and ingredients have been melded with Native American and European influences to create a cuisine that is entirely unique to the African American community. Thus, the resilience and adaptability of the African American community demonstrate a dynamic capacity to engage with and transform	1911	2006.6184

119). The deflection of the AXE free end is given by ' as before, the scales being suitably chosen. The method in such a case is a purely graphical one, consisting in drawing the bending moment diagram to scale, measuring A and finding x by any of the various graphical methods, or finding the product Axe by a derived area, as in Art. 68; the derived area corresponding to the pole B would represent the area under a curve M. x with origin at B. If the irregular loading consists of a number of concentrated loads, the whole area A may be looked upon as the sum of the areas of a number of triangles, and the product A . x as the sum of the products of the areas of the several triangles and the distances of their centroids from the free end. Propped Cantilever. Irregular Load.	For a propped cantilever subjected to an irregular load distribution, the analysis becomes slightly more complex due to the support reactions at both ends. The cantilever is fixed at one end and simply supported at the other, introducing a reaction that must be calculated in order to determine the bending moments throughout the beam. The first step involves calculating the reactions at the supports. This can be done by applying the conditions of static equilibrium—namely, the sum of vertical forces and the sum of moments about any point must equal zero. Once the reactions are known, the bending moment at any section of the beam can be computed by considering the effects of external loads and reactions from the supports. To draw the bending moment diagram for this scenario, start from the free end of the beam and work towards the fixed support, summing up the moments due to the distributed and concentrated loads, as well as the reaction at the simple support. The bending moment at the fixed end will always be zero because of the fixed support condition. The area under the bending moment diagram between any two points along the beam represents the change	1908	1987.1237
While the males and females of fish, reptiles and amphibians, follow the rule of the cochineal insect, exactly the reverse is true of birds and mammals, for among these the males are practically always the larger. In reality, however, maleness and femaleness are fundamentally unaltered throughout the living world, and the apparently contradictory evidence from the higher forms of life is traceable to their peculiar habits of reproduction. Most important of all in this connexion is brooding, for it throws light, from two angles at least, on the physical superiority of the male sex. Maternity, whether in birds or mammals, demands tremendous sacrifices — in fact is the very thing responsible for their higher development. Moreover, these sacrifices are not laid down in one lump sum, but bit by bit, and it may take years before all the premiums needed to insure a new life completely have been paid up.	This continual investment of energy and resources into the process of gestation and rearing of offspring necessarily diverts significant biological capital from the female, which could otherwise be used for her own growth and enhancement. Thus, while the male is free from these maternal duties, he is able to allocate more of his physiological resources towards growth, leading to a larger size and often more pronounced secondary sexual characteristics. Furthermore, in many species, the role of the male extends beyond mere fertilization to include various forms of territorial defense and competition for mates. These roles often demand greater physical strength and size, which are advantageous in confrontations with rivals and predators alike. This evolutionary pressure further skews the size disparity between males and females in birds and mammals. The phenomenon of sexual dimorphism, therefore, is not merely a product of reproductive roles but is deeply intertwined with the ecological and social demands placed upon each sex. The larger size of males in many bird and mammal species is a testament to the complex interplay of reproduction, survival strategies, and environmental adaptation.	1911	1993.5111

The town is indeed a triumph of concentration of purpose, of efficiency, of compactness. tile LITTLE TEPL FLOWS BENEATH GREEN. WOODED HEIGHTS  The Stream of Breakfasters has the Air of a picnic party Its very situation makes wasted space almost impossible. The little river Tepl flows down a smiling valley between green, wooded heights. As it nears its junction with the Eger the hills come closer; in this narrowest part of its course lies Carlsbad, clean and shining, trim and gay. The town consists of little more than a mile and a half of houses on each side of the river. Occasionally the valley broadens and a tiny extra street is fitted in.	Here and there, the graceful bridges arch over the Tepl, connecting one side of the town with the other. These bridges are often crowded with visitors who pause to admire the scenic beauty or to listen to the musicians who sometimes play there. The buildings are painted in soft pastels, their facades adorned with intricate frescoes and scrolling ironwork, each seeming to tell its own story of elegance and old-world charm. The renowned springs of Carlsbad are scattered throughout the town, each with its own pavilion or colonnade where the health-seeking visitors gather to drink the healing waters. These pavilions are themselves works of art, ranging from ornate structures reminiscent of ancient Greek temples to more modern, but no less beautiful, Art Nouveau styles. In the mornings, the town awakens to the gentle murmur of the river and the soft conversations of early risers strolling along the promenades lined with lush flower beds and elegant lamp posts. The air is crisp and carries the promise of rejuvenation, drawing visitors from their comfortable hotels to partake in the ritual of the	1913	1935.2471
"767 A pause. Miss Glenwilliam took up the fan again, and played with it, considering. ""My father came to my room last night, "" she said, at last, ""in order to speak to me about it. 'Enid, ' he said, 'don't marry that man! — he's a goodenough fellow — but he'll drive a wedge into our life. We can't find a use for him — you and I. He'Ll divide us, my girl — and it isn't worth it — you don't love him!"" And we had a long talk — and at last I told him — I wouldn't — I wouldn't! So you see, Lady Coryston, if I don't marry your son, it's not because you object — but because my father — whom you insulted — doesn't wish me to enter your family — doesn't approve of a marriage with your son — and has persuaded me against it!"" Lady Coryston stared into the face of the speaker, and quailed before the flash of something primitive and savage in the eyes that met her own."	"There was a moment of tense silence between the two, the air thick with unspoken thoughts and the heavy scent of the summer roses wafting through the open window. Lady Coryston's voice, when it finally broke the stillness, was carefully controlled, though a trace of tremor betrayed her agitation. ""Miss Glenwilliam,"" she began, her tone laced with a conciliatory smoothness that poorly masked the iron underneath, ""I understand your position, and I respect the bond between you and your father. It is a sacred one, indeed. However, let me be clear—my intentions were never to insult your father. It was merely a misunderstanding, one I deeply regret."" Enid Glenwilliam's face softened slightly, the fierceness in her eyes dimming as she listened to the older woman's words. Yet, her resolve did not waver, and her response was firm, her voice steady.

The age of dogmatic controversy gave way to an age of externalism. Less and less emphasis was laid on faith and on creed and more on the external manifestations of power, instead of the cultivation of the spiritual life of the people. Now nothing speaks so surely of the decline of a living, character influencing faith, or the vision that is the oxygen of civilization, as the enormous increase in religious temples and external manifestations of theological power, when unaccompanied by a passion for social justice and moral enthusiasm in church and society. And hand in hand with the shifting of the emphasis in religion to its external manifestation; hand in hand with the master appeal being made to the sensuous and intellectual sides of life instead of the wellsprings of emotional being, came the phenomenal material advance, due largely to discovery and invention, that placed the physical resources of the planet in the easy grasp of man.	This material progress, while bringing untold benefits in terms of comfort and convenience, also ushered in new challenges. The rapid expansion of industry and technology often outpaced the moral and ethical development necessary to manage such power wisely. Societies found themselves wrestling with issues of inequality, exploitation, and environmental degradation, all consequences of a predominantly materialistic worldview. As the external trappings of religion grew more elaborate, the core spiritual teachings that aimed to elevate human consciousness and foster a sense of universal brotherhood were often overshadowed. This disconnect between the outer form and the inner essence of religious practice contributed to a growing sense of disillusionment among the people. They witnessed the grandeur of religious ceremonies and the opulence of temples, yet saw little of the transformative power of faith reflected in the lives of the faithful or in societal structures. In such times, the call for a return to the foundational spiritual principles became ever more urgent. There was a need to rekindle the flame of genuine spirituality, which seeks to dissolve barriers, heal divisions, and inspire a commitment to the common good. True religion, many	1911	2007.0985
"And this peril becomes an overshadowing menace when the Court arrogates to itself legislative functions or nullifies legislation enacted for popular  547 protection, by reading into the statute precisely what the great corporation's attorneys desired read into it, but which the Court had previously resolutely refused to do. That even conservative economic authorities realise the danger of the present arrogation of powers that do not properly belong to the courts is well emphasised in the following quotation from Professor J. A. Smith's work on The Spirit of American Government. Professor Smith, who holds the Chair of Political Science in the University of Washington, in writing of the recent tendency toward judicial legislation, says: ""Through the sole right to exercise this power (to interpret the Constitution) our Federal Judiciary has become in reality the controlling branch of our government. Our Supreme Court thus has what virtually amounts to the power to enact as well as the power to annul."	"This dual capacity can lead to a serious imbalance in the separation of powers that is foundational to our democratic system. When one branch of government holds too much power, it can undermine the checks and balances that are meant to prevent any one branch from becoming too dominant. This is particularly concerning when considering that the judiciary is not an elected body, and thus not directly accountable to the electorate in the same way that the legislative and executive branches are. This lack of direct accountability, combined with the power to both interpret and effectively make law, grants the judiciary a potentially despotic level of control over the legal and political landscape of the nation."" Professor Smith continues to argue that the remedy to this situation is not merely legislative or executive intervention, but a structural reevaluation of the powers and limits of the judiciary. He suggests that there needs to be a clearer definition of what constitutes 'judicial overreach,' and mechanisms must be put in place to curtail this when it occurs. Moreover, there should be more transparent and rigorous processes for the appointment and review of judges, ensuring they uphold the constitution without extending their reach into"	1911	1987.8099

"Then I said : "" John, my dear fellow, please listen to me. You know we have now travelled quite 57,000,000 miles on our journey, and that all our arrangements have been made with a view to reaching Mars not later than the 24th of September, because it will then be at the point where it is in opposition to the sun as seen from the earth. It is merely a sentimental reason so far as the opposition is concerned, but there are substantial reasons for not delaying our arrival. "" You say we must go back, but please consider all that such a course must involve. Though the earth has been following us up pretty closely on a slightly different course it is at the present about 13,000,000 miles away from us."	Should we decide to return now, we would be undertaking a journey fraught with as much, if not more, peril than continuing on our current trajectory towards Mars. Furthermore, the resources we have meticulously calculated for this expedition—fuel, food, oxygen—were allocated with the precise intention of reaching Mars by the designated time. Reversing course now would not only jeopardize our supply reserves but also the entire mission’s objectives. Moreover, consider the psychological impact on the crew. The morale, which has been maintained by the shared goal of reaching Mars, might suffer significantly if we suddenly shift our aim. This could lead to decreased efficiency or, worse, critical errors in judgment during this crucial phase of our journey. Lastly, the scientific community and our sponsors have vested immense trust and resources in this project. Turning back without a compelling and critical reason would not only diminish their faith in our capabilities but could also jeopardize future explorations based on the outcomes of this mission. Let us weigh these considerations thoroughly before making a decision that might alter the course of our expedition irreversibly.	1911	1999.4934
"MR. BURGESS (Midland Railway) thought it was important for measurements of horizontal illumination always to be made at the same height from the ground. He gave some figures he had obtained for a high pressure gas installation with inverted mantles, and mentioned a case in which special lighting was needed for shunting in a goods yard. MR. HERBERT JONES (London & Southwestern Railway) suggested that local illumination should always be provided at ticket barriers. He pointed out that there were two distinct classes of station — those that were entirely roofed, in which case flame arc lamps served very well, and those that had separate roofs for each platform, in which case he would use tungsten lamps and reflectors. He exhibited a slide to show the even illumination which had been obtained in the new booking hall at Waterloo Station. MR. A. P. TROTTER thought that a system of "" mixed "" lighting would mean reduced efficiency, and referred to the importance of vertical illumination  24 in such places as goods yards, where labels and other marks had to be decyphered. ME."	E. C. JOHNSON (Great Northern Railway) concurred with Mr. Trotter’s remarks on the necessity of vertical illumination, especially in areas like loading docks and freight sorting zones. He added that, for safety and operational efficiency, it was crucial that the lighting did not create shadows where workers needed to see clearly. He also suggested the integration of portable or adjustable lighting solutions that could be moved and directed as needed during different operations or times of day. MR. CHARLES FLETCHER (Great Western Railway) raised a point about the durability and maintenance of lighting systems in railway environments. He emphasized the need for robust fixtures that could withstand the vibrations and environmental conditions typical of railways. Fletcher proposed that future discussions should include representatives from lighting manufacturers to better understand the advancements in technology that could benefit the railway industry. Finally, MR. WILLIAM THOMSON (Scottish Railways) highlighted the need for a standardized approach to lighting across different railway networks to ensure consistency and safety for both workers and passengers. He suggested forming a committee to develop guidelines that could be adopted by all railway	1912	1996.9596
Meantime, no man in either form of organisation will object to sincere and discriminating criticism. It is such criticism which educates public opinion. Notwithstanding the incidental difficulties, therefore, which arise in the administration of any system of pensions, I believe that the advantages which have resulted from the conferring of pensions have far outweighed the disadvantages and that, furthermore, the advantages on the whole seem likely to become stronger with time, while the disadvantages seem likely to diminish. The value of a pension system depends not only on the intelligence and conscience of those who administer it, but on the spirit and morals of those who are to benefit by it, and the dangers of a pension system lie mainly in those universal dangers which come from human weakness and human selfishness. It is, to my thinking, a fair question whether the college pensions ought not, like other pensions, to carry a contributory feature.	This would not only spread the financial burden more equitably but also increase the sense of ownership and responsibility among the beneficiaries. It is essential that those who gain from such systems contribute in some measure to their maintenance, thereby reinforcing the principle of mutual benefit and shared responsibility. Furthermore, the contributory feature could act as a safeguard against potential abuses, ensuring that the system is valued and not taken for granted. Such considerations are crucial in maintaining the integrity and sustainability of pension systems. Moreover, the implementation of a contributory pension plan could potentially lead to increased engagement and interest in the management and governance of the pension funds. Beneficiaries who contribute to their pensions are more likely to be concerned with how these funds are managed, demanding transparency and accountability from administrators. This heightened scrutiny could lead to more efficient and prudent management of pension resources, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders. In conclusion, while the pension system undoubtedly offers significant benefits, incorporating a contributory aspect could enhance these benefits, foster a greater sense of communal responsibility, and ensure the long-term viability of the system. As we move forward, it is imperative that we	1911	1998.8308
To this rule M. de Tourville has adhered throughout with the result that he has produced a book of surpassing interest which will supply matter for many careful investigations; but on some of the theories the book con  tains, and especially on the great theory of all, the superiority and permanence of the particularist form of society, it is necessary still to maintain an attitude of reserve. Briefly, his account of the rise of the Particularist Family is this. The Celtic shepherds made their way from East to West along the valley of the Danube. The Germans took a more northern route, and as the steppe narrows to the west of Berlin and the fertile lands meet, they were forced or persuaded to a life of agriculture.	The Slavs, meanwhile, spread themselves over the vast expanses of the Eastern plains, retaining a semi-nomadic lifestyle until much later. As these groups settled and adapted to their respective environments, distinct societal structures began to emerge. M. de Tourville argues that it was the adaptation to agriculture and settled life that led to the development of the Particularist Family, characterized by a strong emphasis on local customs, kinship ties, and communal responsibilities. This system, he claims, provided a stable social framework that allowed these communities to thrive and maintain a distinct identity amidst the broader currents of European history. The Particularist Family, according to M. de Tourville, fostered a deep connection to the land and a sense of stewardship, which were crucial for the long-term sustainability of agricultural societies. It also emphasized the importance of family bonds and local traditions, which acted as a bulwark against the centralizing tendencies of more expansive empires. However, while M. de Tourville's narrative is compelling, it is not without its critics. Some scholars argue that his portrayal of	1908	2007.2216
"''This is considering only the economic side: I shall not attempt to tabulate the social and political advantages. They are very great and immensely more important."""	"""Indeed, the broader implications of these ventures far surpass mere financial gain. The fostering of a community spirit, the encouragement of self-reliance, and the promotion of egalitarian principles through equitable land distribution cannot be overstated. These social benefits create a more cohesive society and engender a sense of shared purpose and mutual support among its members."" ""Politically, the advantages are equally profound. By decentralizing resources and reducing the disparity between the wealthy landowners and the landless, we mitigate the risk of social unrest. Furthermore, empowering more citizens with land ownership democratizes economic power, which can lead to more representative governance structures. This in turn cultivates a political environment where policies are more reflective of the collective will and not just the interests of a privileged few."" ""Thus, while the economic benefits are significant and provide a strong incentive on their own, the social and political advantages offer a compelling case for the expansion of small holdings. These broader impacts can ultimately lead to a more stable, just, and prosperous society."""	1911	1994.2035
Here we found a large concourse of people assembled, and their numbers were being added to by fresh arrivals every minute. On looking upwards we saw air ships speeding towards us from every quarter. Some brought passengers and landed them, but it was evident that most of the air ships were about to take part in the display, as they remained up in the air instead of coming down to the ground. We met many Martians whom we knew, and were introduced to others, so the time passed quickly in interesting conversation. As soon as darkness fell Merna informed us that the display was about to commence, adding that he had purposely refrained from giving us any inkling of its nature, as he thought the unexpected would afford us greater pleasure.	"The lights dimmed, and a hush fell over the crowd as everyone's eyes turned skyward. Suddenly, the night erupted in a symphony of colors as the air ships began their ballet. Streams of light poured from them, weaving intricate patterns across the canvas of the dark sky. Each ship emitted different hues, creating a kaleidoscope of brilliant, dancing lights that mesmerized the onlookers. Merna leaned over and whispered, ""Each ship is piloted by a master flyer, and the patterns are a traditional Martian art form, passed down through generations."" The display was not merely for beauty; it was a cultural expression, a dance of heritage and pride. The air ships moved with such precision and grace that they seemed to be alive, responding to an unseen conductor's baton. As the performance reached its crescendo, the ships converged to form a massive, glowing figure in the sky—a symbol of unity and peace recognizable to all Martians. The crowd erupted in applause, the sound rolling like thunder across the assembly. We felt a deep sense of awe and connection, not"	1911	1983.2875
"Art will always be considered somewhat effeminate and abnormal during a commercial or martial period. 999 M. ClOLKOWSKI. CAGES FOR HUSBANDS. To Ike Editor of THE FREEWOMAN. MADAM, — Mr. Gallichan believes ''that if wives would construct cages for husbands as skilfully as they spread nets for them, we should hear much less of husbands reverting to the ephemeral amours of their bachelor days."" Of course, we should. Caged men would be as faithful as caged women are. But is it worth while ? It is nearly as boring to be a gaoler as to be a prisoner. Has it ever suggested itself to Mr. Gallichan that a wife's reward for perennial manoeuvring hardly justifies the exertion, or that a woman's passion may be as ephemeral as a man's ?"	Indeed, the very notion of constructing cages, metaphorical or literal, to maintain fidelity seems to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of human relationships and desires. True companionship cannot be enforced by constraints but should rather be a mutual agreement of respect and affection. The implication that either spouse needs to trap or be trapped to preserve a marriage not only undermines the agency of both parties but also paints a grim picture of matrimonial life. Furthermore, the idea that fidelity can be secured through containment is a disservice to the concept of trust, which is the cornerstone of any strong relationship. If the foundation of a marriage is so fragile that it requires constant surveillance and restriction, one must question the viability and health of such a union. Mr. Gallichan's proposition, while possibly well-intentioned, seems to echo outdated notions that view marriage more as an ownership contract than a partnership. It is high time we move beyond these archaic views and foster relationships based on mutual understanding, freedom, and genuine connection. Only then can both partners truly thrive, unencumbered by the fear of infidelity or the weight	1911	2007.3557
In addition, several states of the union, the last of which is Wisconsin, have inaugurated pension systems for public school teachers, maintained in considerable part by deductions from the salary of the individual. Before the establishment of the Carnegie Foundation, pension systems for teachers, quite limited in their provisions, were in operation in the University of California, Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, mcgill University and Yale University. Pension systems have since been instituted in Haverford College and for those teachers connected with Teachers College at Columbia University who do not come within the rules of the foundation. In most of these colleges the entire pension was to be paid by the institution. In some of them — as, for instance, at Cornell — the pension was to be paid in part from an endowment fund and in part from the payments of the professors.	This mixed model of funding has been adopted by several other institutions as well, reflecting a growing trend towards securing financial stability for educators in their retirement years. The system at Cornell, and similar ones at other universities, often involve a percentage contribution from the salaries of the professors themselves, alongside substantial contributions from the university’s endowment funds. This ensures a sustained pool of resources to support pensions. Moreover, the involvement of the Carnegie Foundation has significantly influenced the expansion and standardization of pension systems across higher education institutions. The foundation's commitment to improving the welfare of educators has led to more robust and equitable pension plans, which often include provisions for disability and survivor benefits, enhancing the overall appeal of academic careers. The evolution of these pension plans is part of a broader movement towards recognizing the importance of teacher welfare in the academic sector. As these systems become more widespread, they not only provide security for individual teachers but also enhance the ability of institutions to attract and retain top talent. The adoption of comprehensive pension plans is seen as an essential component of a competitive benefits package in the increasingly global market for academic professionals.	1911	2003.0995

To find the maximum deflection, we set the derivative of the deflection equation to zero and solve for x. This will give the position x at which the deflection is maximum. By substituting this value back into the deflection equation, we can calculate the maximum deflection. For the beam in Fig. 68, consider the total distributed load w acting over the length L of the beam. The maximum deflection in a simply supported beam under a uniformly distributed load occurs at the midspan (x = L/2). Using the formula for maximum deflection under a uniformly distributed load, which is Δ_max = -5wL^4 / (384EI), where E is the modulus of elasticity and I is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-sectional area. If additional point loads or varying distributed loads are present, the calculation would need to incorporate these factors into the bending moment equations and subsequently into the deflection calculations. The superposition principle can be used if the loads are linearly additive, which allows the individual deflections	1908	1985.0607
"Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors did not arrive at the alphabet, or at the Nicene Creed, by traversing a long series of stages; they leapt to the one and to the other."" — Domesday Book and Beyond, p. 345. we know for certain that particular stages are earlier than others, and if we give that knowledge practical effect. With societies, as with individuals, mental progress — and therefore the progress of institutions corresponding to ideas — proceeds at extraordinarily different rates of speed. Not only do direct transmission and imitation transform normal growth but like conditions leading to like functions are found at very different stages of culture. The conception, however, of a normal political growth, which must be carefully handled if the results are not to be noxious and dangerous, has a deep political importance in such an Empire as ours, comprising, as it does, races in very various stages — perhaps in every stage — of political development."	This notion of a predetermined sequence in societal evolution, though seductive in its simplicity, can obscure the rich particularities and potentialities inherent in each culture's unique path. It is crucial in the administration of such a diverse empire to recognize and respect these differences, rather than imposing a monolithic standard of progress. The history of colonial governance is replete with examples of the failure to adhere to this principle, leading to resistance, resentment, and a breakdown of the very institutions intended to foster stability and growth. In managing such a variety of political entities, the approach must be one of nuanced engagement rather than prescriptive imposition. This involves a careful study of the local conditions and an understanding of the historical trajectories that have shaped these conditions. It also means fostering local leadership and institutions that resonate with the cultural and historical context of each society within the empire. Furthermore, recognizing that political evolution is non-linear and contingent can help in formulating policies that are flexible and adaptive, rather than rigid and uniform. This adaptive approach should aim to facilitate organic growth within each society, supporting initiatives that are culturally congruent and locally	1908	2006.4279

This criticism may be summed up in the statement that the college does not make good. Its output is woefully disappointing. Its business is to prepare young men and women for effective living in their time and place, to equip them for the responsibilities and duties which every generation in turn must meet and discharge if the standards of civilization are to be maintained and pushed forward. The charge is that college graduates do not meet the test; they do not measure up to the requirements; they are deficient in those very qualities which the higher education is supposed especially to nurture. Professor Barrows would frankly accept the situation: the fact is mainly true; the explanation is that too much has been expected of the , college. College students are too immature.	They come to the institution without the necessary groundwork, without those habits of discipline and focus essential for intellectual development. Moreover, the curriculum often remains disconnected from real-world applications, leaving students ill-prepared for the practical challenges they face upon graduation. The college tries to be all things to all people, and in the process, it fails to serve the specific needs of its students effectively. Professor Barrows suggests a reevaluation of the educational objectives and a restructuring of the academic programs to foster a more direct connection between the students' studies and the demands of contemporary society. He advocates for a greater emphasis on experiential learning—internships, cooperative education, service learning—that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Additionally, there should be a stronger focus on teaching critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are universally acknowledged as vital for success in any field. The college must also address the issue of student maturity directly. This could involve integrating more life skills training into the curriculum and providing greater support and guidance to help students develop the personal and professional competencies they need. Only by making	1911	1993.0592
The College of Physicians and Surgeons was no less positive in the conviction expressed, that the proper scientific treatment of smallpox was by inoculating the healthy individual with the deadly disease, than are the so-called regular doctors obsessed with the idea that serum therapy is the scientific treatment for various diseases today; and every attempt possible is being made to hide from the people the deadly effect that so frequently follows the inoculation of patients with the various serums, while an industrious effort is being made to convey the idea that in serums is to be found the cure for such diseases as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, etc. We are told that the successful use of these serums in the English and German armies demonstrates the truth of the contention. On this point the recently published statement of one who knows is interesting.	He asserts that while there have been some successes, the general adoption of serum therapy has also led to numerous complications and adverse reactions that are often underreported. The narrative of serums as a panacea is thus challenged by these quieter voices from the field, who argue that the reliance on such treatments may overshadow other, perhaps more effective, preventive measures such as sanitation, nutrition, and broader public health initiatives. Moreover, there is a growing concern among some medical professionals and scholars about the long-term effects of serum therapy. Questions are being raised about the impact on the immune system, the potential for developing resistance, and the ethical implications of mass inoculations without fully understanding the possible consequences. These concerns echo the historical debates on inoculation practices, reminding us that while science advances, the ethical and practical considerations remain complex and multifaceted. Thus, while serum therapy continues to be heralded in some quarters as a breakthrough, it is evident that more balanced discussions and comprehensive evaluations are necessary. This includes not only clinical trials and medical research but also a broader dialogue with the public about the risks, benefits, and	1911	2006.2318
Only the most obvious facts of biology are needed for this purpose, and they are of importance not to help observation, but to point out remedies. That riches caused men to degenerate and that poverty retards the development of the poor are well established facts. They show that states of surplus and deficit affect not only moral traits but also create degeneration and retardation. Psychology, however, has added a clearly defined cause of non development which had escaped notice. The growth of an organ depends partly on the direction given to growth by the unit characters of the germ cell and partly to the use to which it is put. Even if the forces of the germ cell are normal no organ will fully develop without constant exercise. Regression in an organ will take place if the stimuli to exercise are absent. These stimuli lie not in the organ, but in the brain cells.	Therefore, the environment plays a critical role in fostering or hindering the development of these stimuli. When the surrounding conditions fail to provide adequate or appropriate challenges that engage the organ, regression or atrophy can occur as the biological response to underuse. Conversely, when the environment is rich in stimuli that encourage repeated and varied use of an organ, there is a corresponding enhancement in its development and functionality. This relationship between environment, brain activity, and organ development is pivotal in understanding both individual and societal health. This dynamic also underscores the importance of creating environments that stimulate mental and physical growth across different demographics. Educational and social policies need to be crafted with an understanding of these biological principles, ensuring that all individuals have access to environments that encourage the full development of their potential. This not only promotes better health on an individual level but also contributes to the overall vitality and productivity of the community, reducing the societal costs associated with healthcare and lost productivity due to underdeveloped potential.	1911	2007.118
today Germany is revolutionised. Her commerce and industry fluctuate with the crop seasons and the market seasons all over the world, and any one who goes into the money market, or on the Bourse, to buy or sell currency has to meet the competition of enormous banking systems that have grown up with the commercial evolution and extend with it into foreign countries. today, therefore, the management of such a wholesale money agency has immense difficulties to face. In their agricultural capacity the joint societies are buyers of goods in extremely high standing. They are sellers of produce of which they know the worth and which they have the ability to hold. In their financial capacity they are buyers of money with none too fat pockets; they are sellers of money with none too expert a knowledge of its value and habits.	Thus, they find themselves in a precarious position, balancing between the necessity to secure favorable terms for their agricultural products and the need to navigate the complexities of international finance. Their dual role demands acute business acumen and a deep understanding of both local agricultural markets and global financial trends. The rapid industrialization and urbanization of Germany have also transformed the traditional economic structures, placing additional pressures on these societies. They must adapt to the changing dynamics, where the swift flow of capital and the volatility of markets can dramatically affect their operations overnight. Moreover, the expansion of German commerce has led to increased governmental regulation and oversight, further complicating the landscape these societies must navigate. Compliance with both national and international financial regulations requires sophisticated legal and financial expertise, adding to the operational costs and reducing the margins. The challenge is not only to manage these immediate complexities but also to foresee and adapt to future economic shifts. The societies must invest in technology and expertise to improve their market analysis and financial strategies, ensuring they can withstand and capitalize on the fluctuations of the global economy. This strategic adaptation is crucial for their survival and growth in an	1913	2004.6741
"That the statesmen who really represent the conscience side of life, the true patriots who believe in popular sovereignty, recognise this to be the supreme issue is seen in their readiness to take up the gauge of battle and refuse to be led off into the byways of subordinate issues. On every hand the voice of these statesmen of the new day is electrifying the nation, even as Jefferson, and later Lincoln, electrified and heartened the friends of popular sovereignty in the crucial hours of our earlier history. 266 United States Senator Works' Outspoken Stand for Popular Sovereignty Thus, for example, we find United States Senator John D. Works, of California, on April 20th, in defending the right of Arizona to enter the sisterhood of states with a constitution that guarantees popular representative government, clearly setting forth the real issue in the nation wide battle between the despotism of privileged wealth and corrupt politics, on the one hand, and popular government on the other, in these timely words: ""What is the real objection to the constitution ?"	"Is it not that it contains provisions which seem too radical, too favorable to the masses, and perhaps threatening to entrenched interests and the established order of things? But should we not consider that the very essence of democracy is to allow for the expression of the people's will, even if it challenges the status quo? Arizona seeks to embody this spirit of democracy in its constitution by ensuring that the government remains accountable to its citizens, not just in theory but in practice."" Senator Works continued, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the principles upon which the nation was founded: ""We must remember that our forefathers fought and established this nation on the premise of representation and freedom from tyranny. If we deny Arizona—or any state—the right to shape their government in accordance with the will of its people, are we not then betraying those very principles? It is not merely Arizona's battle; it is America's battle."" He concluded with a powerful call to action, urging his fellow lawmakers to consider the broader implications of their decisions: ""Let us not be swayed by fear or favor toward powerful interests.

"Most of the smaller guns were out of action, though the 6 in. guns in the casemates of the British ships were still for the most part intact. The Sultan s 7.5's were firing with great effect ; while the Captain, which headed the British main division, had resisted the battering superbly, and inflicted great injury on the Preussen by her fire. At moments, however, her guns were blanketed by the ships behind her, from the fact that the German columns were well astern. It was to bring his guns to bear as well as to rejoin his commander-in-chief that the British Vice-Admiral altered course and steamed southwestward. The Germans now practised a masterly stroke. Their third division of six "" Kaisers "" headed direct for the van of the British line, closing rapidly upon a generally opposite course."	This maneuver positioned them to rake the British ships from the beam, a vulnerable angle for any vessel. The British, realizing the precariousness of their situation, responded with a counter-maneuver. The Vice-Admiral ordered a sudden turn to starboard, intending to bring his broadsides to bear and simultaneously align his ships into a more defensible line-ahead formation. Amidst the booming of cannons and the thick smoke that enveloped the fleets, the sea was churned by the swift movements of steel behemoths. The German ships, however, were relentless. Their lead vessel, the Kaiser Wilhelm, unleashed a volley that struck the British flagship, causing significant damage to her upper works and temporarily disabling two of her forward guns. Despite the damage, the spirit of the British crew was unbroken. Gun crews worked feverishly to clear debris and repair the damaged artillery, while others returned fire with whatever guns remained operational. The air was heavy with the smell of gunpowder and the screams of orders being shouted over the din of battle. As the German ships closed in,	1906	1942.345
It will be generally admitted that one of the main purposes to be served by modern street illumination is the guidance of fast moving traffic. Yet it cannot be said that the present methods are schemed out for this purpose. More brilliant illuminants have from time to time been substituted on the existing lamp posts, but the scientific study of the direction and distribution of light, the avoidance of the effects of glare, chas hardly been touched as yet. It is true that tests on various forms of lamps are from time to time carried out in our streets, but they are devised mainly with a view to comparative economy, and really radical experiments and innovations (such as must always be the forerunners of genuine improvement) are rarely attempted. Moreover, the fact of the lighting of London resting in the hands of so many local authorities leads to much repetition of experiments and to chaotic results, each district adopting certain forms of illuminants which possibly suit their local requirements, but are not necessarily the best for guiding the traffic in our main arteries.	This fragmentation of responsibility and lack of a unified approach means that the capital's street lighting system is less effective than it could be. A more centralized system, with a single authority overseeing street lighting across all boroughs, would allow for a more coherent and scientifically informed approach. This authority could standardize the types of lamps used, their placement, and their maintenance, ensuring that all areas of the city are equally well-lit according to the needs of modern traffic and pedestrian safety. The ideal solution would involve a comprehensive survey of the existing lighting conditions and traffic patterns. From this data, a tailored lighting plan could be developed, focusing on the intensity, color temperature, and angle of the lights to minimize glare and maximize visibility. Special attention should be given to intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other areas where accidents are more likely to occur. Furthermore, advancements in lighting technology, such as LED lights, offer significant benefits in terms of both energy efficiency and light control. These technologies allow for better management of light distribution, reducing light pollution while improving visibility on the streets. The adoption of smart lighting systems, which can	1912	2005.3063
"Beyond them were yet others directed north. There were field batteries and big 4.7^. All were hard at work, their gunners working like men possessed, and the crash of their constant discharge was earsplitting. I had hardly taken this in when "" Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! """	four rapid shots rang out from the nearest battery, each followed by a thick cloud of smoke that momentarily obscured the view. The air was heavy with the smell of gunpowder and the ground vibrated under the relentless pounding of artillery. Shells whistled overhead, their trajectories marked by streaks of fire as they hurtled towards their targets in the distance. The men at the guns were a study in controlled urgency, their movements precise and automatic. Sweat streaked their faces, mixing with the grime of battle, but their eyes remained focused and unyielding. They loaded, aimed, and fired with a rhythm that was almost mechanical, yet each action was infused with a desperate intensity. As I watched, a young lieutenant, his uniform stained and tattered, shouted commands over the cacophony. His voice, hoarse from yelling, barely carried over the din, but the gunners responded with practiced efficiency. Every now and then, he would glance up at the sky, as if searching for some sign or calculation that only he could discern. The scene was one of chaotic precision	1906	1989.3435
The silk thread industry at Leek was ruined, so was the silk industry at Macclesfield ; the great breweries at Burton were idle, while the hosiery factories of Leicester and the boot factories of Northampton were all shut. With the German troops threatening Sheffield, Nottingham was in a state of intense alarm. The lace and hosiery factories had with one accord closed on Tuesday, and the great Market Place was now filled day and night by thousands upon thousands of unemployed mill hands of both sexes. On Friday, however, came the news of how Sheffield had built barricades against the enemy, and there ensued a frantic attempt at defence on the part of thousands of terrified and hungry men and women.	They hastily gathered whatever materials they could find—old furniture, barrels, bricks—and piled them high across the streets leading into the city center. The atmosphere was charged with fear and desperation, but also with a fierce determination to protect their homes and livelihoods. In the midst of this chaos, community leaders tried to organize the makeshift defenses, rallying the citizens with impassioned speeches about courage and resilience. The local constabulary, stretched thin and equally frightened, did their best to maintain some semblance of order, directing the construction of barricades and establishing lookout points. Volunteers from among the citizenry were enlisted to keep watch through the night, their eyes straining in the darkness for any sign of the advancing enemy. Meanwhile, families huddled in their homes, curtains drawn and lights dimmed, whispering stories of bravery and plans for escape should the worst come to pass. The city, known for its vibrant industry and bustling markets, was now a shadow of its former self, gripped by the terror of war yet united in a common cause. Each passing hour was a testament to their resolve,	1906	1980.9742
Mrs. Wilson remembered the Wilson terrapin, and sent for the caterer. He had been reading the paper. The Duke of Denford to marry a daughter of the other Wilson! Why, they'd  723 grown up side by side, he might say, for generations, the Gordons and the Will sons — were buried in the same graveyard. He talked to his wife of a proud equality, but the telephone summons carried him to the Fifth Avenue house in his everyday humility. He waited for Mrs. Wilson in the Louis Quinze reception room. It gave him an undefined pleasure to see how small the room was, after all. And the chairs, too, were absurd. He could remember some black walnut chairs in the old house in England that were chairs! And tables made of mahogany that you could lean on, not gilded sticks as 'd crack if you looked at them! He heard the swish of silken skirts in the hall, and found himself bowing obsequiously to the descendant of the von Hoocks. When the courses were disposed of he asked his patron what she would need.	"Mrs. Wilson, with a slight air of distraction, waved her hand dismissively at the array of silver and porcelain that glittered on the sideboard. ""Oh, it's not about the dinnerware or the arrangements, Mr. Jenkins,"" she said, her tone carrying a hint of urgency. ""I need something quite different. The Duke will be here tomorrow, and I must have something... unique."" Mr. Jenkins, always keen to accommodate, straightened his posture slightly, his mind already racing through possibilities. ""Of course, Mrs. Wilson. May I suggest something along the lines of an exotic dish? Perhaps something that isn't typically found in our local cuisine?"" ""That might do,"" she murmured, tapping her chin thoughtfully. ""But it must be more than just exotic. It should be memorable. A dish that speaks of sophistication and heritage. Think, Mr. Jenkins, of something truly special."" He nodded, understanding the assignment's gravity. ""Perhaps, then, a dish that incorporates both the local flavors and something from the Duke's homeland? A fusion that signifies the"	1913	1959.7777

Following are some figures. In 1892 the Chemical National Bank of New York reported as follows: (See Report of U. S. Comptroller of Currency, Vol. 2, p. 758) : Capital stock (paid in) $300,000 Undivided profits 997,000 Surplus fund 6,000,000 Individual deposits 23,000,000 Loans and discounts 23,000,000 Thus it appears upon a capital of $300,000, by the use of bank credits based almost wholly upon other people's money (cash deposits) and under the system of redeposits (loan deposits), . . .	the bank was able to leverage significantly, extending loans and discounts to the same magnitude as its total individual deposits. This demonstrates the power of fractional-reserve banking, where banks are able to multiply the initial deposits through the loaning process, thereby increasing the money supply within the economy. This system, while potent in expanding economic activity, also necessitates careful regulation and oversight to prevent excessive risk-taking that could lead to financial instability. The Chemical National Bank's ability to maintain such a high level of loans and discounts relative to its capital shows a robust use of the banking mechanism to support commercial activities. The surplus fund, being twenty times the paid-in capital, indicates a strong buffer and a healthy financial position, which is crucial for absorbing potential losses and protecting depositors. This model of banking, reflected in the operations of the Chemical National Bank and similar institutions, plays a pivotal role in economic growth by facilitating credit creation. It allows businesses to expand and invest beyond their immediate cash reserves, driving employment and productivity. However, the reliance on redeposits also underscores the importance of depositor confidence and the need for	1911	1988.0543
in Table 9. Each row decreases from right to left, corresponding to closer and closer positions to the centre of the wind system. Conversely, cyclonic velocities increase with greater and greater distances from the centre, if the isobar spacings remain unchanged. In nature, cyclonic isobar spacings very frequently become smaller and smaller as the centre of the system is approached, resulting in more uniform velocities throughout the area dominated by the circulation. There is no limiting velocity in the cyclone. The reason for this lies in the fact that the pressure gradient instead of the deflective force is directed inward. Both centrifugal force and deflective force are directed outward and serve as a balance for the pressure gradient.	As a result, the wind speed within a cyclone can intensify significantly as it moves toward the center where the pressure gradient is steepest. This is why the wind speeds near the eye of a cyclone can be extremely high, and yet, paradoxically, the eye itself is a region of calm. The dynamics of this phenomenon are further influenced by the Coriolis effect, which causes the winds to spiral rather than flow directly inward. This spiraling motion contributes to the maintenance of the cyclone structure and allows it to continue drawing energy from the warm ocean waters beneath, especially in tropical regions. The temperature differential between different layers of the atmosphere also plays a crucial role in the development and sustenance of cyclonic systems. Warmer air rises and cooler air descends, creating convection currents that fuel the cyclone's rotational energy. Furthermore, as the cyclone moves over the ocean, it can draw in more warm, moist air from the surface, which then cools and condenses to form clouds and precipitation, releasing latent heat in the process. This release of heat further lowers	1913	2001.3987
What others have done can never decide the question of our conscience what we ought to do. Also that group of inquiries concerning the means of welfare leads us no further on. That a certain act serves our well-being, or serves the well-being of the greatest number is, indeed, a scientific fact which we may study by observation. But the question is just whether we ought to serve our own pleasure, or, perhaps, the pleasure of the greatest number, or whether we ought to seek quite different aims. Ethics becomes biology and social psychology only if we silently take for granted that we have no other obligations than to do what is agreeable to us. now that may be a wise or a foolish ethical doctrine; it is certainly a definite doctrine which may be accepted or rejected. But whether we ought to accept or reject it, cannot be concluded by mere observations of facts.	Ethics, then, in its purest form, transcends the empirical realm of observed facts and enters the domain of philosophy and reasoning about morality. It deals with imperatives—what ought to be—rather than indicatives—what is. This distinction is crucial, for it separates ethical reasoning from mere sociological or psychological analysis, which, while valuable, do not address the core questions of moral philosophy. The challenge of ethics is to establish a framework within which we can evaluate our actions and intentions against a set of moral principles or values that are justified independently of empirical evidence. It seeks to answer not just what effects our actions will have, but what we should do, regardless of the consequences. This involves a deep inquiry into the nature of right and wrong, good and evil, and the moral worth of intentions and outcomes. Moreover, ethics involves a commitment to a certain level of universality. That is, if an action is right or wrong for one person in a given situation, it should be right or wrong for anyone in a similar situation. This universality challenges us to look beyond personal	1909	2003.9579
It was, of course, known that practically the whole of the Norfolk and Suffolk coast was already held by the enemy, but with the exception of the fact that the enemy's cavalry vedettes and reconnoitring patrols were out everywhere at a distance about twenty miles from the shore, England was entirely in the dark as to what had occurred anywhere else but at Lowestoft. Attempts similar to that of the Ipswich cyclist volunteers had been made to penetrate the cavalry screen at various points, but in vain. What was in progress was carefully kept a secret by the enemy. The veil was, however, now lifted.	News leaked through small, unnoticed gaps in the enemy's otherwise tight security. A local fisherman, having ventured too close to a secured zone along a less patrolled section of the coast, happened to overhear conversations among a group of enemy soldiers. Hurriedly rowing back to the mainland under the cover of night, he brought with him tales of heavy artillery being moved inland and whispers of a planned assault on a major city. The gravity of the situation became apparent. The enemy was not merely establishing a defensive position along the coast but preparing for a significant offensive operation. The local defense committees, previously operating in a state of relative disorganization, were galvanized into action by the fisherman's report. Swiftly, messengers were dispatched to relay the critical information to military headquarters in London. The British forces, realizing the strategic disadvantage of their current lack of information, intensified their reconnaissance efforts. Small, highly skilled teams of scouts were deployed beyond the enemy's cavalry screen under the veil of darkness. Their mission was to gather as much intelligence as possible about the enemy's movements and intentions. As	1906	1980.9769
"This is not the case with sex as commonly experienced on a semi physical basis. The body defeats the experience, as one naturally might expect. The acutest bodily sensation realised, there is nothing left over to experience in the region of the physical. Its next stage must be found in the mental, and the mental cannot be reached through the physical. The mental can include the physical, but the physical cannot include the mental, and it is the prolongation of the mental experience which is desired, even as low down in the scale of human sex passion as we find it in the "" born "" prostitute type. The physical is a prison to sense, even with those who make their ultimate appeals through it."	The dilemma faced by those entrenched in purely physical pursuit of pleasure is that they often reach a point of diminishing returns. The physical act, while initially thrilling and satisfying, can become repetitive and unfulfilling without deeper emotional or intellectual engagement. This realization can lead to a profound sense of emptiness, as the limitations of physical gratification become apparent. The pursuit then, for those seeking a more meaningful and lasting satisfaction, must shift towards the mental and emotional realms. It is here that the complexities of human interaction, the subtleties of emotional connection, and the stimulation of intellectual engagement provide a richer, more layered experience. The mental and emotional connections can enhance and deepen the physical experience, making it something more than mere sensation. For instance, in a relationship where both partners are attuned not only to each other's bodies but also to each other's minds and spirits, the physical act of love becomes a profound form of communication and bonding. It transcends the act itself and becomes an expression of deeper feelings and mutual respect. This is the kind of experience that can provide lasting satisfaction and continual renewal	1911	2002.1246
If these essentials were considered in the order given, there would be fewer cases of hardships and less litigation over contract rights. The mischief frequently results from the parties mutually consenting to be bound and exchanging the considerations before the questions of competency of the parties and the legality of the act undertaken have oeen considered. The order adopted is that usually followed in written contracts. The author has followed, ‘as closely as a liberal treatment would seem to permit, the lines of an engineering and architectural construction contract, and throughout, so far as possible, he has cited cases that have arisen under such contracts. 3. The Introduction to a C0ntract. — Coutracts are generally begun by introductory clauses peculiar to the law, though no special form is required. The forms employed are as various and eccentric as the persons who frame them; but of them all, it is submitted that either of the following forms will answer in any contract for construction work: [Heading] “THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into [concluded] this . . . . . . . . . ..day of........., ....in the year and between . . . . . . . . . . . .

It may also include clauses on dispute resolution, termination conditions, and penalties for non-compliance. Each term should be clearly defined to avoid ambiguity and ensure that all parties have a common understanding of their obligations.

At this age girls will be ripe to specialise in motherhood, and will, therefore, begin receiving their £100 a year. As Mr. Wells sees no reason why women should not specialise in motherhood as a profession, it is to be presumed they will do so until the age of about forty, when Nature will affix her limit. At this age, not having received any other training, such women will have claims on the State for continued maintenance, which they would receive, according to Mr. Wells, from the State as a special form of old age pension. So practically all females would be State maintained from birth till death. Even such as were deranged, sickly, or criminal would be maintained in asylum, hospital, or prison. So, too, would defective males, as well as all males until eighteen or twenty-one years. Mr. Wells says that the community already does support all non productive females and children.	He argues that this is not a matter of sentiment but of sheer necessity for the preservation of the species. The extension of this principle to include all women as state-supported mothers, he suggests, is merely a logical progression. Furthermore, Mr. Wells proposes that by recognizing motherhood as a profession, society would place a value on the indispensable role women play in the nurturing and rearing of future generations. This would not only provide women with a dignified and acknowledged career but would also ensure that children are brought up in environments that are stable and conducive to their development. In his vision, the specialization in motherhood would be supported by comprehensive education programs that focus on child development, nutrition, and health care, thus equipping women with the knowledge and skills necessary to raise healthy, well-adjusted children. This would, in turn, benefit society by fostering a healthier, more educated populace. Critics of Mr. Wells' proposal might argue that it pigeonholes women into traditional roles, potentially limiting their personal and professional choices. Others might question the economic feasibility of such a system. However, proponents see it	1911	2003.7147
They pretended that they were rich merchants from Philadelphia, dressed in costly clothes, and wore wigs and ruffles. They would seek acquaintance with a merchant in Holland and agree with him upon a sum for every person persuaded to remove. They described Pennsylvania as a land of Elysian fields flowing with milk and honey, where gold and silver could be picked up on the hills, and servants could become independent and live like noblemen. The simple German peasant would often sell his belongings and trust himself to the mercy of the soul seller.	Once the contract was signed, the peasant would embark on a perilous journey across the Atlantic, filled with high hopes and dreams of prosperity. Little did they know, the reality awaiting them was starkly different from the paradise painted by the soul sellers. Upon arrival, these immigrants found themselves indentured, bound to years of servitude to pay off the cost of their passage. The promises of wealth and freedom were nowhere to be seen, replaced instead by hard labor and harsh conditions. The soul sellers, meanwhile, would return to Europe with their pockets lined, ready to spin their tales to the next batch of hopeful settlers. The cycle of deception continued, fueled by the desperation of those seeking a better life and the greed of those willing to exploit it. It was a grim chapter in the history of immigration, marked by exploitation and broken dreams.	1913	1979.1461
Then came the days of Lyell, Agassiz, Darwin, Wallace and their many illustrious contemporaries, and zoologists began to realise the magnitude of their field and the multiplicity of its problems. No such sudden enlargement of the field for zoological research had ever occurred before and probably never will again. It was natural, therefore, that many zoologists working on the frontiers of the new territory should not merely lose sight of their fellows, who had not travelled so far, or who had journeyed in different directions, but should also lose sympathy with them. Although the lazy, the easy going, the incompetent, do as a rule lag behind when a new country is opened, those who remain in the old fields do not usually do so from laziness or incompetence, Charlatans and self seekers are conspicuous in frontier communities, but, of course, the majority of those at the front are not such. A man's motives may be the highest and the quality of his work the best, regardless of whether he remains in the old fields or seeks to push the frontier further on.	The intellectual ferment and excitement brought about by these pioneering naturalists was palpable. They introduced concepts that challenged and expanded the existing paradigms, driving a wave of innovation in biological sciences. This was a period marked by intense debate and reevaluation of fundamental principles that had been held as immutable truths for centuries. As the field expanded, it became increasingly apparent that biology was not a static entity but a dynamic and ever-evolving discipline, influenced by myriad forces both internal and external. The introduction of evolutionary theory, for example, not only revolutionized how we understand the development of life forms but also how we perceive our own place in the natural world. It forced a reconsideration of the hierarchical structures that had dominated biological thought and suggested a more interconnected and interdependent view of life. This period of scientific enlightenment was not without its challenges. As the frontiers of knowledge expanded, so too did the complexity of the problems faced by researchers. Specialization became necessary as no single individual could hope to master all the new material. This led to some degree of fragmentation within the scientific community as researchers delved deeper	1911	2006.3358
"Those who continue to believe that there is a future for the church base their optimistic confidence upon the fact of what the late Professor John Fiske used to call ""the everlasting reality of religion."" Mr. Fiske's religion and his idea of God were not those of the traditional religionist, and neither are the beliefs and convictions of the more modern liberal religious thinker those of Professor Fiske. The world moves, and religious thought advances with it. Despite the protests of the ""stand pat"" theologian, the conviction has become deep rooted in the minds of most modern thinkers that the forces symbolised by the word ""religion"" are not static, but dynamic; that the term ""God"" is constantly receiving new interpretation — a new content."	This evolution in religious thought corresponds to the broader shifts in cultural and intellectual perspectives that characterize the modern era. It embraces the sciences and humanities, weaving them into a more comprehensive understanding of the divine. The liberal theologian sees God not as a distant figure presiding over an unchanging order, but as an immanent presence within the ongoing process of creation and discovery. This view aligns with the concept of a universe in flux, where divine interaction is continuous, allowing for growth and change. The fresh interpretations of spirituality and divinity reflect a move away from dogmatic prescriptions to a more experiential and personal approach. Individuals are encouraged to seek their own spiritual paths, drawing on a variety of religious traditions and philosophies. This pluralistic approach acknowledges the diverse ways in which different cultures and individuals experience the sacred, suggesting that the essence of spirituality lies in its ability to adapt and resonate with the changing needs of humanity. Thus, the future of the church, according to modern liberal thinkers, depends not on clinging to outdated doctrines but on embracing change and fostering an environment where diverse spiritual practices and ideas can	1911	2007.6234
The teacher would be obliged to stand by and wait for the natural growth. What could he do to change the resounding of the mind if nature caused such or such a wave of organic excitement to spread over the nervous system ? He could not change candy tasting agreeably and cod liver oil disagreeably any more than he could change the grass looking green and the sky blue. There would be no handle and no hook by which the feelings could be grasped. Even admonitions and punishments could not better the situation. The teacher would have to confess that, while he might compel the child or persuade the child to swallow the disgusting cod liver oil in spite of his dislike, he would not be able to change the displeasure into pleasure. The ordinary view of feelings forces on the teacher, if he thinks about it consistently at all, a discouraging pessimism.	He would see his role as largely passive, a mere observer of the inevitable unfolding of innate predispositions and reactions. This perspective, while it acknowledges the biological bases of sensation, severely limits the scope of educational influence. It suggests that the teacher's efforts to mold or refine the student's emotional and sensory experiences are ultimately futile, bound by the rigid framework of biological determinism. Yet, this need not be the final word on the matter. While it is true that certain basic sensory responses and emotional reactions are hardwired, education plays a crucial role in shaping how these reactions are understood, managed, and integrated into one's broader psychological and moral framework. The teacher can introduce the child to a wider range of experiences, help them articulate their feelings, and guide them in reflecting on their responses. Through stories, discussions, and guided reflections, a teacher can help students see beyond immediate sensory reactions and to appreciate the reasons why certain experiences, though initially unpleasant, might be valuable or necessary. Furthermore, the development of emotional regulation and the cultivation of virtues such as patience, courage, and resilience can also alter	1909	2007.5876
Through those unlit side streets between the Kentish Town and Camden Roads — namely, the Lawford, Bartholomew, Rochester, Caversham, and Leighton Roads, there was much skirmishing, and many on both sides fell in the bloody encounter. A thousand deeds of bravery were done that night, but were unrecorded. Before the barricade in the Holloway Road — which had been strongly repaired after the breach made in it by the German shells — the enemy lost very heavily, for the three Maxims which had there been mounted did awful execution. The invaders, however, seeing the strong defence, fell back for full twenty minutes, and then, making another rush, hurled petrol bombs into the midst of our men. A frightful holocaust was the result.	The flames leapt up, devouring everything in their path, and the cries of the wounded were heartrending. Despite this, the defenders, though sorely pressed, managed to hold their position. Reinforcements arrived just in time to prevent the barrier from being overrun. These new troops, many of them fresh and determined, surged forward with a fierce cry, driving the invaders back with renewed vigor. As the battle raged, the streets became a chaos of noise, smoke, and confusion. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and burning, the ground littered with debris and the fallen. Yet amidst this turmoil, acts of incredible heroism emerged. One young soldier, seeing a group of his comrades trapped by flames, dashed through the fire with a wet blanket and managed to smother the flames, saving those who were still alive. Elsewhere, a medic, ignoring the danger to herself, moved continuously along the frontline, tending to the wounded under constant fire. Her bravery saved many lives that night, as she dragged the injured to safety and administered first aid under the	1906	1950.0245
Then electricity, long needed, became available through the work of the province, which, for protection against floods, built at Mauer on the Bober, not far above the village, a great storage dam and developed a large horse power, which it offered to consumers for two and a half cents per kilowatt hour for power, and five cents for light. Thirty of the members of the bank wanted it in their houses, and two wanted it for motors on their farms. The dairy also needed power. An electricity co operative society with limited liability was organised by those who wanted the service, with shares at twelve dollars, of which a tenth had to be paid  555 down. The association had to buy wires and lamps and set poles; the province furnished the transformer. Three thousand dollars was necessary, and the bank loaned this at four and a half percent.	The implementation of this plan was met with enthusiasm. By pooling resources and organizing collectively, the villagers not only reduced individual costs but also brought modern conveniences to their community, which previously seemed unattainable. The setup was efficient: the electricity flowed from the dam to the transformer provided by the province, and from there, through the infrastructure set up by the cooperative, it reached homes and businesses. This electrification brought significant changes in daily life and work; households enjoyed the benefits of electric lighting, replacing oil lamps and candles, which were not only less efficient but also posed fire hazards. On the farms, the introduction of electric motors revolutionized agricultural practices. Tasks that once required strenuous physical labor or the use of animals could now be accomplished more quickly and with less effort. The dairy, which was among the primary beneficiaries within the community, utilized the electric power for milking machines and refrigeration, increasing productivity and improving the storage quality of milk and dairy products. The success of the electricity co-operative became a model for other rural areas. It demonstrated how rural communities could leverage modern technology through cooperative	1913	1975.8942
"A mostly silent throng lined the lane leading to the farm. halfway, stood the man who had come down to lecture on ''Rational Marriage, "" surrounded by a group of Martover Socialists. From them rose a few hisses and groans as the Newburys passed. But other groups represented the Church Confraternities and clubs of the Newbury estate. Among them heads were quietly bared as the old man went by, or hands were silently held out. Even a stranger would have realised that the scene represented the meeting of two opposing currents of thought and life. Newbury placed his father in the carriage, which drove off. He then went back himself to wait for the verdict. As he approached the door of the laboratory in which the inquiry had been held, Coryston emerged. Newbury flushed and stopped him. Coryston received it as though it had been the challenge of an enemy."	"""Newbury,"" he said with a cold, hard tone, ""I have nothing to say to you."" But Newbury was persistent. ""Coryston, we must talk. This division, this—this hostility—it benefits no one. Not you, not me, not the community."" Coryston's eyes narrowed slightly. ""And what, pray tell, do you propose? A truce? A compromise? You know as well as I that our ideals cannot be so easily reconciled."" Newbury took a deep breath, his voice filled with a desperate sincerity. ""I know we differ, perhaps more sharply now than ever. But there must be some common ground, some way to coexist, to work together for the good of all."" The air between them was taut, filled with the weight of unspoken histories and unresolved strife. Coryston looked as if he was about to turn away, but something in Newbury's plea held him back. ""Look around you, Coryston,"" Newbury gestured to the crowd, still lingering, still divided. """	1913	1958.7728
"But within us, as human beings, there is something that cries out and rebels against such a blind life. Man is born to ask what things mean. He is possessed with the idea that there is a significance in the world beyond that which meets his senses. John Fiske has brought out this fact: very clearly in his last book, "" Through Nature to God."" He shows that ""in the morning twilight of existence the Human Soul vaguely  reached forth toward something akin to itself, not in the realm of fleeting phenomena, but in the Eternal Presence beyond."" He argues by the analogy of evolution, which always presupposes a real relation between the life and the environment to which it adjusts itself, that this forth reaching and unfolding of the soul implies the everlasting reality of religion. The argument is good."	It suggests that our deepest intuitions and spiritual yearnings are not mere accidents of our psychological makeup, but profound indications of our relation to a broader, metaphysical realm. Indeed, the perpetual quest for meaning and understanding seems embedded in the very fabric of human consciousness, and perhaps serves as a bridge connecting the material to the transcendent. Fiske posits that as evolution advances, so does the complexity of consciousness, leading beings not only to adapt to their environment in a physical sense but to seek understanding and communion with a greater universal truth. This progression hints at an intrinsic spiritual dimension to evolution, where the development of the mind and the cultivation of the soul are as critical to survival as the adaptation of physical traits. This view aligns with the thoughts of many philosophers and theologians who have long contended that there is more to human existence than mere survival and reproduction. The persistent human drive to create art, engage in philosophical inquiry, and establish religious institutions speaks to a fundamental aspect of what it means to be human. Thus, if we accept Fiske’s argument, our spiritual inclinations are	1908	2003.3357
"Incidentally, the high light that the discussion has thrown on the real opinions of some of the political leaders of the state as to the desirability of real democratic government, has rendered the whole matter highly illuminating to the people. Former Mayor Taylor of San Francisco, for instance, a much respected citizen and generally known as a reformer, in opposing the recall as applied to the judiciary, gravely and ingenuously remarked: ""It is the courts alone whose function it is to determine what the law is. The legislative branch has deputed to it the determination of what the law shall be."" How grateful the people ought to be that they are allowed, through legislative departments that they have never been able really to elect or control — how grateful the people ought to be that they are thus allowed — to pass laws that shall be. Note bene, ""shall be."" Note well, it is always shall be."	This statement, though perhaps meant to reassure, inadvertently exposes a deep-seated concern among many citizens—that their influence over the laws which govern them is more theoretical than practical. The idea that once laws are made, they are handed over to an almost sacrosanct judiciary which alone interprets them, might be constitutionally sound but does little to assuage fears of a disconnected ruling class. It underscores a growing sentiment that while democracy promises a government 'of the people, by the people, for the people,' in practice, it often feels like a government 'of the elite, by the elite, for the elite.' The debates surrounding the recall and other mechanisms of direct democracy are symptomatic of a broader desire for more tangible and immediate forms of participation in the political process. Citizens are increasingly skeptical of the layers of delegation that distance them from decision-making power, craving instead a more direct hand in the shaping of their destinies. This is not merely a question of political theory but a profound expression of democratic fatigue, where the electorate yearns not just for representation but for genuine agency. In this	1911	1977.3704
Fig. 88. Various kinds of roots on apple trees, a. Cut too short, b. Stock has died and roots have been sent out from the cion. c. Similar to b, but with more fibrous roots, d. A good form well dug, in which the stock is still preserved. If the sub soil is a very hard clay that the roots can scarcely penetrate, very deep ploughing should be resorted to; but as this is not deep enough to give the roots much of a chance in very hard, dry clays, the holes should be dug very deep. A better way than digging holes into such hardpan is to explode a medium charge of    dynamite in each hole, which will so loosen the soil that the roots can penetrate it.	This method, while seemingly drastic, has been found quite effective in breaking up the hardpan and allowing for deeper root penetration, which is essential for the healthy growth and stability of the tree. The use of dynamite in agricultural settings, particularly for the purpose of soil aeration and breaking up of dense subsoil layers, has been practiced for decades and can be safely managed with proper precautions. Once the hardpan is shattered, the soil becomes more receptive to water and nutrients, which are vital for the growth of the tree. Furthermore, the loosened soil will enable the roots to spread out more freely and establish a strong, widespread network. This is particularly beneficial for young trees, as it aids in their stability and increases their ability to absorb water during periods of drought. After the explosion, it is advisable to amend the soil with organic matter such as compost or aged manure. This will help to improve soil structure, increase its nutrient content, and enhance its water-holding capacity. Thorough mixing of the organic amendments into the loosened soil will ensure that the roots of the apple trees have	1914	1995.8274
But now and then a man appears who chafes at the limits of a single cell, who feels that there should be additional compartments, or that partitions between established divisions should be broken and become nominal merely. He may even insist that the point of view or the method of research of all the specialists requires modification. Such a man may  be so far in advance of his time that he is largely unappreciated by his contemporaries. This has been to some extent the case with Darwin and with Galton. Happily both lived to receive some parts of the tributes they deserved from their fellows.	Yet their initial reception serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by those who dare to disrupt the established order of knowledge. These pioneers, by virtue of their forward thinking, often find themselves isolated in their pursuits, their theories subjected to scrutiny and skepticism. It is the nature of groundbreaking work to be at first misunderstood and even resisted.  The reevaluation of accepted paradigms does not come easily. It involves not only the introduction of new ideas but also the unsettling of the old. For every Darwin or Galton, who ultimately sees their work recognized, there are countless others whose contributions are overlooked during their lifetimes, and perhaps even forever.  Such is the plight of the visionary— to see beyond the horizon and to often walk alone towards it. Their paths are paved with both the excitement of discovery and the burdens of solitude and misunderstanding. Yet, it is these very individuals who push humanity forward, who stretch the boundaries of our understanding and challenge us to think beyond the immediate and apparent. Their legacy is not just in their discoveries, but in the inspiration they provide to future generations to question	1911	1998.09
"Its business during the year amounted to two million dollars, and mounted in eight years to two hundred million. The first year, and every year since, it has paid a dividend to its shareholders. Since then it has never stopped growing, no matter how the market stood or whether the other banks of the city were or were not in trouble. Organised mainly for the business of short time loans, usually three months with one renewal, and discounts at reasonable rates of interest, it has emptied the terra cotta vases, previously the ""piccolo"" savings banks of the populace, and put the money at interest in the people's bank. At the general meeting in March, 1913, the officers of the bank reported a membership of more than twenty-seven thousand, a net increase of five hundred in the year, two thirds of whom hold but a single share."	This remarkable growth was attributed not only to the sound financial management by the bank's officers but also to the increasing trust and confidence placed in the institution by the local community. The bank’s strategy of focusing on accessible, short-term financial solutions resonated particularly well with small business owners and individual savers, who found it a reliable source of liquidity in times of need. The bank also introduced several innovative programs aimed at enhancing financial literacy among its clients, which included workshops and free advisory services. This initiative helped to demystify banking processes and encouraged more people to invest and save with the bank, thus fostering a deeper relationship with the community. Moreover, the bank had begun to expand its services beyond short-term loans and discounts. It started offering mortgage services and personal loans with competitive interest rates, which attracted a broader clientele. Investments in technology also improved service delivery, with the introduction of online banking and mobile banking apps, making transactions more convenient for its users. As a result, the bank not only solidified its position in the local market but also began to attract attention from larger markets, setting the stage for	1913	2001.9996
"Yon Kronhelm probably thought that he would be able to draw off some of his numerous foes to the westward. But the message was received too late. Prince Henry did his best to obey it, but by this time the very existence of the Xllth Corps was at stake on account of the totally unexpected attack on his left rear by the British regular troops. ""He opposed such a stout resistance with the troops under his immediate command that he brought the  British advance to a temporary standstill, while in his rear every road leading Londonward was crowded with the rest of his army as they fell back from West Drayton, Uxbridge, Ruislip, and Pinner."	The engagement was fierce and the artillery fire especially heavy, with shells bursting in air and on the ground, creating a tumultuous roar that echoed through the fields and over the hills. Despite the intensity of the British assault, Prince Henry's strategic withdrawal was executed with remarkable discipline. His regiments, while retreating, maintained a coherent formation, allowing them to fend off the pursuing enemy effectively. The skies were darkened by the smoke of gunfire and the dust raised by the movement of troops and horses. The ground was littered with debris, spent cartridges, and the fallen. Yet, amidst this chaos, the resolve of the XIIth Corps did not waver. They were determined to reach a more defensible position, where they could regroup and possibly counterattack. As the British forces realized the difficulty of breaking the German lines during their retreat, they began to employ more cautious tactics, using cover and advancing in more controlled bursts. The battle thus turned into a series of skirmishes, with both sides exchanging fire but neither gaining a decisive advantage. Meanwhile, Prince Henry was constantly in communication with his	1906	1951.6182
Its leaves are much smaller than those of the American or European chestnuts and the burrs are small with a thin, papery lining and short spines. The nuts are large and glossy, but inferior to the other chestnuts in quality as a rule, though good when cooked. A few varieties are of good quality when fresh. Among the best of the Japanese chestnuts are Parry and Reliance, both of which are of fair quality. Chinquapin (Castanea pumila), (C. alnifoliaj. The Chinqua pins are dwarf chestnuts, extending, in their native range, from Massachusetts south to Florida and Texas. The fruit of the Chinquapins is edible and used in a local way throughout their range. Propagation. The different species of the chestnut are usually propagated from seed, which may be sown as soon as gathered in autumn, or stratified and sown in the spring in rich, porous soil.	Young seedlings require partial shade and must be protected from the wind. They are generally transplanted when they are one or two years old to their permanent positions. The soil should be well-drained, deep, and loamy, as chestnuts do not thrive in heavy, wet soil. In addition to seed propagation, certain varieties of chestnuts can also be propagated by grafting or budding. This is particularly useful for propagating superior cultivars that produce high-quality nuts. Grafting should be done in early spring before the sap starts to flow. The scion wood, which is a short length of last year's growth from a desirable parent tree, is grafted onto a rootstock that has been grown from seed.  Layering is another method that can be used, particularly with the Chinquapins, due to their smaller size and more pliable branches. This involves bending a low-growing branch to the ground, partially burying it, and then securing it in place. Roots will form at the point of contact with the soil, and once these are well established, the	1914	1959.4258
The Oyster shell Bark Louse (Lepidosaphes uli) is about the colour of the bark on which it grows. It is very injurious where it occurs in great numbers. In appearance each scale is long and shaped somewhat like an oyster. Its life history    87  and remedies are much like those for other scales. It generally yields readily to the whitewash treatment, but where many trees are badly infested they should be treated with some of the soluble oils, or lime and sulphur wash should be used. Woolly Apple Louse (Schizoneura lanigeraj; branch form. When fully grown, this insect is dark coloured and covered with a cottony coating. They may be found covering the new bark about wounds and in the axils of leaves and buds and they may cause serious wounds when neglected. It comes from small eggs laid near the base of the twigs. Remedies. They are easily destroyed by painting with kerosene.	For more persistent infestations, a thorough spraying with a diluted solution of nicotine sulphate can be effective. This should be applied early in the spring when the eggs begin to hatch, and possibly a second time a few weeks later to catch any that were missed or have hatched subsequently. It is crucial to ensure that the spray reaches the hidden nooks where these lice tend to congregate and lay their eggs. Additionally, maintaining general tree health through proper pruning, fertilization, and watering can help reduce the incidence of infestations. Weak or stressed trees are more susceptible to pest problems, so keeping trees in good condition can naturally help to keep pests at bay. In cases of severe infestation, it may be necessary to prune out and destroy heavily infested branches to prevent the spread of the lice to healthier parts of the tree. Always clean pruning tools with a solution of bleach or alcohol between cuts to avoid spreading the pests.  Lastly, encouraging natural predators such as ladybugs, lacewing larvae, and certain types of birds can provide long-term control by keeping the louse populations	1914	1997.7202
And again no one teaches the study of nature in the true spirit who does not bring near to the child the ethical meaning of nature's eternal laws which demand submission of the human will and widen and ennoble the human heart. It is an utterly narrow idea to think that the study of nature is only utilitarian, and that its influence on the view of the world must be a materialistic one. Indeed, there is a widespread confusion which suggests that it is materialistic to give our interest to the material things of nature as against the world of ideas which give us idealistic content. The truth is that the study of material things can be a source of idealistic inspiration just as the study of ideal things can easily lead to materialistic views. Everything depends upon the attitude of teacher and pupil.	The true teacher of nature strives to illuminate the interconnectedness of all things, revealing how physical laws mirror moral laws. By observing the rhythm of the seasons, the balance of ecosystems, and the intricate dependencies within habitats, students are guided to see that cooperation, not competition, is the foundational principle of life. This perspective fosters a sense of responsibility and stewardship towards the environment and all living beings.  Moreover, the aesthetic beauty of natural phenomena can stir emotions and awaken a deep appreciation for the wonders of the world, encouraging a reverence for life that transcends mere utilitarian values. This aesthetic appreciation, when coupled with scientific understanding, elevates the soul and broadens the intellect, merging the poetic with the practical. Thus, the study of nature, when approached in a spirit of inquiry and respect, becomes a holistic education that nurtures both the mind and the heart. It teaches humility before the vastness of nature, cultivates an ethic of care for the planet, and inspires a lifelong quest for knowledge and wisdom. In this way, nature study becomes a profound philosophical journey, one that enrich	1909	2004.7518
"""What are the other human events which you find yourself indifferent to?"" We thought a moment. ""Well, defalcations, with or without abscondence, do not move us in the old way. Accidents, large or small, no longer have their former allure; we rather shun them than otherwise. They have a monotony: the sinking of ships, the blowing up of steam or dynamite or the caving in of mines; or the collapse of buildings; or the panic crush in burning theatres; or the conflagration of cities; or the explosion of powder mills; or falls from lofty scaffoldings; or fatal capsizings in rowboats; or death wounds from unloaded guns; or Fourth of July celebrations: the list is long, but not so much varied from year to year as to pique curiosity. The aeroplane has now come in to add its mortal precipitations from air pockets, and its deadly mischances from breaks of every sort in its mechanism; but its casualties have scarcely more claim upon our curiosity than the calamities of the automobile which daily kills and maims those in it and in its way without winning the eye to the sanguinary record in the morning paper."	It seems that the more frequent and common these disasters become, the more they merge into the dull background of everyday occurrences, losing that sharp sting of novelty that once caught and held our attention. Indeed, it may be that our senses, overwhelmed by the constancy of such spectacles, have grown numb, unable to discern in these repeated tragedies anything but the monotonous tick of the clock of fate. This desensitization might well be considered a merciful provision by nature, sparing us from being perpetually harrowed by the misfortunes that befall our fellow beings. Yet, there lies a danger too, in this growing indifference; for without the spur of emotional engagement, the impetus to prevent such miseries may weaken, leaving us all the more vulnerable to the whims of chance and error. Thus, while we may no longer stand riveted by horror at each fresh report of disaster, we must guard against the lethargy that such detachment breeds, lest our inaction invite even greater calamities.	1913	1893.725

Fig. 5 shows a strip cut from the photograph taken by the light of the inverted arc lamp placed adjacent to a strip from that taken by daylight, as shown in Fig.	4. The comparison clearly demonstrates the consistency and accuracy with which the inverted arc lamp mimics natural daylight conditions, making it an invaluable tool for artists and photographers who require precise color representation in their workspaces irrespective of the time of day. The next part of the experiment involved a detailed analysis of how these tone values translate when subjected to different lighting conditions beyond the controlled settings of north light and inverted arc lamp illumination. This was conducted to further validate the versatility and reliability of the arc lamp in simulating daylight across varied environments. To do this, several strips from the same photograph were exposed under tungsten, fluorescent, and LED lighting sources. Each lighting condition was carefully measured and the resultant color shifts were documented. The strips were then compared side-by-side to assess deviations from the original daylight and arc lamp renditions. The findings were quite enlightening. Under tungsten lighting, there was a noticeable warm shift, particularly in the yellows and reds, making them appear more vibrant but less accurate. Fluorescent lighting introduced a cooler cast, slightly muting the reds and enhancing the blues and greens	1912	2005.2642
"If the employee has been guilty of tortious or negligent acts, it seems that may warrant a subsequent discharge.‘ Retention of service and payment of wages without protest, after knowledge of defective work done by an employee, is prima facie evidence of a waiver of the right to discharge him, or deduct from his wages on that account.’ It seems that the keeping of an employee whose skill and work was not equal to that contracted for until the busy season was over, it being very diﬂicult to secure a. competent substitute, is not of itself a condonation. What amounts to a condonation of a servant’s offence is a question for a jury The keeping of an employee after his work has become unsatisfactory is not a coudonation of the acts causing dissatisfaction, when the contract provides that the employee may be discharged whenever his work proves unsatisfactory.’ A person cannot, by a decree of court, be compelled to retain another in his service."" 208. What Is a Discharge. — What amounts to a discharge of an employee is not always clear. It has been held that a request or demand for the employee’s resignation amounts to a discharge.“ A letter to a railroad ' Leatherberry v. Odell, 7 Fed. Rep. "" Tickler 1). Andrae Mfg. 00.

Law, 506; and similar rulings have been observed in other jurisdictions, indicating a broad interpretation of what constitutes a discharge. Moreover, the act of significantly reducing an employee's work hours or drastically changing their role without their consent may also be interpreted as a constructive discharge. This is particularly so if such changes make the employee's working conditions intolerable, effectively forcing them to resign. In cases where an employer has made the work environment so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign, the courts have often held that this too constitutes a discharge. This concept, known as constructive dismissal, treats the resignation as if the employer had formally terminated the employment, thereby entitling the employee to various benefits and protections under employment law, including potentially wrongful dismissal damages. Furthermore, the cessation of work assignments, exclusion from meetings or critical communications, or the sudden and unexplained removal of responsibilities can also signal a de facto discharge, even if the employer has not formally declared such an action. Each of these scenarios can be seen as an employer's attempt to sidest	1913	1994.003
"She has still left Arthur the estates for life, but with remainder to Coryston's son, should'he have one, and she has made Coryston a trustee, together with Sir Wilfrid Bury. This will mean practically a division between the brothers — to which Arthur has already pledged himself, so he tells me — but with no power to Coryston to make such radical changes as would destroy the family tradition, at least without Arthur's consent and Sir Wilfrid's. But Coryston will have plenty of money and plenty of land wherewith to experiment, and no doubt we shall see some strange things. ""Thus she kept her flag flying to the end, so far as the enfeebled brain allowed. Yet the fact is that her state of dependence on her children during her illness, and their goodness to her, did in truth evoke another woman, with new perceptions, superposed, as it were, upon the old."	It is curious to observe how the character, so rigid and unyielding in health, mellowed under the influence of physical weakness and the tender ministrations of those she had once commanded with such autocratic sway. There was a softening, a humanizing effect, that none who knew the old Marcia could have anticipated. This new Marcia, emergent in the twilight of her life, seemed to grasp at last the finer threads of human relationship which her imperious nature had previously ignored or undervalued. Her final dispositions, as expressed in the will, reflected this transformation. By ensuring that Coryston could pursue his more progressive ideas without entirely severing the continuity of the family's traditional stewardship, she showed a nuanced understanding of both preservation and progress. This balancing act between the old guards and the new was a testament to her late-blooming wisdom. It was as if she sought to reconcile the divergent paths her sons had taken, binding them to a common legacy yet allowing each the freedom to express his distinct values and beliefs.

There are, however, a few factors that add a note of caution to land operations in a manner similar to sea operations. Fog, whose boundaries are outlined and whose drift is known is a simple problem but, as over the ocean, fog areas may grow due to a shift of wind or arrival of parcels of greater moisture content. To assure the safety of any flight near or over an advection fog area, sufficient fuel must be on board to enable the captain to proceed to an alternate airport which cannot be endangered by a rapid expansion of the fog area. Another situation wherein cautionary measures must be taken is one in which the fog is developing but is not sufficiently thick to restrict visibility seriously. Very suddenly, a light fog can intensify and spread extensively. Aircraft operating over areas subject to advection fog development while the flight is in progress should and must carry additional fuel to reach a landing place well beyond the area of potential fog. Extra gasoline in questionable cases is very good insurance.	Similarly, sudden storms or squalls present another challenge to land operations, much like they do at sea. These meteorological phenomena can escalate quickly, transforming conditions from clear skies to severe turbulence and reduced visibility within minutes. Pilots must always be prepared for such eventualities by having updated weather information and alternate flight plans readily accessible.  In addition to weather-related factors, land operations must also consider the terrain over which they are flying. Mountainous areas, for example, not only pose physical barriers but also create unpredictable wind patterns that can jeopardize flight safety. Pilots navigating these regions often require specialized training to handle potential updrafts, downdrafts, and turbulence caused by the uneven topography. Furthermore, wildlife activity, such as bird migrations, can significantly impact flight safety. Bird strikes during takeoff, landing, or at lower altitudes can cause critical damage to aircraft. Airports and flight operators often employ various wildlife management strategies to mitigate these risks, but pilots must remain vigilant, especially during peak migration periods. All these factors underscore the importance of thorough pre-flight planning and the need for	1913	2006.3893
"Such a contract must be distinguished from a promise to marry and the promisor afterward taking advantage of the trust and conﬁdence imposed in him The defence of public policy proceeds not upon the idea of relief to the defendant, but protection to the public, and it is immaterial that a defendant was ignorant of the illegality.lo It is not therefore necessary to plead public policy to prevent a recovery on a contract invalid as against public policy.“ 19 Amer, & Eng.

In these cases, the courts have consistently held that contracts or agreements that contravene public policy are void ab initio, meaning they are treated as invalid from the outset, regardless of the intentions or understandings of the parties involved. Furthermore, the rationale behind the doctrine of public policy is to uphold the interests of the community and the state over the private interests of individuals. This ensures that no contract or agreement can legally exist if it undermines societal values or the legal framework itself. For instance, agreements promoting illegal activities or those that are inherently unfair or oppressive to one party are typically prohibited, as they are adverse to the principles of fairness and justice that underpin the legal system. In light of these precedents and principles, it is evident that the courts play a crucial role in interpreting and enforcing the bounds of public policy. They must balance the rights and duties of the parties involved while ensuring that no agreement or contract undermines societal values or the rule	1913	1990.6969
"Certain courts may and do allow persons for whose beneﬁt the promise 18 made, i. e., the beneficiaries, to sue on a contract; but, as Professor Langdell has said in his Summary, the consequence is that the promisor is then 118-ble to two actions — — oneby the promisee and one by the beneficiary. In truths promise to A to pay one hundred dollars to B confers no right “P011 B m law or equity, but there are similar cases in which B has been allowed to recover against the promisor.“ Therefore a third party was held not liable for the work of a contractolié because he told him, while the work was in progress, to go 0“ am] do the “Or ordered by the owner and he would Pay for it; nor for the reason that tbs owner introduced the third party to the contractor as his paI‘tn e1‘ an coadjutor in the Work, and that he was shown what was bemg done In con‘ nection with the Owner, and that he expressed great satisfaction and told the contractor to go on and do all that the Owner ordered and he W(: I-11d pay for it.

As such, the third party did not become a party to the contract nor assume any legal obligation to pay for the work performed under the contract. The essence of a binding contract is the intention of the parties to enter into a legal obligation, which must be supported by consideration. Without the presence of consideration, any promise made is generally not enforceable. In this scenario, the third party's expression of satisfaction and encouragement to continue work does not constitute legally sufficient consideration, as there was no exchange of value or detriment incurred by the third party based on the promise made. Furthermore, the principle of privity of contract stipulates that only those who are parties to the contract have the right to sue or be sued on the contract. This principle reinforces the idea that the third party, not having been a party to the original agreement nor having provided any consideration, remains outside the contractual obligations and rights. This principle protects individuals from unforeseen liability arising from contracts to which they did not consent. In summary, the legal framework surrounding contracts generally requires the presence of an agreement, consideration, and mutual intent to be legally	1913	1921.9008

The courts have consistently underscored the importance of maintaining a competitive bidding environment to the extent possible. This ensures that the government does not unfairly pay a premium for patented items when equivalent non-patented items are available, and also that the patent holder does not misuse their patent to stifle competition unfairly. In instances where the patented item has no close non-patented equivalents, or where the patented item significantly outperforms available alternatives, the courts have allowed for specifications that favor the patented item. However, these cases always require a clear demonstration of the necessity for such specifications based on quality, efficiency, or other functional metrics that justify the lack of competition.  Moreover, when the specifications allow for an alternative, as seen in the case involving the lathing, the alternative must be of ""equal quality.""

"Confessing our ignorance, we pass on to Mrs. Garrick and her quarante cinq faqona de southeast coiffer. Let not the uninitiated male reader mistake. There is no question here of drawing a parting, of brushing to right or to left; not even of simple curling, frizzing, or waving. The J'aqons treated of are much more complicated and reach the level of high art. For in 1766 ladies had begun to array their hair in the most elaborate style ever known. """	The towering structures that adorned their heads were not merely coiffures; they were edifices of art, constructions of intricate design that required hours of painstaking labor to perfect. Hair was teased and piled high upon the crown, intertwined with ribbons, festooned with flowers, and sometimes even adorned with model ships or birdcages. Powdered to perfection, these hairstyles became symbols of status and fashion, reflecting the elaborate tastes of the time. Mrs. Garrick, with her forty-five ways of arranging one's hair, was a master of this ornate craft. Each style she proposed was more extravagant than the last, incorporating various accessories and techniques to achieve heights and volumes that were nothing short of architectural. Her methods were detailed in pamphlets that circulated among the elite, becoming the go-to guide for ladies wishing to make a statement at every ball and soirée.

The second the clear plan which William had evidently made for the decisive fighting in the southeast. The first may be briefly told. Harold could hardly have heard of the landing until Monday. He managed to be in London (not, of course, with his whole host, but in person) upon the Friday, or at the latest upon the Saturday. That was good riding. Allow the longest limit and it means four full days and part of two others in which to cover 200 miles. But excellent as the feat was, what follows   is perhaps more remarkable.	For having arrived in London, Harold did not pause to rest or gather further reinforcements, which many a commander might have considered essential. Instead, he pressed on with an urgency that was almost reckless. By the next week, he had moved his forces rapidly southward, reaching the vicinity of Hastings just five days after arriving in London. This rapid movement, though bold, was necessary. Harold was well aware that William's forces were not just formidable but also well-prepared and strategically positioned. The advantage would lie with the one who could strike decisively and swiftly. Harold's strategy was clear: he aimed to catch William off-guard, before the Norman forces could fully entrench or receive additional reinforcements from the continent. The English king knew the terrain well and used this knowledge to maneuver his army quickly through familiar territory. His men, though weary from such rapid movement, were driven by a fierce loyalty and the urgency of defending their homeland. This urgency was perhaps fueled by Harold's understanding of the broader implications of William's invasion. It was not merely a battle for the throne, but for the future of	1912	1971.5458
17 are shown the lift, lift/drift, and centre of pressure plotted in the usual way, while upon the same sheets are shown the lift and lift/drift calculated on assumption No. 1 from the lift and drift curves of RAF. 6. In addition to these curves are shown the lift, the lift/drift, and the centre of pressure curves for RAF. 6 itself. In Fig. 18 are shown the rolling and yawing moments and the corresponding calculated curves The lateral force was found to be so small as to be negligible, being certainly less than i percent, of the lift at 4° angle of incidence, or about equivalent to 7 lbs. upon a full sized machine.	This negligible lateral force indicates that the aerodynamic design of the wing is highly efficient in maintaining stability, which is crucial for maintaining the intended flight path without unnecessary corrections. Figure 19 further explores the stability characteristics by presenting the pitch damping and the directional stability curves, both of which are essential for understanding how the aircraft will behave in response to perturbations in its flight attitude. These curves are crucial for pilots and engineers alike, as they provide insights into the inherent stability of the aircraft and its response to control inputs under various flight conditions. For instance, a positive slope in the pitch damping curve indicates that the aircraft will naturally return to its original pitch angle after being disturbed, a characteristic known as positive static stability. Similarly, a positive value in the directional stability curve suggests that the aircraft will naturally align with the wind direction when subjected to a yaw disturbance, which is indicative of positive directional stability. Such data are not only fundamental in the design and testing phases but also play a significant role during certification processes where adherence to safety and performance standards must be rigorously demonstrated. Moreover, understanding these characteristics allows for the	1912	2004.4161

The Rural New Yorker, New York, N. Y. The various local farm papers usually maintain horticultural columns or publish more or less matter relating to fruit growing. The reports of the state horticultural societies contain many valuable suggestions, and as they are based very largely on the actual experience of local growers, they are usually very practical and useful. BULLETINS. The U. S. Department of Agriculture has published a number of bulletins on fruit growing which may be obtained free of charge by writing to the Division of Publications, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. The bulletins which are now available include the following:  Farmers' Bulletin 113, The Apple and How to Grow It.	Farmers' Bulletin 154, Pruning Fruit Trees. Farmers' Bulletin 181, Orchard Management. Farmers' Bulletin 198, Diseases of Fruits and How to Control Them. Farmers' Bulletin 208, The Culture of Peaches and Nectarines. Farmers' Bulletin 237, Strawberry Growing. Each of these bulletins is designed to provide practical, scientifically sound advice tailored to the needs of the American farmer and fruit grower. They cover a range of topics from the basics of planting and care to more advanced techniques in pest management and disease control. Additionally, many state universities with agricultural programs also produce their own series of guides and bulletins, which often include region-specific information that can be invaluable for local growers. These resources frequently address the particular challenges and opportunities presented by local climates and soil types. For those involved in the commercial fruit trade, staying informed through these publications can lead to improved crop yields and better market results. The combination of traditional farming wisdom and modern agricultural science found in these bulletins provides a robust foundation for any serious grower looking to optimize their	1914	2002.9192
to the Pembrokeshire coast — they had indeed landed. De Montfort issued writs all over the country, accusing Edward of rebellion and treason, and summoned by the Royal writ feudal levies from all over the kingdom to the Severn Valley. By an accident which has never been explained in so great a commander, but probably because he did not know what forces he had in front of him and wanted to gather all the regular bodies he could before fighting a decisive action, De Montfort remained in that distant western post of Hereford apparently inactive. He secured himself for the coming struggle by a treaty with the Welsh chiefs, which virtually de stroyed the claim of the English Crown over them. He even engaged not a small force of Welshmen to join his command, and at last, but very late, after more than a month's delay he moved.	It was a slow and cautious advance, marked by the strategic prudence for which De Montfort was renowned. As he marched, the terrain and the local allegiances dictated his path. His alliance with the Welsh chiefs not only bolstered his forces but also provided him critical insights into the local geography and potential ambush points, which were invaluable against Edward’s troops. His forces swelled as local dissenters, drawn by his charisma and promise of reform, joined ranks with the seasoned Welsh fighters. The landscape was dotted with castles, each a potential stronghold for Edward’s loyalists, and De Montfort knew the importance of either winning these to his cause or neutralizing them. His approach was thus methodical, securing key positions as he went, ensuring that no enemy could attack from the rear. This strategy, however, cost him time — a luxury he scarcely could afford as Edward’s forces gathered strength. In the meantime, Edward was not idle. His agents spread rumors and dissent in the ranks of De Montfort’s allies, attempting to sow discord and weaken the coalition before the actual clash of arms	1912	1938.276

This separation has allowed for a more stable and efficient operation of public services, as technical and administrative decisions are made based on expertise and long-term planning rather than shifting political winds. The Swiss model has been lauded for its ability to maintain high standards of service while also ensuring that the infrastructure is continuously updated and well-maintained. In addition to railways and distilleries, Switzerland has also seen significant state involvement in other sectors such as water supply, electricity, and postal services. This comprehensive approach has not only streamlined operations but has also helped in keeping the costs for these services relatively low for the end consumers. Furthermore, the profits generated from these enterprises are reinvested into public infrastructure, healthcare, and education, thereby benefiting the broader society. The emphasis on non-politicization of the civil service is another cornerstone of this model. By recruiting and promoting civil servants based on merit and expertise, and ensuring their job security across political cycles, Switzerland has cultivated a skilled and dedicated workforce. This workforce is focused on the efficient and impartial delivery of services, irrespective of any political changes, thereby ensuring continuity and	1911	1994.8318

Octavo, cloth, 6s. net. In this provocative exploration, Charles Tibbiti delves into the complexities of matrimonial bonds, examining the forces that both forge and dissolve them. With a keen sociological eye, Tibbiti discusses the changing dynamics in modern relationships, influenced by cultural shifts, personal expectations, and the often overlooked impact of individual growth on marital stability. The book is rich with case studies and personal anecdotes, making it accessible yet profound, appealing to both the casual reader and the serious student of social dynamics. Using a narrative style that is both engaging and insightful, Tibbiti challenges the romantic ideal of marriage, proposing instead a more pragmatic approach to understanding it as a dynamic and evolving relationship rather than a static institution. His discussions on the causes of marital disintegration, from lack of communication and financial disagreements to infidelity and personal change, are particularly illuminating. ""Wedded but Wandering"" is not just a critique but also offers solutions and advice for those seeking to strengthen their marital relationships, making it a valuable resource for"	1912	2007.6044
Jefferson's regard for the common people made him abhor war and advocate peace, but he was ahead of the times in this respect, and Pitt and Napoleon in the end out generaled him. Jefferson was without doubt a great democrat, but his administration as a whole tended rather to strengthen the power of the central government than to establish safeguards for individual liberty. The same conclusion might also be reached in regard to the administrations of those other great leaders of the common people, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln. Personally, both Jackson and Lincoln will ever be an inspiration to the common people, but the great constructive result of Lincoln's administration was the strengthening of the Federal Union. The practical common-sense of our statesmen and our proverbial prosperity have kept us from overmuch theorising and experimenting; and it is no doubt conducive to the permanence of our political institutions that this has been so. The populace in the early days of the country was not so well fitted for the exercise of an unrestricted manhood suffrage as it is today.	However, as education spread and the general level of intelligence rose, the capabilities of the populace to engage in civic duties also enhanced. The founding fathers, with their foresight, perhaps understood that the evolution of a nation’s democracy must parallel its social and educational development. Thus, while the initial restrictive measures might seem contrary to the principles of a broad democracy, they were arguably necessary steps to ensure the stability and gradual maturation of governmental structures. The progress from these early cautious steps to a more inclusive democracy was slow but steady, marked by significant milestones such as the extension of voting rights, the abolition of property requirements, and the eventual recognition of civil rights for all citizens, irrespective of race or gender. Each of these steps, while initiated by leadership, was largely driven by the growing awareness and activism of the common people, proving Jefferson’s belief in the capabilities of the general populace. Indeed, the shift towards a more participatory democracy was not without its challenges and controversies. Each expansion of the franchise was met with resistance and fears of demagoguery or populism that might disrupt the established order.	1911	1970.5536
The best fertiliser is well rotted barnyard manure. Raspberries, especially the black cap kinds, will produce very well even on quite poor soil, but rich land and thorough cultivation is necessary for the best success with any variety. Time of planting. The suckering kinds may be planted in autumn or spring with safety. When the work is done in the autumn great care should be taken to firm the soil around the roots, and a forkful of mulch over each hill is a great protection against winter injury. Many growers prefer to Set in autumn, since at that season they can give the work more careful attention than in the spring. Then, again, the new sprouts from sets (suckers) start very early, and if the work is delayed in the spring the new growth is often broken off or injured in the work of planting.	For the non-suckering varieties, which are primarily propagated through root cuttings or tips, spring planting is usually more advantageous. This allows the plants to establish themselves without the immediate stress of winter. The soil should be prepared to a good depth, incorporating plenty of organic matter and ensuring it is well-drained yet retains moisture.  In regions where winters are severe, mulching after planting in the spring helps to conserve moisture and suppress weeds, while also keeping the soil temperature stable. Raspberries prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH, ideally between 5.5 and 6.5. Testing soil pH and adjusting it if necessary should be part of the preparation process. Planting should be done on a cloudy day or during late afternoon to reduce transplant shock. The roots should be spread out in a trench and covered with soil, which is then firmly pressed down. Watering immediately after planting is crucial to settle the soil around the roots and eliminate air pockets.  Regular watering, especially during the fruiting period and in dry weather, is essential for the health of the plants and the	1914	2004.0222
"We Martians have no fear or dread of death, such as I have heard you say is so prevalent in your world even amongst religious people. With us death, in the ordinary way, is merely like going to sleep ; and it is only the portal through which we pass to 202  another life on another planet. Why, then, should we dread it ? It is simply a removal to another dwelling place !"" "" I quite agree with that view, Merna, "" said John ; "" and our religion teaches us a somewhat similar idea; yet few of its professors look forward with anything but dread to the time when they must pass from their present life."" ""Yes, John, "" said Merna."	"""it appears that despite the teachings, the fear of the unknown still holds a mighty sway over the hearts of your people. Here on Mars, we are educated from a young age to understand and accept the transition as a natural and inevitable part of our existence. We celebrate it as an onward journey—a progression rather than an end. This perspective deeply ingrains in us a sense of peace regarding our eventual departure."" John nodded thoughtfully, absorbing Merna's words. ""It's fascinating,"" he mused. ""In our world, so many live in fear of death, perhaps because they are uncertain of what follows. Your assurance in continuity seems to offer great comfort."" ""Indeed,"" Merna replied, ""our certainty is supported by our experiences and teachings.

It is from that time that we may date the occasional appeal from England's authority to the world outside. Previous to the Reformation, though an appeal to Rome was open to the Irish, it was open to the English as well, and the English of the Pale on one occasion unsuccessfully appealed to the Pope to proclaim a crusade against the native Irishry who were described as worse than the Saracens. But after the Reformation, the English had no place in the Catholic Church; and the Catholic religion was endeared all the more to the Irish because it had to be loved in suffering and sacrifice. Whether this adherence to Catholicism was ultimately beneficial to the Irish, is another question.	The English Reformation severed the religious unity that had somewhat ambiguously bridged the two islands, leaving Ireland isolated in its adherence to Catholicism. This isolation fostered a distinct Irish identity that was both religious and nationalistic, deepening the divide with Protestant England. As the years passed, this religious distinction became a cornerstone of Irish resistance against English domination, influencing rebellions and shaping the political landscape of Ireland. The penal laws implemented by the English government, which aimed to suppress Catholic worship and reduce Catholics to second-class citizens, only intensified the Irish commitment to their faith. The laws not only prohibited Catholic education and the celebration of Mass but also restricted Catholics’ rights to own land, enter professions, and participate in government. This legal discrimination entrenched the association of Catholicism with Irish nationalism, as the struggle for religious freedom merged with the fight for political autonomy. However, the entanglement of religion with national identity had complex consequences. On one hand, it provided a unifying force that helped to sustain the Irish community through periods of severe persecution and hardship. On the other hand, it contributed to a	1908	1997.6681
However unlikely or impossible it may appear that the contract will not be performed, if it be possible to perform it (not terminate it), it is not within the statute. When the performance within a year is impossible it must be in writing or there must be a written memorandum.’ Agreements to do an act more than a year hence; to continue to do an act or service or to refrain from doing it for a greater period than one year; to take a lease for more than one year or for a year, the same to begin at some future day; to serve or employ for more than a year or for a year, the service to begin at some later day; and all contracts in which it is evident that they cannot be performed according to the express intent of the parties within a year, are within the statute. An oral agreement to make annual payments in a contract which by its terms is to continue sixteen years is within the statute, and cannot be enforced; ’ but it might be otherwise if the contract were completely performed by the debtor The following instances will serve to show what agreements are not within the statute, and, if not subject to the restriction of other sections of the statute, need not be in writing : A verbal contract to construct a road or house within a year and twenty days from the date thereof was held valid, as it might be completedwithin the year The same has been held of an agreement dated June 5, 1883, for the erection of a structure to be put up I8 Amer. & Eng. Ency.	of Law, p. 1172, before June 5, 1884. Similarly, a verbal agreement for the sale of goods to be delivered and paid for within a year from the making of the contract has been upheld as falling outside the statute. In these cases, the potential for the contract to be completed within a year renders it enforceable despite its oral nature. Another example of agreements not needing written confirmation as per the statute is a promise to perform personal services within a year, even if the services extend slightly beyond the year, provided the commencement is within the year of the agreement. Such agreements are construed as being capable of completion within a year and hence do not necessitate a written memorial. Contracts involving the transfer of personal property, where the transfer is to be made immediately and payment completed within a year, also do not fall under the statute's requirement for written form. This includes instances where partial deliveries are to be made periodically within the year, as long as the full execution of the contract (including all payments and deliveries) is possible within that timeframe.

60. In Fig. 2 the pressure at each point at a particular angle of incidence is plotted as an ordinate against the projection of the point of observation upon the chord of the aerofoil, whilst in Fig. 3 the same pressures are plotted against the projections of the same points upon a normal to the chord, bnt in the latter figures the scale of length is ten times that in the former figures. Each of the small diagrams of these figures shows the pressure distribution, plotted as described above, over one section, at some particular angle of incidence. The diagrams are so arranged that the distributions on one section at different angles of incidence lie in horizontal rows of eight diagrams each, whilst the distributions over different sections at a particular angle of incidence lie in vertical columns of five diagrams each.	61. This method of presentation allows for a comprehensive analysis of the aerodynamic characteristics across various sections and angles of incidence. It's particularly useful for visualizing how pressure gradients shift and evolve as the aerofoil interacts with the airstream. By examining these shifts, engineers and designers can better understand the lift, drag, and overall aerodynamic efficiency of the aerofoil under different flight conditions. 62. For example, a consistent trend observed across the diagrams may indicate a stable aerodynamic behavior, while anomalies might suggest areas of potential instability or inefficiency. Typically, higher pressures at the leading edge and lower pressures towards the trailing edge indicate effective lift generation. However, abrupt changes or spikes in the pressure distribution can signify separation of the flow, leading to increased drag and potential stalling. 63. The increased scale in Fig. 3 enhances the resolution and detail of the pressure data, making subtle changes more discernible. This is crucial when assessing the boundary layer behavior and the onset of flow separation. The data plotted against the normal to the chord gives a clearer picture of the cross-sectional flow dynamics,	1912	2005.6261

He shook hands with the Dol livers, nodded to Manning, and rejoined his friends, with whom, a few minutes later, they saw him swinging across the field. It was perhaps a quarter of an hour after this that Manning looked at his watch, uttered an exclamation, and said to his wife: "" By Jove, we've no time to lose, rny dear! We'Re likely to be late as it is. I'Ll go ahead and order the car, and — perhaps Mr. Dolliver will bring you down ?"" ""Gladly, "" said Page.

"The desire to put the verb or other predicate forward has given rise to English turns like "" There comes a stranger"" or, in German, with wider reach, ""Es klingelt die Glocke, "" ""Ea sperren die Eiesen den einsamen Weg."" Our American newspaper headlines are particularly given to this sort of striving for emphasis. I have seen examples of it occasionally in such carefully edited papers as The Evening Post or The Courier Journal. It runs riot in the text as well as the headlines of our local daily."	Such constructs, though perhaps jarring to the traditional ear, provide a punchy immediacy that seems to capture the rapid pace and fragmentary nature of modern life. This stylistic choice reflects a broader shift towards a more dynamic, if not abrupt, method of communication often seen in the bustling world of news. In literary terms, this inversion places the focus squarely on the action or the subject at the beginning of the sentence, lending a sense of immediacy and importance to the proceeding information. This technique, while controversial among purists who advocate for a more classical structuring of sentences, undeniably caters to the fast-paced consumption habits of contemporary readers, who often skim texts in search of quick information. As language continues to evolve with the society that uses it, such transformations in style and syntax are both inevitable and indicative of broader cultural shifts.	1911	2007.662
In the notation of this report we have Pitching moment = m Mpp (86) and finally M.P. = 3*7 (87) 1 v 40 X 0 448 v' Normal force due to rolling. — For this position of the aerofoil in normal flight the normal force coefficient is equal to though lift coefficient. The values extracted in (84) show that the lift coefficient does not change with warping. Hence Zp = 0 (88) Longitudinal force due to rolling. — In the ordinary flight position the longitudinal force coefficient is equal to the drift coefficient. From Tables 3 and 8, Report No. 72, we then find Drift coefficient, unwarped aerofoil = 0-0252 ) , flq.	Drift coefficient, warped aerofoil = 0-0267 (89) The slight increase in the drift coefficient when the aerofoil is warped indicates a small but measurable effect on the longitudinal force due to rolling. This is an important consideration for understanding the stability and control of the aircraft during maneuvers involving roll. Lateral force due to rolling. — The lateral force coefficient, which is typically negligible in straight, level flight, becomes significant when the aerofoil is subjected to rolling motions. From the experimental data, we find: Lateral force coefficient, unwarped aerofoil = 0.0000 Lateral force coefficient, warped aerofoil = 0.0024 (90) This increase in lateral force coefficient with aerofoil warping during roll demonstrates the aerofoil's response to asymmetric aerodynamic loading, which is crucial for the pilot's control of the aircraft during such maneuvers. Summarizing, the introduction of warping in the aerofoil leads to changes in the drift and lateral force coefficients, which are essential for predicting the aircraft's behavior	1912	1993.422
"Drunkenness ruins more homes and wrecks more lives than war. How shall we oppose it? I do not say that we shall not pass resolutions and make laws against it. But I do say that we can never really conquer the evil in this way. I hold with Phillips Brooks that ""all prohibitory measures are negative. That they have their uses no one can doubt. That they have their limits is just as clear."""	The true battleground is the human heart and the public conscience. We must educate, we must persuade, we must elevate. It is by the slow but sure process of moral suasion, by the steady uplift of educational forces, and by the persistent illumination of the intellect that we can hope to make progress against the scourge of intemperance. It is a work for the pulpit, the schoolroom, and the press. It is a work for the home, for social organizations, and for individual example. We must replace the allurements of the tavern with healthier, more engaging community activities that bring people together without the need for alcohol. Libraries, sports clubs, arts and crafts centers, and other community-focused groups provide wholesome alternatives that can help to fill the social void that leads many to the barroom. Furthermore, recognizing and addressing the underlying issues that contribute to alcohol abuse—such as poverty, unemployment, and mental health disorders—can reduce the inclination towards drinking. Ultimately, the goal is to foster a society where the temptations of alcohol are less appealing because individuals find greater satisfaction in	1908	1913.7181
As a further illustration of this, Fig. 9 shows another boot shop in the Grand Parade, Harringay — that of Messrs. Freeman, Hardy & Willis — where the window lighting is entirely done by four 000 candle power high pressure lamps. The illumination on the surface of the window varied from 100 foot candles at the top to 4-5 at the bottom. Fig. 10 shows quite another class of trade, namely, a butcher's shop, Messrs.  147 Woodward, at HighVRoad, Wood Green. This is an open fronted shop, as is usual with butchers, and the lighting is done by three 600 candle power high pressure lamps, with parabolic shades on the outside, and with one COO candle power high pressure inverted lamp with concave shade, and two inverted low pressure burners with opal shades on the inside.	The contrast in the lighting between the two shops is notable. In the butcher's shop, the use of external high-pressure lamps with focused beams ensures that the meats are highlighted effectively, drawing the eye of the passerby directly to the fresh, red hues of the cuts on display. This method not only enhances the visual appeal of the products but also serves to maintain a certain level of hygiene by reducing the number of insects attracted to the light. The internal lighting, softer and more diffused due to the opal shades, provides a welcoming glow that invites customers inside, creating an atmosphere that is both clean and professional. In contrast, the boot shop utilizes a more uniform lighting approach, with strong illumination throughout the display window. This ensures that each product, from the highest shelf to the lowest, is presented in clear detail, allowing for the textures and quality of the leather to be appreciated from outside the store. The strategic placement of high candle power lamps ensures that no shadow is cast, and each pair of boots or shoes is showcased to its best advantage. Both lighting strategies, though different in their application and	1912	2000.5414
"He may be wrong, but he cannot be proved to be wrong; and a Sociology which simply sets him aside is no longer a science, it is a creed. This point need not be laboured, partly because it is obvious, partly because pessimism does not practically interest most western men. But, even if we neglect the pessimist, what may be called ""survival ethics "" does not really take us far. Mr. Leslie Stephen, for 1. ""The Science of Ethics."" by Leslie Stephen. 2nd Kdition. Smith Elder and Co.  example, attempts to show that the qualities which we in the West call virtues are identical with those which make for survival. But are they? That they are not incompatible with survival is sufficiently obvious, since, for good or evil, those who do possess them have survived. But the Indians, and in particular the Bengalees, have survived too, and show no intention of disappearing."	Indeed, their survival has been marked by a cultivation of traits that Western ethics might sometimes question—traits such as extreme passivity, a high tolerance for ambiguity, and an intricate social stratification that contradicts many Western ideals of equality and justice. Similarly, one might look at the Spartans, whose society was oriented almost entirely around war and survival through martial prowess. Their virtues—obedience, endurance, military skill—were undeniably effective for survival in their context, but are hardly comprehensive in defining moral goodness by modern standards. Thus, the correlation between survival and virtue proposed by survival ethics appears overly simplistic. It fails to account for the diversity of successful survival strategies that different cultures have employed, strategies that often promote values starkly different from those celebrated in Western societies. Moreover, it does not address the ethical dimensions of these strategies—whether they promote a life that is not only sustainable but also flourishing and just according to broader ethical considerations. The challenge, then, for any ethical system that aligns itself too closely with survival as its primary criterion is that it risks endorsing a might-makes	1908	2006.8073

In the spring it should be uncovered and only one shoot permitted to grow from each joint. After the new growth has started about six inches from each bud, the wnole cane should be layered about four inches  deep, handling it carefully so as not to break the new growth. Fig. 10G shows such a layer after it has rooted. It is a good plan to cover it not more than three inches at first and to fill up the trench  Fig. 105 Ordinary layer of grape as soon as the shoots grow. It CtPart and madC int tW  lnt  covered four in ches deep at once, the young growth will sometimes rot, though this seldom happens, and some skilful growers fill the trench full at once. In the autumn roots will be found growing from each joint and these may be cut apart and treated as recommended for weak vines grown from cuttings.	To ensure success, it is essential that the soil used for layering is well-drained and rich in organic matter. Adding compost or aged manure can greatly enhance the soil's fertility and improve its structure, promoting healthier root development. Once the layers are established and the roots have sufficiently formed, typically by late fall, each section can be carefully separated from the parent plant.  When cutting the rooted sections, use a sharp, clean knife or pruning shears to avoid damaging the plant. Each section should have a good portion of roots and at least one strong shoot. After separation, the new plants should be transplanted into prepared holes that are spacious enough to accommodate the root system without crowding. It is advisable to water these new transplants thoroughly and provide a layer of mulch to conserve moisture and suppress weed growth. During the first year after transplanting, it is crucial to maintain consistent soil moisture and provide protection from extreme temperatures. A light application of a balanced fertilizer can encourage vigorous growth but should be used sparingly to prevent overstimulation, which can lead to weak, susceptible plants	1914	2003.4236

The first was an epigraph which he had made for the portrait of his dear Garrick, and which he entitles: PLURES IN UNO En Ini sent on voit plnsieurB hoinmea ; Lui seal noas offre les tableaux De mille et mille originanx, Tant des siecles passes qne dti siecle oil nons sums."	The second piece was a playful ode, a tribute to Garrick's unmatched ability to capture the essence of varied characters on the stage, portraying them with such depth and realism that they seemed to step right out of history and into the present.  In his letter, he wrote of how each performance by Garrick was a masterclass in the human condition, a mirror held up to the nature of man that transcended the boundaries of time and place. He praised Garrick for his skill in not just playing a part, but becoming it, breathing life into the words of playwrights long departed and ideas long thought faded.  He closed his letter with a reflection on the power of art to connect us across the ages, to convey truths about humanity that were as relevant in the courts of Elizabeth as they were in the bustling streets of Georgian London. He expressed his anticipation for their next meeting, perhaps in the spring, when the world would be reborn in verdancy and they could share in the rejuvenation of both nature and art.  Thus, with a flourish of his quill, he sealed	1912	1992.4589
Even that large body of Germans now upon the scene were experiencing great difficulty in defending themselves. A perfect rain of bullets seemed directed upon them on every hand, and today's experience certainly proves that Londoners are patriotic and brave, and in their own districts they possess a superiority over the trained troops of the Kaiser. At length, after a most sanguinary struggle, the Londoners' position was carried, the houses were entered, and twenty-two brave patriots, mostly of the working class, taken prisoners. The populace now realising that the Germans had, after all, overpowered their comrades in their fortress, fell back ; but being pursued northward towards the railway line between Highbury and Barnsbury Stations, many of them were dispatched on the spot. What followed was indeed terrible. The anger of the Germans now became uncontrollable.	They began to retaliate with a ferocity that was unprecedented, even in the harsh standards of warfare. The streets, which had echoed with the cries of battle, now resounded with the wails of the wounded and the bereaved. Civilians, caught in the crossfire or mistaken for combatants, suffered alongside the armed defenders. The air was thick with smoke and the acrid smell of gunpowder, the pavements stained with blood. Houses that had stood for centuries were reduced to rubble, historical landmarks became mere memories in a matter of hours. The city, so vibrant and full of life, was transformed into a scene of desolation and despair. Amidst this chaos, the resolve of the Londoners never wavered. Even as they retreated, their spirits remained unbroken, their determination to resist oppression as strong as ever. This dark day would be remembered not just for the brutality inflicted upon the city, but for the courage and resilience of its people. They had shown that even in the face of overwhelming odds, their will to fight for their homes and freedom remained	1906	1987.7611
"It was entrusted to a confidential compositor who did his work late at night behind the locked doors of a small job room. Even the foreman of the paper did not see so much as the type until the composing room had been completely deserted, and he alone, under Hart's watchful eye, was about to lock up the first page form. So cautious was Hart in protecting his ""beat, "" that after guarding the composing room in person until the forms had been lowered, he followed the last one to the press room, not losing sight of it for an instant; and then he and I remained in the press room until daybreak to see that no copy of the paper got out before he himself had given the word. The press room doors were locked; Hart held the key; and for two hours beyond delivery time the stereotypers and pressmen were imprisoned within, while the belated newsdealers pounded impatiently upon the door from without."	This unusual delay in distribution caused a commotion and confusion among the city's early risers eager for their morning read. The newsboys, shuffling in the chilly pre-dawn, swapped theories and rumors as to the cause of the holdup. But Hart remained unmoved by their complaints and the growing clamor outside the press room. His singular focus was on ensuring the exclusivity and integrity of the scoop he had secured. Inside, the rhythmic churn of the presses was the only sound accompanying the tense atmosphere. Every now and then, Hart would pace the length of the room, his sharp eyes scanning every movement around him, vigilant for any sign of a breach in his carefully laid plans. I, too, felt the weight of responsibility, aware that the success of our night’s efforts rested equally on my ability to follow Hart’s stringent protocols. As the sky began to lighten, a hint of dawn creeping through the small high windows of the press room, the tension reached its peak. The workers inside, aware of the unusual situation but accustomed to their routines, exchanged nervous glances, their	1911	1995.4603
Naturally, the family sentiment tends to atrophy. As naturally, the efficiency of the family tends to atrophy. What the great family group was able to do in the provision of food, of home, of education, of social service generally, the elemental families of three cannot achieve in the same fashion. And the child of each family must suffer, or a new method of service must be discovered. But no two strata of society in a city are at the same stage of development.	The upper strata, with their greater resources, can still simulate the old family functions with the aid of hired service—nurses, tutors, and the like. The middle strata, pressed by the necessity to economize yet striving to maintain a semblance of the traditional family structure, often find themselves stretched thin, their energies dissipated across too many demands. And the lower strata, those most acutely feeling the pinch of economic and social constraints, frequently see the family unit not as a source of support but as yet another arena of struggle. This divergence in familial efficacy across social layers only serves to entrench existing inequalities. The children of more affluent families receive not only the material benefits of their position but also the educational and social advantages that come with them. Meanwhile, children from less privileged backgrounds often miss out on both the tangible resources and the intangible nurturing that are critical to their development. Thus, as the traditional family unit diminishes in its capacity to serve its original role, society must either innovate new structures to fulfill these essential functions or accept the widening of societal gaps. This could	1908	2005.7222
"The new cruiser detachment was to join the two ships of the "" County "" class already at Kirkwall, move cautiously south, with six ocean going destroyers and six of the older destroyers, along the Scotch coast, establish its base at Aberdeen or Rosyth, and raid the German line of communications. It was to be known as the Northern Squadron, and was placed under the orders of Rear admiral Jeffries, an able and enterprising officer. In case the Germans moved against it in force, it was to retire northwards, but its commander was given to understand that on September 17 the main British Fleet would advance from the north and south into the North Sea and deliver its attack upon the massed force of the German Navy. Meanwhile, in preparation for the great movement, assiduous drill and target practice proceeded in the neighbourhood of Portland."	The ships were tuned to the highest state of readiness, their crews drilled relentlessly in gunnery, damage control, and tactical maneuvers. The air was thick with the tension of impending action, each man aware of the gravity of the situation and the crucial role they were to play in the days to come. Admiral Jeffries, fully cognizant of the weight of his responsibilities, held frequent conferences with his staff officers and the captains of the vessels under his command. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a vigilant watch and the need for swift, decisive action when called upon. His plan was to use the mobility and range of his cruisers to harass and disrupt the enemy, drawing them out while avoiding a full-scale engagement until the arrival of the main fleet. Onboard the ships, sailors and officers alike speculated about the upcoming conflict. Rumors circulated about the strength and capabilities of the German fleet, and many pondered the strategic implications of the Northern Squadron's mission. The older destroyers, though not as modern or powerful as their newer counterparts, were crewed by seasoned veterans who knew the	1906	1967.5502
10 and 11, described in the Ninth Report to the Alloys Research Committee. A very considerable number of tests on Duralumin have been made at the National Physical Laboratory in various connexions In the case of wire tensile strengths as high as 33 tonnes per square inch have been obtained, accompanied with from 5 to 7 percent, of elongation on 8 inches. In the case of the material used in the construction of the airship at Barrow, tensile strengths up * See Appendix to thi9 Report, p. 306. 300 to 28 tonnes per square inch, accompanied by an elongation of 17 percent, on 3 inches have been obtained. These figures correspond with a specific tenacity of 277.	kilograms per square millimeter. It must be noted that these properties were achieved after a series of heat treatments which were specifically designed to enhance the ductility and strength of the Duralumin. These treatments often include solution heat treating followed by quenching and aging, which precipitate a fine dispersion of strengthening phases within the aluminum alloy matrix. Further investigations into the fatigue resistance of Duralumin have also shown promising results. The fatigue strength, which is crucial for cyclically loaded structures such as aircraft wings, was found to be exceptionally high relative to the material's density. This characteristic makes Duralumin an ideal choice for applications where both lightness and durability are required. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of Duralumin, particularly when properly treated with surface coatings such as anodizing, has been satisfactory for many aerospace applications. However, it is important to consider that in marine environments or under high salinity conditions, additional protective measures might be necessary to prevent pitting and intergranular corrosion. The versatility of Duralumin is further demonstrated by its adaptability in various forms including sheets, plates	1912	1996.0787
Besides, the excuse is not well founded in fact. The worst element in this country is not in the majority nor has it the greater power. The better element of the electors is in the ascendancy both in numbers nd in strength, just as good is more powerful than evil. This has been proved over and over again in political contests, particularly in local municipal affairs where the people have been brought face to face with evil conditions and thereby aroused to activity. This was conspicuously proved in the city of Los Angeles, California, where the people arose in their might and by their votes ousted a mayor from office, on a charge of corruption in office, and elected as his successor a citizen chosen by the law abid ing element of the city against the corrupting power of the machine politicians  40 and their allies, the saloons, the utility corporations and others with whom they operated. This can be done anywhere, everywhere, in this free and enlightened country of ours, if only the electors who believe in good government will do their duty and vote their sentiments, instead of staying at home on election day and making false excuses for the neglect of a sacred obligation.	The duty of the voter does not end with merely casting a ballot; it extends to staying informed, to participating actively in discussions and debates, and to holding elected officials accountable once they are in office. This active participation reinforces the framework of democracy and ensures that the governance remains transparent and truly representative of the people’s will. Furthermore, the idea that one’s vote does not count or that all politicians are the same serves only to undermine the democratic process and give more power to those who would use it for their own ends. Each vote contributes to the shaping of policies and the direction in which a community, state, and even the nation moves.  In smaller, local elections, where the outcome can hinge on a handful of votes, the impact of each vote is even more pronounced. Here, citizens have a unique opportunity to effect change at a grassroots level, to shape their immediate surroundings in ways that directly affect their day-to-day lives. Therefore, it is imperative that all citizens recognize the power of their vote and the responsibility that comes with it. It is only through the concerted efforts of the entire community	1911	1988.8591
However, it is more a community of interests and political institutions than it is a racial identity that makes us class them together and speak of the Slavish and Hungarian immigrant as practically of the same kind. In reality these two stocks are essentially different and have shown rather wide differences in their respective abilities to adopt the ways of western civilization. The true Hungarians or Magyars are a Mongolian or Turanian stock. They left their Asiatic home about 1,000 years ago and descended upon Europe as a barbarous horde that for fifty years struck terror into the hearts of the neighbouring inhabitants of Germany and Italy.	The Slavs, on the other hand, are of Indo-European origin and have a much longer history of settlement in Europe. Their expansion across the continent has been marked by a series of migrations and settlements that predate the Magyar invasion by centuries. Unlike the Magyars, the Slavic peoples did not arrive as conquerors but rather as settlers, gradually assimilating and being assimilated by the indigenous populations of the regions they moved into. The differences in their historical origins and migrations have led to distinct cultural developments. The Slavs, spread over a vast area from Russia to the Balkans, have developed a variety of languages and customs, though they share certain cultural traits such as linguistic roots and religious traditions. The Magyars, having established their kingdom in what is now Hungary, maintained a distinct identity, with a language and cultural practices that set them apart from their Slavic neighbors. In terms of adapting to Western civilization, these historical and cultural differences have played significant roles. The Slavs, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe, were influenced earlier by their interactions with Germanic and	1911	1982.5643
It should embody every item of prior and contemporaneous agreements that they intend shall be the basis of the contract. It should not only provide for present and exist ing conditions, but should anticipate every difficulty and controversy that may arise in the execution of the contract or the prosecution of the work.	Furthermore, it should include specific provisions for the resolution of disputes, including the designation of an arbitrator or a process for arbitration. The contract should also outline the responsibilities and liabilities of all parties involved, ensuring that each knows their role and the consequences of non-compliance. This is essential in maintaining a clear understanding and preventing legal disputes. Additionally, the contract should address the terms of payment, schedules for completion, standards of workmanship, material specifications, and conditions for termination. Each of these elements serves to protect the interests of both parties and ensures that the project progresses smoothly.  It is also prudent to include clauses that cover unforeseen circumstances, such as force majeure events, that could impact the delivery and completion of the project. This not only provides a plan for such events but also offers protection for both parties should the project be delayed or cancelled due to circumstances beyond their control. In essence, a well-crafted contract is a blueprint for the entire project. It should be comprehensive, clear, and crafted with foresight, taking into account not just the needs of the project at the moment	1913	1997.8491
"Here at the very outset we have illustrated in the individual the regularity of what have come to be called phonetic laws. The term ""phonetic law "" is justified in so far as a common tendency is to be discovered in a large number of individual sound changes. It is important, however, to understand that phonetic law is a purely historic concept, not one comparable to the laws of natural science."	Phonetic laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive, outlining how sounds have typically changed over time within specific languages or dialects under similar conditions, rather than dictating how they must change. This distinction highlights the adaptability and variability inherent in linguistic evolution. As languages are living entities influenced by numerous social, geographical, and individual factors, the manifestation of these phonetic changes can often be diverse and complex. The application of phonetic laws is crucial in the field of historical linguistics, where scholars attempt to reconstruct older languages and understand the relationships between different languages by examining systematic sound changes. For instance, the well-known Grimm’s Law describes a specific set of consonant shifts that occurred in the Germanic languages as they diverged from other Indo-European languages. This type of systematic observation allows linguists to trace the evolution of languages and their familial ties. Furthermore, while phonetic laws can predict certain patterns of sound change, exceptions to these laws are not uncommon. These exceptions can be due to a variety of factors, such as loanwords from other languages, dialectal variations, or irregular transmission of linguistic	1911	2007.0643

It is a curious and rather disheartening spectacle."" Longfellow nodded sympathetically, his own experiences with the press having similarly oscillated between misinterpretation and trivialization. ""It is the artist's burden,"" he remarked thoughtfully, ""to be seen yet not understood, to be admired yet not comprehended in the fullness of one's passion and intent."" The lady looked out the window, her eyes tracing the lines of the horizon as if seeking solace in its vastness.

inches, 1 square inch of bending moment diagram area represents q. s lb. (inches)2, and q. s also represents radians slope if E is in pounds per square inch and I in (inches units.

The quantity — I Mxdx represents the moment about the origin of the area of the bending moment diagram between X2 and xr If A is this area and x is the distance of its centre of gravity or centroid from the origini I Mxdx J Xl may be represented by A .	x̅, where x̅ is the centroid of the area A under the bending moment diagram. This leads to the basic principle that the area under the bending moment diagram, when multiplied by the distance from the origin to the centroid of this area, gives us the moment of the area about the origin, which corresponds to the deflection at any point along the beam. To further calculate the actual deflection, one must consider the influence of the material properties (modulus of elasticity, E, and moment of inertia, I) and the geometry of the beam. The deflection, δ, at any point can therefore be expressed as: δ = (1/EI) * A * x̅ This formula is essential in structural engineering for determining how much a beam will bend under a given load, which is crucial for ensuring that structures are safe and perform as expected. Moreover, the relationship between the bending moment and the curvature of the beam can also be derived from the bending moment diagram. The curvature, κ, at any point along the beam is given by: κ = M/E	1908	1948.9337
Each man, when obeying the Imperial command to join the German arms, had placed in the lapel of his coat a button of a peculiar shape, with which he had long ago been provided, and by which he was instantly recognised as a loyal subject of the Kaiser. This huge body of German solders, who for years had passed in England as civilians, was, of course, of enormous use to Von Kronhelm, for they acted as guides not only on the march and during the entry to London, but materially assisted in the victorious advance in the Midlands. Indeed, the Germans had for years kept a civilian army in England, and yet we had, ostrich like, buried our heads in the sand and refused to turn our eyes to the grave peril that had for so long threatened. Systematically, the Germans were visiting every shop and warehouse in the shopping districts, and seizing everything eatable they could discover.	They commandeered horses, vehicles, and even bicycles, to transport their spoils back to their encampments. The local populace, already reeling from the suddenness of the invasion, found themselves powerless against the well-organized and meticulously planned operations of the German forces. The streets, once bustling with the daily commerce and chatter of a vibrant city, were now eerily quiet, punctuated only by the marching boots of soldiers and the occasional cries of protest from local shopkeepers as their livelihoods were carted away. London's iconic landmarks, which had stood as silent witnesses to centuries of history, now served as strategic points for German surveillance and command posts. The sense of occupation was palpable, with German flags appearing over public buildings and important thoroughfares. The swift and effective control of communication networks further tightened Von Kronhelm's grip on the city, leaving its inhabitants cut off from the outside world and any hope of immediate relief. In the broader scope of the invasion, this strategy of embedding soldiers within the civilian population prior to open hostilities represented a chilling evolution of warfare tactics.

[ '33 ]  First, it belongs to the state and not to the individual. When the private man assumes to punish evil with force he sanctions lynch law, which is a terror to the innocent as well as to the guilty. Then we have the blood feud and the vendetta, mob rule and anarchy. Second, the suppression of evil by force is only a temporary relief, a protection for the moment. It does not touch the root of the matter. You send the murderer out of the world by a regulated flash of lightning. But you do not send murder out of the world. To do that you must reach and change the heart of Cain.	Third, the true role of the state in these matters is to act as a deterrent and reformer, not merely as an executor of vengeance. It is imperative that society seeks to rehabilitate rather than simply to punish. By focusing on correction and education, the state can address the underlying issues that lead to criminal behaviors, thereby reducing the likelihood of their recurrence. Fourth, it is essential to remember that the exercise of force by the state must always be governed by justice and tempered with mercy. The administration of law should not be driven by the impulses of anger or revenge, but should be a considered response, proportionate to the wrongdoing and aimed at the greater good of the community. Lastly, the ultimate goal should be the restoration of peace and order, with an emphasis on preventing harm and fostering a society where all can thrive in safety and harmony. Only through a balanced approach that combines deterrence, rehabilitation, and just enforcement can the state effectively suppress evil without perpetuating cycles of violence and retribution.	1908	1975.2042
Can any study of imitation as a psychical process give the teacher the slightest hint as to what models  10   for imitation ought to be put before the mind of the pupil? Is it more valuable to imitate the hero or the scholar or the martyr or the athlete or the captain of industry? Is it more valuable to imitate unscrupulous success or humble honesty, the life of self-denial or the life of glory? Some model for the imitation of the boys must be in the soul of every teacher — can the psychology or physiology or sociology of imitation decide which model is the right one? To ask the question means to answer it in the negative.	The choice of a model for imitation transcends purely empirical observations and enters the realm of ethics and values. It involves a consideration of what qualities we deem most desirable in a human being. The teacher, as a moral guide, must weigh these qualities carefully, considering not only the immediate impact of such models on the pupil but also the long-term implications for their character development. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a model also depends on its relevance and resonance with the pupil’s own life and experiences. A model that is too distant from a pupil’s reality might fail to inspire or might even alienate. Therefore, teachers must also consider the individuality of each pupil, their social environment, and their potential when selecting models for imitation. Ultimately, the teacher's role in guiding imitation is not merely to provide a model, but to cultivate the pupil's ability to critically assess and choose whom to emulate. This involves teaching pupils not only to appreciate admirable qualities in others but also to recognize and foster these qualities within themselves. Thus, the task is not simply one of presenting a model but of fostering an environment where ethical discern	1909	1999.4076
The right half of the line — with the exception of Maldon itself — is very flat, and offers no very advantageous positions for defence, especially as the ground slopes upwards in the direction of the enemy's attack. It is, however, but a gradual slope. Towards the left, though, there is higher ground, affording fairly good gun positions, and this we must hold on to at all hazards. This, in fact, will be the real key of the position.	The enemy, should they gain this elevation, would command not only our entire line but also the road to the rear, which must remain open for our supplies and possible reinforcements. Therefore, our strategy must focus on strengthening our left flank and ensuring that it is bolstered with sufficient artillery and infantry to repel any assault.  We must also consider the placement of reserves. They should be positioned centrally, behind the main line, so they can be quickly deployed to the left should the need arise. It is imperative that communication lines between the units are kept open and functioning, as swift conveyance of orders and information will be crucial in reacting to enemy movements. Additionally, we should employ scouts to monitor the enemy's advance, providing us with early warning of their approach which would allow us to prepare adequately. Field fortifications, such as trenches and wire entanglements, should be constructed on the vulnerable flat terrain on the right to delay any enemy advancements and channel them towards areas where we have a stronger defensive setup.  By holding the higher ground on the left and fortifying our positions, we can create	1906	1973.7877
"As an impartial historian this author draws attention to the discrepancy existing between the noble and sublime teaching '. Christ and the practice of his followers. Beginning with the .sliest history of the Bishops of Rome, who soon became the spiritual rulers of Christendom, he deals with the morality of the priests and the various love affairs of the Popes. The words of the prophet, ""and the women rule over us, "" may literally be applied to the history of the Papacy during the middle ages and the Renaissance. For not only were such famous courtesans as Theodora and Marozia the actual rulers of the Vatican, and in possession of the Keys of Heaven, but a woman one day ascended the throne of St Peter and became Pope. The author further relates the story of Pope Alexander VI. and Signora Venozza, of Pope Leo X. and a French Court beauty, of sutus V. and the beautiful English heretic Anna Osten, of Innocent X. and his sister-in-law Olympia, and of many other Popes. Or."	these accounts, the historian does not fail to emphasize the stark contrast with the virtuous ideals propounded in Christian teachings. He carefully documents each case, drawing from a variety of historical texts and sources to present a balanced view. Despite these transgressions, he also notes periods of reform and moments of genuine piety among the clergy, showing the complexity of the church's history. His analysis extends to the impact of such discrepancies on the laity, discussing how the moral failings of spiritual leaders influenced the religious and social fabric of the time. He explores how these contradictions occasionally fueled reform movements within the church and sometimes led to widespread disillusionment among believers. Throughout, the historian remains committed to an unbiased narrative, acknowledging the human capacity for both great moral failings and profound righteousness, thus painting a nuanced picture of historical events.	1912	2006.0342
y (Art. 61) M = s) or \%(z?8y) . . (3) The sum S(ySa), or %(zylly), represents the limiting value of the sum of the products of elements of area, multiplied by the squares of their distances from the axis, when the elements of area are diminished indefinitely, and is usually called the Moment of Inertia of the area of the section about the axis. The values of the moments of inertia for various sections are dealt with in Arts. 66-68. If we denote the moment of inertia of the area of the section by I, so that — 2(/8«) = %(zfty) = I the formula (3) becomes — E. ME  io [CH. IV.	The importance of the moment of inertia lies in its ability to quantify the rotational inertia of a body about a given axis. This is crucial in the analysis of structural stability and dynamics, particularly in the fields of civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering. The moment of inertia is not only a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation rate but also plays a key role in determining the bending stress in beams and the torsional stress in shafts. Art. 66 delves into the calculation of moments of inertia for common geometric shapes such as rectangles, circles, and triangles. For example, the moment of inertia of a rectangle about an axis through its centroid and parallel to one of its sides is given by \( \frac{bh^3}{12} \), where \( b \) is the width and \( h \) is the height of the rectangle. Art. 67 extends these concepts to composite areas, which are common in practical engineering applications. This involves the use of the parallel axis theorem, which states that the moment of inertia about any axis parallel to and a distance \(	1908	2005.2458
Never in her life had she been so ordered about. The strict rules of the house had seemed to her intolerable. She was a martinet herself, and inclined to pay all due attention to the observances of  239 religion; but they must be her own observances, or at least approved by her. To be expected to follow other people's observances set her aflame. To make such a fuss, also, about your religion seemed to her indecorous and absurd. She remembered with a satisfaction which was half ashamed that she — who was always down at home to a half past eight breakfast, and was accustomed to walk a mile to church — had insisted on breakfasting in her own room, on Sunday, under the Newburys' roof, and had quite enjoyed Lady William's surprised looks when they met at luncheon. Well, now the thing had to be done again — for the settling of Marcia.	She would have to return to that stifling environment, adhere to those rigid schedules, and once more participate in what she perceived as their exaggerated displays of piety. The thought alone made her spine stiffen, her resolve harden like the ice on a winter's pond. It was not that she lacked faith or devotion; indeed, her spirituality was deeply rooted and personal, a quiet, steady flame rather than a public bonfire. Yet, as she prepared for this unavoidable journey, she contemplated how she might better shield her own practices from intrusion this time around. She would need to establish boundaries, assert her independence in matters of personal worship, and perhaps negotiate some concessions with the Newburys. After all, a little diplomacy could perhaps make her stay more bearable without compromising her autonomy. Marcia, sweet, impressionable Marcia, would be watching her closely, learning not just from what was taught, but also from what was observed. It was crucial, therefore, that she modeled not just tolerance and respect for other's rituals, but also the courage to honor her own beliefs amidst them	1913	1989.5704
"I., p. 125. '' Education must seek to develop social action. It can take no account of possible thought or feeling which exercises no influence upon one's behaviour. . . . The school can not have for its leading principle the improvement of the individual as an isolated being.'' — O 'Shea, '' Education as Adjustment, '' p. 95. ""Education for culture alone tends to isolate the individual; education for sympathy with one's environment tends to make the individual an integral part of the activities and progress of his time."""	Education, therefore, must be a blend of both personal development and social integration. It should aim not only to refine the individual's intellect and aesthetic sensibilities but also to foster an understanding of and a commitment to the community. The school, as a microcosm of society, has the responsibility to cultivate citizens who are not only knowledgeable but also empathetic and engaged. This dual focus—on the individual and the collective—ensures that education does not merely produce solitary scholars but active, contributing members of society.  In this light, the curriculum should be designed to encourage active participation in societal issues, to develop skills that are applicable in real-world scenarios, and to promote teamwork and collaborative problem-solving. Moreover, the educational environment should be one that values diversity, encourages open dialogue and critical thinking, and teaches respect for multiple perspectives. Through such an approach, education becomes a powerful tool for social change, preparing individuals not just to thrive on their own but to lift others as they climb.	1911	2003.0502
"I inquired if five — five ordinary pounds — would. I had just received emolument to that extent for a week's diligent labour at my bank. Not to detain you unnecessarily, my dear sir, the drover, after expressing the belief that there were more blistering funny blokes in the world than he had previously reckoned to be the case, and after wondering what I thought I was going to do with it (as to the which I was very far from clear), pocketed my five sovereigns and made off at a speed which advertised some apprehension lest I should change my mind. "" Conceive me, my dear sir, left on the doorstep of a London lodging house with Wilfred Wump Brabazon, of the Foreign Office, Whitehall, S. W., in the form of a sheep, and with a crowd that had by now thickened out into the roadway and was indulging in much free handed comment at my expense. ""'Get me inside, ' implored the sheep. 'Get me into the house, Arthur."	Do it quickly before this mob makes a spectacle of us both.' With considerable effort and no small amount of awkwardness, I managed to hoist the creature, still bleating pitifully in my arms, and shuffled toward the door. I thrust it open with my shoulder, nearly toppling over in the process, but finally gaining entry into the dimly lit hall of the lodging house. The landlady, Mrs. Higgins, emerged from the back room, a look of utter astonishment crossing her features as she took in the sight of her tenant cradling a sheep like a child. 'Mr. Arthur, what on earth—?' she began, her words trailing off into a bewildered silence. 'I can explain,' I said, though I was quite sure I could not, at least not in any way that would make sense to Mrs. Higgins or any rational human being. 'Please, might we use your sitting room for a moment? It's rather urgent.' Without waiting for an answer, I maneuvered past her and deposited Wilfred Wump Brabazon—or the	1913	1902.5819

On the first day, a cold front lying in an east west direction over the Atlantic passes onshore over Georgia, from which point it becomes a warm front extending northwestward into a youthful cyclone centred over eastern Colorado.	By the second day, the cyclone has matured and shifted northeastward, pulling the warm front northward across the Midwestern states, while the cold front extends southward from the cyclone center into Texas. The system brings widespread rain and thunderstorms across these regions, with strong winds preceding the front.  On the third day, the cyclone continues its northeast trajectory, now positioned over the Great Lakes region. The warm front has pushed further into the Northeast, bringing mild and moist air from the Gulf, which clashes with the colder air from Canada, intensifying precipitation along the front. The cold front trails further south, now sweeping through the Gulf States and bringing cooler, drier air in its wake. By the fourth day, as the cyclone moves into Canada, it begins to weaken. The warm front dissipates, while the cold front clears the East Coast, leaving behind cooler temperatures and clearing skies. Behind the cold front, high pressure begins to build over the central United States, signaling the development of an anticyclone. This high-pressure system brings stable, dry conditions, effectively	1913	1998.0835
He unearthed the famous Temple of Bel, together with its great library, consisting of over 23,000 tablets, containing the chronicles of Bel. When a number of these tablets had been decyphered, they were found to contain a complete system of philosophy, science, and religion, and proved that those ancient people knew many things about astronomy, and in some of the fundamental matters would not have much to learn from astronomers of the present day. These tablets contained, amongst other things, records of observations of Mars ! It is claimed that Chinese records go back to a still more remote date. Since the discovery of the telescope our knowledge of Mars has gradually extended, and its general surface configuration is now well known to all students of the planet. The polar snow caps were early depicted on draw 256  From a Globe made by f. Wicks Plate XIII MARS.	"ings and maps, changing in size with the Martian seasons, a phenomenon that suggested a climate and perhaps even weather patterns not unlike those of Earth. The dark and light areas were also recorded with increasing detail, leading to much speculation about their nature. Were they seas and continents, or something else entirely? Subsequent observations revealed the shifting nature of these dark patches, which waxed and waned in a manner that some attributed to vegetation growth cycles, further fueling the imagination of those who pondered the possibility of life on Mars. This led to the creation of detailed maps by astronomers such as Giovanni Schiaparelli, who in the late 19th century introduced the term ""canali"" for the network of linear markings he observed, which was unfortunately translated into English as ""canals,"" implying an artificial origin. These canals stirred public and scientific debate, divided between skeptics and those who embraced the idea of an advanced Martian civilization. The debate intensified with Percival Lowell's enthusiastic advocacy for an inhabited Mars, where intelligent beings constructed the canals to channel water from the polar ice caps to"	1911	1984.7671
The burner is guaranteed for 1,000 hours, but the average life is stated to be actually longer. Furthermore, it is never necessary to clean the globe. In addition to the high luminous efficiency, the lamp has the advantages that the tube only requires replacement at rare intervals, and the lamp needs no attention while working. Lamps can also be operated in parallel on 110 volts or 220 volts, or on traction circuits of 460 to 600 volts. These advantages are claimed to outweigh the comparatively high first cost due to the high value of the raw material. The curve in Fig.	17 illustrates the performance of the lamp over time, showing a slight degradation in luminosity after the initial 500 hours, which then stabilizes for the remainder of the operational lifespan. This is a typical characteristic of this type of lamp, where the efficacy slightly diminishes but remains within a high-performance range, making it suitable for continuous and long-term use. The lamp's design also incorporates a robust mechanism for dissipating heat, which significantly contributes to its longevity and stable operation. The heat management system ensures that the critical components are maintained at optimal temperatures, thus preventing premature failure due to thermal stress. Furthermore, the lamp's electromagnetic compatibility has been thoroughly tested. It exhibits minimal electromagnetic interference (EMI), which makes it ideal for use in environments where EMI could disrupt the operation of sensitive electronic devices. In practical applications, these lamps have been successfully used in a variety of settings, ranging from industrial environments to public infrastructure projects. Their reliability and efficiency have been proven in field tests and real-world applications, underscoring their suitability for both high-demand commercial settings and areas requiring dependable, long-lasting illumination. 	1912	1993.9688
The writer has good reason to remember well the old Biological Hall of the University of Pennsylvania. It cost perhaps $30,000; it was likely not only to burn down but to tumble down. Yet in that building some twenty years ago worked Leidy, Cope and Rider, with two other professors in the zoological sciences, two professors of botany and a professor of psychology, all actively engaged in research work. Our universities doubtless need big buildings, but the need of great men is far more urgent. SCIENTIFIC ITEMS We record with regret the deaths of the Eev.	Dr. Samuel Langhorne, an esteemed botanist known for his extensive studies on North American flora, and Professor George M. Turner, a prominent physicist whose research contributed significantly to the understanding of electromagnetic theory. Both were revered members of the scientific community and will be deeply missed for their contributions and mentorship. In other news, the scientific community is abuzz with the recent discovery by Dr. Emily Carter at Princeton University. Dr. Carter and her team have developed a new catalyst that significantly enhances the efficiency of water electrolysis, a breakthrough that could pave the way for more sustainable energy solutions by improving hydrogen production. Attention is also drawn to the upcoming international conference on climate change, set to take place in Geneva next month. This event will gather leading scientists, policymakers, and activists from around the globe to discuss strategies for combating global warming and its effects on biodiversity. The conference is expected to produce a set of actionable recommendations that will influence environmental policies worldwide. In addition, there is considerable excitement about the launch of the Lunar Research Satellite, scheduled for later this year. This satellite, a joint venture	1911	1993.7683
The division of heat has had a particularly arduous task to perform. In contrast to the certainty and permanency of standards of length and mass, and of electrical quantities, there have been great discrepancies in temperature scales and the thermal constants depending on them. The standards used by different makers of thermometers were not in agreement with one another, nor did they agree with the accepted gas scale. There were marked differences even between the usual limits of freezing and boiling, or 0° and 100° C. When the work on thermometry was undertaken, a large percent. of american made thermometers for temperatures as high as 400° to 500° C. were subject to changes of 30° or 40° when exposed to the high temperatures they were designed to measure. Further, the average clinical thermometers, used so extensively by physicians, were subject to errors exceeding the limit of tolerance.	To rectify these discrepancies, significant efforts were made toward the standardization of temperature measurements. The International Temperature Scale of 1927, later updated in 1948 and again in 1968, was established to provide a consistent framework for temperature measurement across various scientific and industrial applications. This scale was based on fixed points which are reproducible temperatures associated with phase transitions of certain pure substances, such as the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure. Additionally, advances in materials science led to the development of more stable substances for thermometer bulbs and more reliable thermometric fluids that were less prone to volume changes under varying temperature conditions. The introduction of platinum resistance thermometers offered a higher degree of precision, as platinum's electrical resistance changes in a predictable manner with temperature. Moreover, the establishment of calibration laboratories helped ensure that thermometers were regularly tested against standard references. These facilities provided services where thermometers could be sent to check their accuracy and recalibrate if necessary. This practice helped reduce the variability in temperature measurement and increased confidence in the readings obtained from such instruments. The push towards	1911	1998.3575
The Collegiata has yet another claim on our interest, since two hundred years after the death of Santa Fina, during the Lenten season of 1484, its walls rang with the fiery eloquence of the young Savonarola as he denounced with prophetic power and passion the luxuries and vices of his beautiful and proudly pagan age. The Dominican monastery in which he was entertained has since been converted into a penitentiary, while the luxury of the San Gimignanese, which he declared to be a stench in the nostrils of Almighty God, has given way to an almost monastic poverty on the part of their descendants. The walls of our bedrooms at San Gimignano offered, I believe, the only modern touch about the place, as they were elaborately frescoed in triumphant imitation of American wall paper, which the enterprising little proprietor evidently coveted but could not afford.	The irony of this luxurious mimicry in a town steeped in such austere historical echoes was not lost on us as we wandered through the narrow, cobbled streets. San Gimignano, once the haunt of wealthy merchants and the battleground of opposing nobles, now lay subdued, its medieval towers casting long shadows over quiet piazzas where elderly men played scopa and children kicked footballs with the casual indifference of the young to the weight of history. Despite its transformation, the town retained a proud sort of beauty, a testament to its resilience and the enduring appeal of its architectural heritage. The Collegiata itself, standing with a quiet dignity, seemed to watch over San Gimignano. Its stone facade, weathered yet imposing, whispered tales of the past to those who would listen—tales of Santa Fina's sanctity and Savonarola's fiery sermons that once filled the nave and echoed off its ancient walls. Inside, the church was a cavern of cool shadows and the faint smell of incense, the air alive with the soft murmurs of tourists and	1911	1983.0511
Pruning is usually    .35  done at any time during the winter when there is no frost in the wood. Pruning tools will break much easier when the wood is frosty. The winter is often the slack season in fruit districts and the work can be done cheaper then. Some pruning may be  done at the end of the growing season in late summer, but this is apt to start a late fall growth which is objectionable in the colder districts. Cut Close and Clean.

Dull blades can damage the bark and wood, leading to poor healing and increased susceptibility to disease. When removing a limb, cut just outside the branch collar—the swollen area where the branch joins the trunk or another limb. This helps preserve the tree’s natural protective mechanisms and promotes faster healing. Third, remove any dead, diseased, or damaged branches first. These are not only unproductive but can also harbor pests and diseases that might spread to healthier parts of the tree. Afterward, thin out the branches to improve light penetration and air circulation within the canopy. This is crucial for reducing the risk of fungal infections and for promoting a more uniform ripening of fruit. Fourth, consider the future growth of the tree. Avoid cutting too many large branches from one side, as this could unbalance the tree’s structure. Aim to create a balanced, open framework that allows the tree to grow evenly and withstand strong winds. Lastly, clean your tools after pruning each tree to prevent the spread of any diseases.

The Hennings idea of what Nora is and means to do cannot be deemed amiss when it is considered that actress and author collaborated with a common language as their tool, and with inherent idiosyncrasies born of closely allied countries. Mrs. Hennings is Duse, Bernhardt, Mrs. Fiske rolled in one. She takes Ghosts, for instance, and goes to Berlin where this Ibsen play has been presented innumerable times by actors and actresses from various European countries and in several languages. Fru Alving, however, now for the first time in Berlin, speaks her lines in Norwegian, or rather Danish, which is almost the same. With an interval of one year and a half Fru Hen nings returns to Germany, and again her Fru Alving is the best characterization of the part witnessed in the country since she was there last.	Her portrayal, nuanced and deeply empathetic, transcends linguistic barriers, bringing to the forefront the universal themes of Ibsen's work. This ability to connect with audiences, irrespective of language, is a testament to Mrs. Hennings' profound understanding of the human condition—a trait that elevates her performances into the realm of the extraordinary. In her interpretation, Fru Alving is not merely a victim of societal norms but a complex character wrestling with her morality, her past, and her unyielding love for her son. Mrs. Hennings imbues the role with a palpable sense of internal conflict and resilience, crafting a Fru Alving who is both tragic and heroic in her defiance of her circumstances. Critics and audiences alike are captivated by her performance, which, though steeped in the traditions of her Scandinavian roots, achieves a compelling universality. Her return to the role in Germany is met with anticipation and acclaim, as theatre-goers are eager to experience once more her unique blend of subtlety and strength.

Some of the foreign species are quite large and grow to the height of 12 or 14 feet. The plants are generally propagated by seed layers and sometimes budding is practised. The flowers. The flowers are monoecious and form on tha new wood. The male flowers are grouped in the form of small catkins that may be seen on the bushes all winter. In the spring, these elongate and the pollen is distributed by the wind. The female flowers are inconspicuous and form a starlike tuft of crimson stigmas that push out from the rather large buds at the time the male flowers elongate. These flowers open early in the spring. QUESTIONS CHAPTER XV. Nuts. 1. Of what country is the pecan a native? 2. What soil is best for pecan growing? 3. How should they be planted and cultivated? 4.

What are the characteristics and distribution of the American chestnut? Of the European chestnut? Of the Japanese chestnut? 9. To what extent are they grown?	1. The pecan is native to the United States, particularly found in the southern and central regions including states like Texas, Georgia, and Mississippi. 2. Pecans thrive best in deep, well-drained sandy loam soil that is rich in organic matter. The soil should also have a neutral to slightly acidic pH. 3. Pecans should be planted in full sun during the dormant season, ideally in late winter or early spring. Trees should be spaced about 60-80 feet apart to allow for mature growth. Regular watering, mulching, and fertilization are essential for healthy growth. Cultivation practices should include annual pruning to maintain shape and promote air circulation. 4. Pecans are typically harvested in the fall when the husks split open and the nuts fall to the ground. They can be collected manually or with mechanical harvesters. Post-harvest, pecans are dried, cleaned, and often shelled before being marketed. 5. Common insects injurious to pecan trees include pecan weevils, hickory shuckworms, and aph	1914	2006.6259
The limits of the application of the theory are discussed later. It is probable that our present knowledge is sufficient to enable an aeroplane to be so constructed that it shall have both longitudinal and lateral stability. From what has already been said, however, it will be understood that the problem to be dealt with is more difficult than this. It is clearly possible that a machine may be over stable ; it then becomes insensitive to control, and will not steer readily ; and is liable to behave unsatisfactorily in gusty winds, owing to a tendency to change of attitude with every change in the relative wind.	The key, therefore, lies in achieving a balance where the aeroplane is stable enough to maintain its course in mild to moderate atmospheric disturbances, yet responsive enough to allow for agile maneuvering when required by the pilot. This delicate equilibrium is often referred to as 'dynamic stability,' which involves a machine's ability to return to a state of equilibrium after a disturbance, without being overly sluggish or oscillatory. In practical terms, this involves a careful design of the aircraft's aerodynamic surfaces. The size, shape, and angle of wings, tailplanes, and control surfaces must be optimized to provide the necessary lift and control forces under various flight conditions. Additionally, the distribution of mass and the location of the center of gravity play critical roles in how the aircraft responds to aerodynamic forces and moments. Moreover, modern advancements in flight control systems have allowed for more sophisticated management of stability issues. These systems can automatically adjust control surfaces in real-time to counteract destabilizing forces, thereby enhancing both stability and control responsiveness. Such systems are particularly useful in managing the complex interactions of aerodynamic forces during high-speed flight	1912	1994.3998
He is made to live, breathe and move among his people, the great justice loving, mercy dispensing King history shows him to have been. Now, to create a convincing character, as Mrs. Trask has done, from the meagre data at hand, evinces real imaginative genius on the part of an author; for the annals and records of Alfred, aside from his own literary work and written aspirations, while they are in one accord, showing him as brave a warrior as he was humane and peace loving a king; as gentle as he was gracious; as nobly religious as he was solicitous for the prosperity and happiness of his people — a man at once a king, scholar and patron of industry, yet are didactic and fragmentary presentations which fail to convey a full orbed picture of the King to the imagination of the general reader. From all this crude data, and especially from Alfred's literary work, the author has drawn material which she embodies in the play, creating an ideal King, in whom simplicity, regal manhood, love of wife and love of people, faith in God and service to man, unwavering loyalty to duty and a conscientious desire to help others are shadowed forth most convincingly.	This portrayal, while perhaps polished and romanticized beyond the strict lines of historical accuracy, nonetheless captures the essence of Alfred's character in a way that resonates deeply with contemporary audiences. Mrs. Trask's skill lies not only in her meticulous research but also in her ability to translate these historical fragments into a living, breathing entity that speaks directly to the human condition. Her Alfred is not a mere relic of the past, but a symbol of timeless virtues that transcend the ages.  In her narrative, every dialogue and scene meticulously reconstructs the socio-political climate of 9th-century England, imbuing it with a vibrancy that makes the distant past accessible and relevant. The struggles and triumphs of Alfred are depicted with such emotional depth that they echo the universal quest for justice and moral integrity. Through her artful blend of fact and fiction, Mrs. Trask allows the reader to explore the complexities of leadership and governance, and the perennial conflict between personal ambition and public duty. Furthermore, the author's depiction of Alfred’s court, with its intrigues and human drama, serves as a micro	1911	2007.1699
If the buds are thought to be too immature, they may be readily developed by pinching off the tips of the twigs. In ten or twelve days after such pinching, of even a very soft shoot, its buds will be fit for working. Fig. 80. Showing method of cutting bud when the wood is to be removed from it. b. Plum bud in the spring of the year before growth has commenced. c. A shoot started from an inserted bud and tied to the stub of a stock. The dotted line b shows where the stock should be cut off after the bud is well started. 3. The bark must separate easily from the wood on the stocks to be budded.	This condition is crucial for successful budding and usually occurs when the sap is flowing freely, typically in late spring to mid-summer. The ease with which the bark separates from the wood is a good indicator that the plant is in a vigorous state of growth, which is essential for the new bud to take and grow effectively. 4. To test if the stock is ready, a simple incision can be made at the proposed site of the budding. If the bark peels back smoothly without tearing, the stock is likely in the right condition for budding. Conversely, if the bark clings to the wood or tears, it is advisable to wait until the plant is more receptive. 5. Once the appropriate condition of the stock is confirmed, select a healthy bud from the donor plant. Using a sharp and clean knife, make a T-shaped cut on the stock where the bud is to be inserted. The horizontal cut should be no longer than the width of the bud to be inserted, and the vertical cut should be just deep enough to allow the insertion of the bud without excessive force. 6.

Resilience of Beams. — When a beam is bent within the elastic limits, the material is subjected to varying degrees of tensile and compressive bending stress, and therefore possesses elastic strain energy (Art. 41), ie. it is a spring, although it may be a stiff one.	The resilience of a beam, which is the capacity to absorb and release energy without permanent deformation, is an important factor in the design of structures subjected to dynamic loads such as bridges or buildings in seismic zones. The amount of energy a beam can absorb is directly related to both the material properties and its geometric configuration. To calculate the resilience of a beam, one must consider the area under the stress-strain curve up to the elastic limit. This area represents the work done per unit volume in deforming the beam and is given by the formula: \[ \text{Resilience} = \frac{1}{2} \sigma \epsilon \] where \( \sigma \) is the stress and \( \epsilon \) is the strain at the elastic limit. For a material with a linear stress-strain relationship, this can be simplified using Hooke's Law (\( \sigma = E \epsilon \)), giving: \[ \text{Resilience} = \frac{1}{2} E \epsilon^2 \] For a beam of length \( L \), cross-sectional area	1908	1999.8073
All these conditions are favourable to precipitation fog. Practically every warm front has an associated area of precipitation fog which, in extreme conditions, covers 500,000 square miles or more. Surface inversions created by nocturnal radiation or by falling precipitation become foggy when rain or snow pass through them. Excluding showers, wintertime rain or snow is more or less synonymous with fog and low clouds. FOG DEVELOPMENT UNDER Low OVERCAST. — A low overcast not associated with a warm or cold front but part of an airmass, when thick enough to produce a drizzle, often lowers its own base until it reaches the surface. Fog of this type is as much precipitation fog as that associated with the warm front. The depth of cloud needed to create a fine rain or drizzle frequently is as little as 1000 to 2000 feet.	This drizzle, when falling through the air beneath the cloud, gradually saturates the lower levels until visibility is reduced enough to classify the condition as fog. The cooling effect of the evaporation of drizzle also contributes to the lowering of the cloud base, enhancing the fog formation process. This kind of fog can persist for hours, especially if there is little wind to disperse the moisture-laden air. Such conditions are particularly common in coastal areas where maritime influences provide abundant moisture, and in valley regions where cold air pools at night, setting the stage for radiation inversions that trap moist air near the ground. In these scenarios, even a slight increase in humidity or a minor decrease in temperature can tip the balance towards fog formation. It’s important for forecasters to monitor the thickness and vertical extent of low overcast clouds, as well as the dew point and temperature gradient, to predict the likelihood and duration of precipitation fog events. Such predictions are crucial for aviation, maritime operations, and transportation safety, where visibility reductions can pose significant risks.	1913	1993.1979
But to maintain that none of the material used in the synthesis of higher fatty acids in plants or animals is ever derived from a source in proteins would certainly be going too far. If the analysis given above of the probable nature of the synthetic processes involved when fat is made from carbohydrate is not altogether beside the mark, then it may be pointed out that lactic acid may certainly equally well be formed from alanine as from glucose, and that acetic aldehyde may not unreasonably be supposed to arise in the breaking up of other groups that can be traced back to an origin in proteins, of the acetoacetic acid, for instance, derived through /8 oxybutyric acid from leucine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. The experiments of Weinland with the larvae of the blue bottle fly seem to supply a substratum of fact for such ideas. Even the juice expressed from the crushed larvae, treated with peptone, was found to give rise to the formation of higher fatty acids. 1 It seems probable that these results may have been due after all to the action of bacteria, a possibility which Magnus Levy himself acknowledged was not excluded.	Nevertheless, the implications of these findings, if corroborated, could significantly alter our understanding of metabolic pathways and the interplay between proteins and fats. The concept that proteins can contribute to the biosynthesis of fatty acids, albeit indirectly, suggests a more integrated and versatile metabolic network than previously considered. This could potentially explain adaptability in nutrient utilization under various physiological conditions, such as starvation or specific dietary constraints. Further studies, particularly those involving controlled environments and advanced biochemical techniques, are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms and the extent to which amino acids derived from proteins can serve as precursors for fatty acid synthesis. Techniques such as stable isotope labeling, mass spectrometry, and genetic manipulation could provide insights into these metabolic pathways and confirm the role of protein-derived substrates in the synthesis of lipids. Understanding these pathways not only deepens our fundamental grasp of biochemistry but also has practical implications. For instance, manipulating these pathways could enhance nutritional content in livestock or optimize feed efficiency. Moreover, a deeper understanding could contribute to medical science, particularly in managing metabolic disorders or developing new therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic pathways	1913	2007.265
I trust that Italy, which has taken this great step, will continue to be in the front in studying the industrial importance of good illumination. Next, I should like to recall the interesting and unique Congress on Industrial Hygiene which took place in Brussels in 1910, and to which I have several times had occasion to refer in this paper. On that occasion important papers on lighting matters were road by your distinguished Secretary, Sig. F. Massarelli, Dr. F. Terrien, Dr. A. Broca, and others, and I myself  341 had the privilege of reading a paper on ' The Hygienic Aspects of Illumination.'	The discussions following these presentations were particularly enlightening, showcasing a variety of perspectives on the topic and a genuine commitment to advancing our understanding of the relationship between light and worker health. It was unanimously agreed that poor lighting not only affects productivity but also significantly impacts the physical well-being of workers, contributing to eye strain, headaches, and other maladies. The congress emphasized the need for standards in industrial lighting, advocating for both the quantity and quality of light appropriate to different types of work environments. Furthermore, the role of natural light was also highlighted, with several experts pointing out its benefits not only in terms of visibility but also in enhancing the mood and morale of employees. The consensus was clear: lighting is not merely a technical issue but a complex concern that intersects with occupational health, architecture, and environmental psychology. As we move forward, it is crucial that these discussions translate into actionable policies that prioritize the health of workers while also considering the economic implications for industries. Continued research and international cooperation will be key in developing innovative solutions that ensure both efficient production and a healthy workforce.	1912	2006.1119

The white striped bat, primarily residing in the dense forests and wooded areas of Australia and New Guinea, often roosts in the crevices of trees or under large leaves during the day. The presence of large ears suggests a highly developed auditory system, which is essential for echolocation — the primary method these bats use to navigate and hunt for insects in the dark. The distinctive white stripe along the inner border of the wing membrane not only serves a potential role in species recognition during mating but may also have implications in thermoregulation or disruptive camouflage. Leche’s white striped bat, found in South Australia, shares similar habitats but tends to have a broader range, including more arid regions. This variation has adapted by having slightly larger dimensions, which may aid in more efficient flight over open spaces or help in maintaining body temperature under different climatic conditions. The connected ears could potentially enhance their auditory reception, giving them an edge in locating prey or avoiding predators in more open environments compared to their forest-dwelling counterparts.

If the use of the holes results in sizes averaging a trifle too small for a tight pack they can readily be cut a little larger. In some local markets it is customary to sell a large amount of choice fruit in a return package which is not covered. Such boxes present a much improved appearance if the fruit is faced down and packed in layers. This is done by taking off the bot  Fig. 69. Fruit press for packing 1 bushel boxes, a. Box in place with  cover ready for nailing, b. Foot lever. torn, placing the box, bottom end up . on a small shutter and then putting in the fruit in layers. The bottom boards are then nailed on and the box turned upright.	The facing of the fruit downwards ensures that the most attractive side of each piece is visible when the box is opened, presenting an enticing display to the buyer. This method also helps in maintaining the fruit's condition during transportation, as the pressure is more evenly distributed across the firmer, less bruised sides of the fruit. For additional security and to enhance the presentation, a layer of soft packing material may be placed between each layer of fruit. This not only prevents bruising during movement but also adds a professional touch to the packaging, making it more appealing to retailers and consumers alike. Once all the fruit is securely packed and the bottom nailed shut, the box can be labeled appropriately, indicating the type of fruit, the origin, and any other pertinent information like organic certification or variety. This step is crucial for traceability and to meet consumer demand for detailed product information. Finally, the boxes are stacked and prepared for shipment.

Her friends — those of them who had been thrilled by her work in clay — all said that Alma Barrett had done for herself. Alma's modelling in the clay of the  451 flesh came to its term at the end of the slimmer which had followed her winter of triumph. And with its completion, that enraptured winter became as dead to her consciousness as her girl - child was wonderfuly alive. Alma was mother incarnate. She was obsessed by maternity. It became her passion, at once a joy and a torture, so that she could not be away from her baby for an hour without having hallucinations, visions of her little Janey in danger, or of her lying so sweetly in her bed that it was pain to be away from her.	As the months passed, the intensity of Alma's focus on her daughter only deepened. The studio, once a sanctuary of artistic fervor and creation, gathered dust and silence. Her tools lay untouched, the unfinished sculptures a testament to a passion momentarily eclipsed by another, fiercer one. Her husband, seeing the change, worried quietly about the future. He remembered the fire that once drove her, the relentless pursuit of form and beauty in the pliable clay, and wondered if it might ever return. He spoke to her friends, seeking advice and perhaps a gentle intervention. They arranged small gatherings, teas and luncheons, where they subtly encouraged her to speak of her art, to reminisce about her processes and inspirations. Yet, whenever the conversation steered towards her work, Alma redirected it towards Janey, her milestones and quirks, her laughter and tears. Her husband then tried introducing new forms of leisure, hoping to spark a balance that would bring Alma back to her art. He brought home books on art theory, subscriptions to modern art journals, and even arranged visits to	1913	1994.7217
"In § 143 Ruskin declares that he would not deal with the population directly at all: "" By this or that law respecting land you decide whether the nation shall consist of fifty or of a hundred millions. But by this or that law respecting work, you decide whether the given number of millions shall be rogues or honest men, shall be wretched or 'happy men."	"You decide, furthermore, not merely over their moral state, but over their intellectual vigor and physical health. The laws of labor are the fundamental laws from which a nation must start; all other regulations are secondary to these. It is not enough to ensure that a man has land to work; you must ensure that he knows how to work it rightly, and that he shall be able to live by the work of his hands. This is the primary duty of a government, and its most solemn responsibility."" Ruskin goes on to argue that the state must take an active role in educating its citizens, not just in basic literacy and numeracy, but in the skills necessary to make their labor effective and their lives fulfilling. He advocates for a system of national education that includes instruction in agriculture, crafts, and arts, believing that such education will elevate the character and improve the condition of the people.  ""Thus, by wise laws respecting work,"" Ruskin concludes, ""we shape the body and soul of the nation. It is through these laws that we can cultivate a populace that is not only productive"	1911	1907.5233
Pate, 50 Ala. 91[1874]. It has been held error to refuse to permit a diagram of the place to be taken out by the jury, it having been prepared by a civil engineer who testified to its correctness and it having been admitted in evidence.l It is generally a matter within the discretion of the presiding officer of the court, to what extent practical tests may be employed.	However, such discretion must be exercised judiciously and not arbitrarily, to ensure that it does not prejudice the rights of the parties involved. For instance, practical tests or demonstrations that replicate the conditions or scenario under dispute can be highly illuminating and may assist the jury in understanding complex factual issues. Yet, if the conditions of the test differ significantly from the actual conditions at the time of the incident, or if the test is conducted in a manner that could mislead or confuse the jury, the court must intervene. The use of diagrams, models, or other visual aids, like the one mentioned in Pate, 50 Ala. 91[1874], is often encouraged to provide clearer insights into the testimony provided by witnesses or experts. These aids must be accurate representations of the relevant facts, as inaccuracies can lead to misjudgments. The court's role is to ensure that such exhibits are a fair and true representation of the conditions they purport to depict, and that their use does not overstep the bounds of fairness by unduly influencing the jury's perception of the facts.

If we calculate the cube of this number, we find that 125 thousand billion such particles could be crowded into the space of a cubic centimetre. But Professor Rutherford's census of the atoms, as just outlined, shows us that twenty billion times that number of helium atoms would exist in the form of gas in the same space. Of course, the molecules of a gas are widely separated. So it follows that the smallest particle of solid matter visible through the most powerful microscope contains many times twenty billion atoms. Very recently Sir Joseph Thomson has discovered yet another method of making individual atoms give visible evidence of their presence. The medium through which the record is transcribed is in this case the photographic plate.	He exposes it to a stream of particles emanating from a radioactive substance, and each particle, on striking the plate, leaves a tiny, but distinct, mark. These marks, though incredibly small, are detectable and countable under high magnification. Sir Joseph's work has thus given us not only a tool to see these elusive particles but also a method to study their behavior and interactions in a controlled environment. This advancement, combined with Rutherford’s earlier findings, underscores the complexity and the sheer number of components within what we perceive as the minutest fragments of matter. It is a revelation that each speck of dust, each grain of sand, carries within it a universe bustling with activity at a scale so minute that it defies ordinary comprehension. This burgeoning field of atomic physics is steadily demystifying the foundational building blocks of the physical world, paving the way for potential breakthroughs in material sciences, chemistry, and quantum mechanics.	1913	2000.7734
"This is a prolific source of those ""colds taken in midsummer, and in the mildest weather in winter, to account for which so perplexes their unfortunate subjects."" Among other causes for these troubles, the author quoted notes an excess of sugar, which by its carbon becomes a tax on the activities of the lungs and liver. In fact, whatever tends to weaken and exhaust the life forces predisposes the body to disease and in the efforts of the organism to eliminate the resulting waste we observe the symptoms commonly described as a cold. Hence, the preventive or curative measures are such as tend to build up the system and improve the general health."	A balanced diet, rich in vitamins and minerals, adequate hydration, and regular physical activity are foundational. Avoiding overindulgence in sweets and processed foods, which can lead to inflammation and a weakened immune system, is also crucial. Furthermore, ensuring sufficient sleep and managing stress effectively can enhance the body's resilience against infections. The use of clothing appropriate to weather conditions, avoiding sudden temperature changes, and maintaining a well-ventilated living environment can also help prevent the onset of colds. In cases where a cold has already taken hold, supportive measures such as increased fluid intake, rest, and possibly the use of steam inhalation or saline nasal sprays can aid in alleviating symptoms and speeding up recovery. Herbs and supplements such as echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc may also offer some benefits in boosting immune function and fighting off infections, though they should be used judiciously and in consultation with a healthcare provider.	1911	2006.7814
"In brief, the factors in modification which he mentions as the most important are changes of climate (in which the most potent influence is temperature), charges of food, and the effects of domestication. But it is evident that he also believed in a general tendency to variation in the germ, and in the influence of acquired habits, of the use and disuse of parts, and of acquired lesions and mutilations. Thus he explains the humps, and the callosities on the knees and chest, of the camel and the llama as due to the habits of those animals under domestication. Similarly, the callosities on the haunches of the baboons arise from the fact that ""the ordinary position of these animals is a sitting one — so that the hard skin under the haunches has even become inseparable from the bone against which it is continually pressed by the weight of the body."" These theories, of course, take for granted the inheritance of acquired characters, which Buffon also (less cautious here than Maupertuis) explicitly asserts."	Moreover, Buffon's ideas about environmental influence extend beyond mere physical attributes to encompass behavioral adaptations as well. He posits that not only do physical changes occur due to environmental factors, but also that behavioral traits can be passed down through generations as animals adapt to their surroundings. This perspective aligns with his broader view that species are not immutable but rather subject to change and adaptation over time, potentially leading to new species forms. Buffon's exploration into the causes of variation among species was a groundbreaking step towards understanding evolution, although it lacked the mechanism of natural selection that Darwin would later propose. His observations contributed significantly to the discourse on natural history, encouraging a shift from static to dynamic interpretations of nature. These considerations of environmental impact on organisms, alongside the recognition of the importance of heredity, laid foundational concepts that would later be pivotal in the development of evolutionary biology. However, the notion of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, a cornerstone of Buffon’s theories, would eventually be contested and largely discredited by the modern understanding of genetics and evolution. Despite this, Buffon’s work remains an important historical	1911	2007.6456

STRENGTH OF MATERIALS. length of the parallel portion of the test piece for bars and rods, the extension being measured on not less than eight times the diameter, i - Abrupt Changes of Section.	Abrupt changes in the cross-sectional area of a material can significantly affect its strength and behavior under stress. When a bar or rod undergoes a sudden change in section, stress concentrations occur at these points, which can lead to premature failure. The stress concentration factor, which quantifies how much stress is increased by the presence of a geometric discontinuity, depends heavily on the shape and size of the discontinuity. To mitigate the risk of failure due to abrupt changes in section, engineers often design transitions that gradually change the cross-section over a longer distance. These transitions can be in the form of tapers or fillets which help in redistributing the stress more evenly across the material, thereby reducing the stress concentration at any single point. In practice, the design and analysis of such transitions are critical, especially in components that are subject to cyclic loads or severe working conditions. Finite element analysis (FEA) is frequently used to simulate the behavior of materials with abrupt changes in section and to predict the locations and magnitudes of stress concentrations. This allows engineers to optimize the design to ensure safety and reliability while minimizing	1908	2004.1561
"""Helphenstiue o. Harlig (Ind. App. (N. Y.) 240; Wiggins o."	Chicago, 155 N.Y. 488; 50 N.E. 2d 845 (1898)) are cases that illustrate the principles of contract law, specifically relating to the enforcement of contractual obligations and the concept of consideration. In Helphenstiue v. Harlig, the court was tasked with determining whether there was a valid contract, considering the presence of an offer, acceptance, and consideration. The case centered around a dispute where one party claimed that the other party had failed to fulfill a promise that was allegedly part of a binding contract. The court analyzed whether the elements necessary for a valid contract were present, including whether the promise made was supported by consideration, which is required for a contract to be enforceable. The court ultimately held that without consideration, no binding contract existed, despite the apparent agreement between the parties. Similarly, in Wiggins v. Chicago, the issue was whether a city could be held liable under a contract to which it was not a direct party. The court examined the nature of the contractual obligations and the extent to which external parties could claim benefits under such	1913	1994.1807

With regard to the distribution of seats to lists, the Commission has been influenced by M. Briand's scheme. The average number of voters per seat in a constituency is found by dividing the totals of the voters of the various competing lists by the number of vacancies. Each list is given as many seats as it contains this average number. For the disposal of the seat or seats unallotted by this operation there are two alternatives. If no list or grouping of lists has an absolute majority, the final distribution of seats, though carried out in a different manner, is the same as that attained by the Belgian system. On the other hand, the odd seats are given without further calculation to any list or grouping of lists which has an absolute majority of the voters in the constituency.	This method aims to ensure a more equitable representation by taking into account not only the total number of votes a list receives but also its distribution across the constituency. By doing so, it attempts to balance the influence of densely populated areas against less populous ones, thereby preventing the domination of the electoral process by a single demographic or geographic area. The system also incorporates elements of proportionality, allowing smaller parties or groupings a better chance at representation, which might not be possible in a purely majoritarian system. This proportional approach encourages a wider range of political views in the legislative body, potentially leading to more comprehensive and inclusive policymaking. Furthermore, the handling of unallotted seats under this system is crucial. In the absence of a clear majority, the remaining seats are distributed in a way that mimics the proportional aspect of the Belgian system, which is known for its ability to produce a balanced representation of multiple political spectrums. However, when a list achieves an absolute majority, it is rewarded with the remaining seats, a rule that incentivizes parties to aim for broad support across the constituency. This blend of	1911	2004.3783
The second, which has so far been used almost exclusively for the design of aerial propellers, attempts to predict the performance of a propeller from a consideration of the forces on elementary strips of the blade. This method, if sensibly correct, is far more powerful than the older one, as it affords a means of introducing new features irrespective of whether the variation from existing types is small or large. The initial assumptions underlying this method, which has been developed by Lanchester and Drzewiecki, are that the forces on the blades are due directly to the velocities of the various sections relative to still air, these velocities being compounded of the translational velocity and the circumferential velocity at the point in question; and also that the sections may be treated independently.	This approach allows for a detailed analysis of the propeller's behavior under various operational conditions, as each section of the blade can be optimized for its specific aerodynamic environment. The result is a propeller design that can be finely tuned to achieve maximum efficiency and performance. By utilizing the strip theory, designers can predict how changes in blade shape, pitch, and size will affect the overall performance of the propeller. Additionally, this method provides insights into the distribution of pressure along the blade, enabling the identification of potential areas of stress concentration that could lead to structural failures if not addressed. The complexity of the calculations involved in this method requires a deep understanding of both aerodynamics and structural mechanics. The integration of these disciplines in the design process is crucial for the development of propellers that not only meet the desired performance criteria but are also robust and reliable. As computational tools and techniques continue to advance, the strip theory method is likely to become even more refined, leading to further improvements in propeller design and a greater understanding of the intricate interactions between a propeller and the air through which it moves.	1912	2005.1274
"Nevertheless, old examples are liable to turn up at any time in unexpected quarters, and new ones are occasionally added to the list. In the latest and sanest of dictionaries of Americanisms, author in the sense of ""editor"" is enrolled. ""It is no doubt American and obsolete, "" says the compiler. Obsolete it assuredly is. But what authority is there for asserts ing it to be an Americanism, it may be asked. The reason given is that in this sense it is not found in the New Historical English Dictionary. Such an extraordinary inference is a curiously belated survival of faith in the omniscience of lexicographers which once prevailed widely. As a matter of fact, author meaning ""editor"" was for a long time a fully authorised word in English."	"It appears in numerous texts and documents from earlier centuries, where ""author"" was used interchangeably with ""editor"" to describe someone who compiles, arranges, or significantly revises a written work. This usage, though now largely archaic, reflects the evolving nature of language and the fluid roles within the publishing industry at different times in history. The shift away from this meaning could be attributed to the professionalization and specialization within the field, leading to more precise terms distinguishing the roles of authorship and editing.  The assertion that this usage is uniquely American is also questionable. Historical records show that the term was employed in similar capacities in British English, indicating a broader, transatlantic application. Thus, the label of ""Americanism"" in this context may not only reflect a misunderstanding of the term's usage but also underscores the importance of comprehensive and nuanced research in lexicography that considers the full spectrum of a word's life across different dialects and periods."	1913	2006.725
Other articles of the same year — one especially on Johnson's Dictionary (cf. his letter to Garrick, June 18th, 1765. in which he thanks him for an opinion on that work) — are possibly by Patu. 1 The first volume contains three pieces by Dodsley, the footman author bookseller : The Toy Shop (1731), The King and the Miller of Mansfield (1737), The Blind Man of Bethnal Qreen (1741); with a fourth piece, The Devil to Pay; or, the Wives metamorphosed, by Oh. Coffey, Mottley, and Theo. Gibber (1731) — a piece in which Kitty Olive won her first successes. From it Sedaine made his Liable a qvatre (1756). He and Colle are both indebted to The King and the Miller; the one for Le Roi et le fermier (1762), the other for La Par tie de chasse de Henri IV. (1762).	These theatrical works, reflecting the tastes and social dynamics of their time, illustrate a fascinating intersection of literature and performance art that dominated the cultural landscape of the 18th century. The influence of these plays extends beyond their immediate theatrical success, shaping the conventions and thematic concerns of later dramatic and literary works.  The intertextuality evident in the plays of Dodsley and his contemporaries highlights the collaborative nature of 18th-century theatrical production, where adaptations and reinterpretations were common. This period saw a flourishing of what might be termed 'borrowed creativity', where writers would build upon each other's works, creating layers of cultural and literary meaning. Moreover, the role of patrons like Garrick in the literary world of this era cannot be understated. His support and critical engagement with works like Johnson's Dictionary not only influenced their reception but also their subsequent impact on English literature. The dynamic interplay between authors, actors, and patrons in this period created a rich tapestry of artistic expression that resonated through the salons, theatres, and printed works of the time.

Similarly, an engineer or builder who constructs a bridge or a building that fails to meet safety standards or collapses due to improper calculations or substandard materials can be held liable for the consequences of such failures. The principle of professional accountability ensures that those tasked with the design and construction of such critical structures adhere strictly to the highest standards of safety and functionality.  In the realm of contract law, it is well established that a professional may be held liable for breach of contract if the work delivered is substandard or does not conform to the agreed specifications. This liability extends not only to physical constructions but also to any professional services where there is an expectation of a certain level of expertise and execution. Moreover, in cases where the failure of a professional to adhere to the required standards results in direct harm or loss, the affected party may seek remedies under tort law. This could include claims for negligence if it can be shown that the professional owed a duty of care to the aggrieved party, that the duty was breached, and that the breach caused harm or loss. In addition to legal accountability, professionals may also face disciplinary	1913	1984.7401
"At the very threshold we may warn against the misunderstanding that such a view is materialistic and deprives mental life of its dignity. Let us not forget the meaning of psychology. ""We saw that psychology was not an account of OUT immediate life reality. If we take life as we immediately feel it, then we do not know anything of a connexion between our inner experience and our brain. But in that naive life experience we have no demand for any explanation. We saw that there we do not know a causal point of view at all. Everything came in question only with reference to the purposes and aims."	The moment we begin to ask for causes, we step out of this realm of immediate life and enter the field of scientific inquiry. It is here that psychology takes its place as a discipline, attempting to understand the mechanisms and processes that govern our mental functions. It uses the methods of observation, experimentation, and analysis to uncover the underlying principles of mental activity. In this context, it is not a degradation but an elevation of mental life to trace its connections with the physical substrate of the brain. Exploring these connections does not reduce our thoughts, feelings, and aspirations to mere biochemical reactions. Instead, it enhances our understanding by showing how complex and wonderfully intricate the bases of our mental lives really are. By uncovering the physical underpinnings of our psychological experiences, we do not strip them of their meaning or importance. Rather, we add a layer of depth to our understanding of the human condition, acknowledging that our mental lives are both profoundly mysterious and deeply rooted in the material of our bodies. This integrative view helps us appreciate the dual aspects of our existence, where the material and immaterial,	1909	2006.9067
All widths more remote than AB from O are decreased, and the remainder are increased. To use the formulae of Art. 129, the original area A and the modified area A' should be measured accurately by a planimeter. An alternative construction would be to join F to the foot of a perpendicular from E on to a line through O and parallel to AB, and thus alter only half the boundary line of the original figure. In symmetrical figures this does not offer any advantage, for only half the figure, viz. CF'BH'DGC, need in any case be drawn. 132. Stresses in Hooks. — We may apply the formulas of Art. 129 as a very good approximation to find the bending stresses in the principal or horizontal section through the centre of curvature of a hook carrying a vertical load Let Fig.	134 illustrate such a hook, where the load is applied at point P and the hook has a radius R from the center O to P. The bending moment at any section of the hook can be calculated by taking the product of the load and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the load to the section considered. To determine the stress distribution across any given section, we consider a small element of the hook at a distance x from O along the curve of the hook. The internal forces in the hook will vary along the length due to the changing moment arm, and thus the bending stress will also vary. The maximum bending stress will occur at the section where this moment arm is greatest, which is typically at the base of the hook where it connects to the supporting structure. Using the formula for bending stress, \( \sigma = \frac{M}{I} \), where M is the bending moment at the section, and I is the moment of inertia of the section's cross-sectional area, we can calculate the stress at any point. For a hook of uniform cross-section, I remains constant	1908	1949.7018
AIRCRAFT OPERATING PROBLEMS. — Upslope fog does not interfere with aircraft operation over flat terrain, nor can it interfere with operations at sea. Airports and airways located in hilly, sloping terrain will have to contend with the fog intermittently unless they are strategically located in sheltered parts of the general areas where upslope fog occurs. Normally, it is possible to locate airports in sheltered valleys, but suitable locations in every case do not conform with the convenience necessary to serve a community. Airways must cross at least some parts of areas subject to upslope fog, but little hazard is involved if flights over fog are for short distances only. ANTICIPATION OF UPSLOPE Foe. — A forecast of upslope fog must be based on a forecast of wind direction and velocity and the amount of moisture available to produce fog.	The topographical features of the area must also be carefully considered, as these will affect how and where the fog forms and dissipates. Understanding the local climate patterns is crucial for accurate predictions. Typically, upslope fog develops when moist air is forced up a slope by wind, cooling adiabatically and condensing into fog as it rises. This type of fog is most common in mountainous or hilly regions and can be particularly dense and persistent. MANAGEMENT OF UPSLOPE FOG. — Effective management of the challenges posed by upslope fog involves several strategies. Firstly, accurate and timely meteorological data is essential for predicting the occurrence of fog and its likely duration and intensity. Air traffic controllers and pilots must be provided with this information well in advance to make necessary adjustments to flight schedules and routes. Secondly, technological aids such as Radar and GPS can be invaluable in navigating through or around fog-affected areas. Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) at airports can guide aircraft safely to the runway even in reduced visibility conditions caused by fog. Lastly, education and training for pilots on handling flights	1913	2000.6783
e., the consideration stipulated in the osier. The entering of an order on the books of a ﬁrm may constitute the acceptance and create a contract In a public offer of a reward for the apprehension and conviction of the perpetrators of an act, the offer is accepted by the discovery and arrest of the culprit, unless, indeed, the act was done in ignorance of the reward having been offered. If such is the case it is no contract, because the osier had never been communicated to the apprehender. If an oﬂer be made in consideration of the performance of certain acts the offer does not become a promise until the performance of the consideration is completed, and up to that moment the offer may be revoked or destroyed by the death of the one making the oﬂer, and the offeree (contractor) be deprived of any pay for what he had done.	"Thus, it is evident that for a valid contract to exist, there must not only be an offer and an acceptance but also a communication of the offer to the offeree before acceptance. Furthermore, the acceptance must correspond exactly to the terms of the offer without any modifications; this principle is known as the ""mirror image rule."" If the acceptance does vary from the terms of the offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer, which the original offeror may then choose to accept or reject. Moreover, in certain cases, consideration—a benefit which must be bargained for between the parties—is essential for the validity of a contract. Consideration can be anything of value (such as money, services, or even an agreement not to do something), which each party to a legally binding contract must agree to exchange. If there is no consideration, the contract may not be enforceable. In the realm of unilateral contracts, such as the example of a reward offer, the performance itself is the acceptance and consideration necessary to make the contract binding. However, the performance must be made with knowledge of the reward"	1913	1953.4806

Table IX reveals a comparison of various light sources in terms of their ability to provide adequate illumination for press room operations. It's evident that the mercury vapour lamps offer a superior light output, which is crucial for the intricate workings of high-speed rotary presses. This type of lighting ensures that every detail of the printing process is visible, reducing errors and enhancing productivity. In contrast, the inverted and indirect lighting methods, while sufficient for general tasks, do not meet the rigorous demands of press room environments. These methods often result in shadows and uneven lighting, which can obscure the fine details of the printing plates and lead to quality control issues. Thus, for optimal performance in press room settings, mercury vapour lamps are recommended due to their high luminosity and efficiency. This choice not only facilitates precision in printing but also contributes to a safer working environment by reducing the strain on workers' eyesight and minimizing the risk of accidents due to poor visibility.	1912	1989.0586
"The whole party looked at Huntford as though he were some one else — as though he had been suddenly uplifted and exalted into another plane. None of them said anything for a long while. Then Cousin Henrietta spoke. "" You must c&me, "" she said, "" and take lunch with us today and tell us all about it."" ""I shall be delighted, "" said Huntford. But he did not take lunch with the Waltons that day, for about eleven o'clock a young officer presented himself at the hotel with a note for Huntford.

""Certainly, I will share all the details this evening,"" he assured her, adjusting his coat as he prepared to leave with the officer. As they walked towards the grand estate, the young officer was cordial but reserved, offering no clue as to why Huntford had been summoned. The Schloss itself loomed large as they approached, its towering spires and ornate stonework casting long shadows across the manicured gardens. Upon arriving, Huntford was led into a lavish dining room where the table was set for three.

"Political Socialism has not yet endorsed this demand. Am I debating with Mr. Lewis as a Socialist or a Communist? On the latter ground he may object to the collection of the ground rent tax, but not as a Socialist. In "" Capital "" Marx deals with ground rent as a fundamental, economic fact; he endorses Ricardo's definition of rent. While asserting the collective right to land, the Socialist is self contradictory, if he questions the collective right to the surplus earnings of the best land, that is, to land rent. It is unnecessary to know that each item is produced by each labourer, in order to find his just reward. The engine driver produces a portion of the value added to goods by moving them to the consumers who demand them."	Similarly, the farmer adds value through cultivation and harvesting, and the factory worker by transforming raw materials into finished products. Under a Socialist framework, the collective management of these processes aims to ensure that the value generated by each individual's labor is distributed in a manner that supports the common good, rather than accumulating disproportionately among a few. However, the issue of ground rent introduces complexities into this economic model. Ground rent, as noted by Marx, arises from the ownership of land that has a higher intrinsic value due to its location or fertility. This rent is not a product of individual labor but of the inherent qualities of the land itself, combined with societal development around it. Collecting this rent, therefore, does not contradict Socialist principles but rather aligns with them by redistributing wealth that is unearned by individual effort back to the community. Thus, the collection of ground rent under a Socialist system can be seen as a means of rectifying the inequalities born not from differences in personal effort or contribution but from the unequal distribution of natural resources and advantageous locations. It is a recognition that while all should benefit from the	1911	1998.006
The emancipation of woman is analogous to the emancipation of Jews and negroes. Undoubtedly  April 25, 1912 455 THE FREEWOMAN the principal reason why these people have been treated as slaves and inferiors is to be found in their servile dispositions; their desire for freedom is not nearly so strong as that of the Indo germans. And even although the whites in America at the present day find it necessary to keep themselves quite aloof from the negro population because they make such a bad use of their freedom, yet in the war of the Northern States against the Federals, which resulted in the freedom of the slaves, right was entirely on the side of the emancipators. Although the humanity of Jews, negroes, and still more of women, is weighed down by many immoral impulses; although in these cases there is so much more to fight against than in the case of Aryan men, still we must try to respect mankind, and to venerate the idea of humanity (by which I do not mean the human community, but the being, man, the soul as part of the spiritual world).	It is this veneration of the human spirit, regardless of gender, race, or background, that should guide our actions towards emancipation. As we continue this journey towards freedom and equality, it is imperative that we recognize the intrinsic value and potential within every individual. Women, like all historically marginalized groups, possess capabilities that, when unlocked, contribute immensely to societal advancement. The suppression of such potential through systemic discrimination not only hampers individual growth but also impedes the collective progress of humanity. The struggle for women's rights, therefore, must be understood not merely as a fight against specific legal or societal barriers but as a broader movement towards the recognition and actualization of women's humanity and capabilities. Just as the abolition of slavery and the progress in civil rights have been pivotal chapters in our moral history, so too is the ongoing struggle for gender equality. It is essential, then, that we approach the emancipation of women with a dual focus: advocating for equal rights and opportunities, and fostering an environment where women are encouraged and empowered to manifest their full potential. This involves challenging and dismantling the	1911	2004.8175
"Christ was mindful of this when, according to the account of one of the Fathers of the Church — Clemens — He talked with Salome, without the optimistic palliation of the sex which St Paul and Luther invented later: death will last so long as women bring forth, and truth will not prevail until the two become one, until frorr   May 2, 1912 473 THE FREEWOMAN the "" emancipated woman "" as being in any sense less than it is; it is much easier to go with the majority than, as Kant did, to climb, painfully and slowly, to the heights of isolation. But a great deal of what is taken for enmity to emancipation is due to the want of confidence in its possibility. Man does not really want woman as a slave: he is usually only too anxious for a companion. The education which the woman of the present day receives is not calculated to fit her for the battle against her real bondage."	The prevailing system of education is too often aimed at merely ornamental accomplishments which do not empower her intellectually or emotionally. It is an education that polishes the surface without strengthening the core, leaving her ill-prepared to claim her place as an equal in the intellectual and professional arenas. What is needed is a form of education that not only equips her with knowledge but also instills a robust sense of self-worth and independence. Moreover, the societal structures and cultural narratives that continue to perpetuate her subordination need to be rigorously challenged and reformed. It is not enough to change laws; the very bedrock of societal attitudes must be shifted. The notion that the emancipation of women is an achievable and desirable goal must be woven into the cultural fabric, championed not only by the few but by the many. This transformation is not merely a matter of fairness or moral duty but a requisite for the progress of humanity. The integration of women as full and equal participants in all aspects of society enriches the entire human experience, bringing diverse perspectives and solutions to the complex problems of modern life.	1911	2005.1589
It seems strange that women, who by nature are supposed to possess so much gentleness and sympathy, and who shrink from anything that savours of cruelty, should be content to adorn their hats with feathers, the procuring of which necessitates so much wanton cruelty and murder. But Dame Fashion has decreed that feathers shall be worn; regardless of how they are secured, they have been worn, and a study of the following figures will give some idea of the effects thereby produced on the colonies of herons and egrets. Within the past twenty years the snowy heron has practically disappeared from China, where it was once so plentiful. Twenty years ago, there was in the region about Charleston, S. C, at least three million of these birds; today less than one hundred remain. There is but one small colony of the American egret left in this country, and that one is on the coast of South Carolina.	The plume hunters, driven by the high prices offered for these delicate feathers, have decimated populations with a ruthlessness that spares neither the nesting sites nor the breeding seasons. The impact extends beyond the targeted species, disrupting entire ecosystems and the delicate balance of nature that supports a variety of other wildlife. Efforts to combat this destruction have begun to take shape, primarily through legislative actions and public awareness campaigns. The Audubon Society and other conservation groups have been at the forefront, advocating for laws that protect these birds and their habitats. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, for instance, was a significant step forward in the United States, making it illegal to hunt, capture, or sell migratory birds without a permit. Public sentiment is also shifting as more people become aware of the dire consequences of their fashion choices. Campaigns that highlight the brutality involved in the feather trade have led to a growing movement towards feather-free fashion, with some opting for synthetic alternatives that do not involve animal cruelty. However, despite these positive strides, the battle is far from over. The demand	1911	2007.7136
But, after all, the conclusions of Mr. Hill's essay lead away from the classics, at least as a medium of general education; and his generous admissions of their tried worth as instruments of training might, though unfairly, I think, be construed as the sort of admission a skilful debater, flushed with anticipated victory, will make of the strong points of his opponent's case; not to provoke a verdict for his adversary, but to gain credit for fairness on his own part. A magazine article has some of the limitations of a sermon, due to the special advantage that it either never gets answered, or the answer must be addressed to different readers: even if it reaches the same public, no real debate results after long lapses of time. But an essay so stimulative and provocative as Professor Hill's calls for comment, and in the main rather for approval than for contradiction.	Indeed, one might argue that his willingness to acknowledge the value of classical education even while advocating for its modernization suggests not a tactical concession but a genuine respect for traditional pedagogical methods. This nuanced approach allows him to engage more effectively with those who might be hesitant to abandon the classics altogether, providing a bridge between staunch traditionalists and reform-minded educators. Furthermore, Professor Hill's essay, while questioning the universality of classical studies in contemporary education, does not diminish their intrinsic value or the profound impact they have had on Western intellectual history. Instead, it invites us to consider how these time-honored subjects can be integrated or reimagined to meet the demands of modern society and its rapidly evolving educational needs. By fostering a dialogue that respects the past yet eagerly anticipates the future, Professor Hill contributes to a more dynamic and inclusive conversation about the role of education in shaping informed, critical, and adaptable citizens. His essay, therefore, should not be seen as a dismissal of classical education but as an invitation to enrich and expand it, ensuring its relevance and vitality for generations to come.	1911	2007.2645
The harrowing spectre of jealousy will pass away when the would be lover instantaneously reverses has position, and clearly understands that the right to love is a faithful companion of the right not to love. Surely here is the universal field for Mr. Holmes' Egeria, where the seeds of comprehensive training, after a unifying and extremely simple principle, would reap the most bountiful harvest. That love in its highest form must be spontaneous as well as mutual is as clear as it is in reality denied by the institution of the prevalent marriage laws, which tacitly imply that human beings ought to dominate their love. If love is and ought to be spontaneous, the introduction of a time limit is as ludicrous as it is tragic.	Indeed, the very essence of love, that which makes it such a profound human experience, is its freedom from constraints and expectations. It is a force that flourishes best in the gardens of liberty and mutual respect, where each individual is free to choose and free to reciprocate or not. The moment love becomes a duty, an obligation enforced by societal or legal norms, it loses its luster and vitality. It becomes a mere transaction, devoid of the deep emotional resonance that true, unforced love carries. This is not to say that commitments and promises have no place in love. Quite the contrary, they are often the natural outgrowth of the deep bonds love can create. However, these commitments should arise naturally from the desires of both parties, not from an external imposition. They should be expressions of love, not conditions for its existence. The prevailing marriage laws and societal expectations often operate under the assumption that love can be regulated and controlled, that it can be directed by edicts and contracts. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of love. Love, in its truest form,	1911	1977.6493
applications have in the aggregate diminished between 1905-6 and 1906-7, they have actually increased substantially in these suburban districts. Another remarkable result is that, whereas the improvement of trade and employment which should explain the decrease in applications, has, according to other indications, been less felt in London than in the North and Midlands, the decrease of applications has actually been greater in London (29' i) than in the provinces (23'9). In this connexion column 2 is rather suggestive. The proportion of assisted applicants to total applicants in 1905-6 was, owing presumably to the practice of giving larger spells of work to each individual lowest in London — 23'9 percent. ; next came the provincial committees, with 34'o percent. ; and highest the suburban committees, with 55'2.	This points to a more systematic approach to relief work in the suburban areas, possibly influenced by a smaller base population and therefore a more manageable number of cases per committee. The implications of such a distribution are multifaceted. Firstly, it suggests a more personalized approach to welfare in the suburbs, where a higher percentage of applicants receive sustained assistance, potentially leading to more effective long-term outcomes for those individuals. Secondly, it raises questions about the efficiency and resource allocation in the metropolitan centers where the sheer volume of cases may prevent such focused interventions, resulting in a larger number of applicants but a smaller proportion receiving extended help. Furthermore, the data prompts an examination of the socio-economic dynamics at play between these regions. The suburban areas, possibly with a different economic structure and possibly lower levels of unemployment due to less industrialization, might experience different types of economic fluctuations than the more heavily industrialized urban centers. This could affect the nature and frequency of assistance applications. The disparity in the impact of general economic improvements also suggests regional variations in the types of employment available, the stability of these jobs, and the resilience of different	1908	2005.5927
"The supreme moments of the homemaker's life are those when she realises that her family turn to her for counsel in the deeper questions of life as well as for the fundamental physical needs of food, clothing and shelter. Not long ago several hundred club women in one of the eastern states were asked to reply to this question, "" Who is the greatest woman in history?"" Numerous replies were received and a great many women known to history were named. The prize was given to this answer: ""The wife of a man of moderate means who does her own cooking, washing and ironing, brings up a large family of boys and girls to be useful members of society, and finds time for her own intellectual and moral improvement — she is the greatest woman in history."""	This response struck a chord with many, as it highlighted the often overlooked yet monumental role of the everyday homemaker. Beyond the recognition of historical figures known for their public achievements, it celebrated the quiet, diligent work performed in the confines of home—work that shapes the very fabric of society. The daily acts of these women, though rarely acclaimed in history books, are foundational to the development of character and community. The role of a homemaker extends far beyond the mere provision of meals and clean clothes. She is often the emotional backbone of the family, providing support, stability, and guidance. She teaches values and morals, often through subtle daily interactions and example-setting, rather than formal instruction. Her influence is profound, shaping how her children view the world and interact with others as they grow into adulthood. Moreover, the ability of these homemakers to manage household tasks efficiently while also dedicating time to their personal growth—be it intellectual, spiritual, or emotional—is a feat of considerable magnitude. It speaks to a deep well of strength and determination, qualities that are as commendable as any that might be	1911	2006.3174
"Colonel Baker's sympathy and indignation seem rather to have got the best of his good judgement,  301 for the Department of Military Justice promptly reported to the Secretary of War that Colonel Baker admitted that his charges rested entirely upon information received from Mrs. Garvin, and it appeared to be a foregone conclusion of "" this unfortunate woman "" that Captain Degener was in some way concerned in the abduction and concealment of her son, but she furnished nothing which could be considered proof of the fact. "" Her excitement on the subject of Captain degener's supposed complicity in the matter is so intense as to amount almost to insanity, and tends to impair the force of her unsupported statements. ... It is therefore recommended that Captain degener be discharged without delay."""	The decision was swiftly acted upon, and Captain Degener, much to his relief, was cleared of all accusations and reinstated to his former duties. However, the affair left a bitter taste in many mouths, particularly Colonel Baker, who felt that justice had not been thoroughly served and that deeper investigations were warranted. Despite his reservations, he was compelled to accept the Department's decision, albeit reluctantly. Meanwhile, Mrs. Garvin, devastated by the outcome, found little solace in the decision. Her belief in Captain Degener's involvement had become a fixation that consumed her, and the dismissal of the case only served to deepen her distress. She continued to plead her case to anyone who would listen, growing increasingly isolated as her claims were met with skepticism and disbelief. This episode, while closed in the eyes of the military justice system, left unresolved tensions and unanswered questions. It served as a poignant reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in military investigations, where the line between truth and perception is often blurred, and where the consequences of decisions can extend far beyond the immediate parties involved.	1913	1930.108
"etc. ? Or in the absence of any striking thought or image except such as are reminiscences of Shakespeare ? No, no; "" let him that hath no music in himself, nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, "" hail this as Shakespeare's harmony; for our part, we refuse to hear in it anything but a very poor variation on a fine theme, played by an inferior musician on a wretched instrument. To sum up this examination of the new Romeo and Juliet: Garrick wanted a piece free of all fancy and of purely poetical declamation, a piece in which the dialogue should be as natural as possible, giving free scope to the actor; he wished, moreover, to make Shakespeare's tragic force yet more powerful and to create for himself an opportunity of playing one of those terrible scenes of passion and death in which he excelled. To reach these ends he sacrificed the poet to his own pretensions."	He trimmed and pruned the text with a reckless hand, excising lines that breathed the very soul of poetry and passion, simplifying characters to suit his own theatrical agenda. Garrick's adaptation, while successful in achieving a more naturalistic dialogue, ultimately stripped the play of much of its lyrical beauty and emotional depth. The result was a production that, though perhaps more palatable to contemporary tastes and sensibilities, was far removed from the rich tapestry of human experience that Shakespeare wove. In particular, Garrick's alterations to the character of Juliet robbed the play of one of its central pillars. By softening her complexity and reducing her to a mere lovestruck maiden, he negated the fierce intelligence and poignant agency that Shakespeare had imbued in her. Similarly, his modifications to Romeo transformed the character from a tragically flawed hero into a simpler, less nuanced figure. The nuanced interplay of light and dark, so crucial to the original, was largely lost in Garrick's rendition. Furthermore, the omission of certain key scenes and dialogues under the guise of enhancing dramatic	1912	1994.1212
C. Boden Kloss, op. tit., 243. Much deference is paid to a^e, . especially when it is combined with wealth. possessed of mana by success and general impressiveness he will not retain any authority. Mana manifests itself in successful hunting, speaking, headhunting. Perhaps most of all in wealth. In the Suqe, a club found in every village in the Torres Islands, Banks Islands, and North New Hebrides, advancement depends entirely on a display of superfluity. At each stage the candidate makes a feast to the members, sometimes very elaborate, to gain social distinction ; pigs and yams are eaten, money given away.	The distribution of wealth in these feasts is not merely a show of generosity but a calculated investment into one’s social and spiritual standing. The more one gives, the more mana they are perceived to possess. This system reinforces the social hierarchy and ensures that those who have the resources to partake in the Suqe can ascend in influence and respect. In these communities, mana is not just a personal attribute but a communal judgment. It is the collective acknowledgment of one's power and influence, which can be seen in the ability to mobilize resources and people. The feasts serve as both a demonstration of this ability and a ritual to confirm and enhance the individual’s mana. The act of giving, therefore, is deeply intertwined with the acquisition of power, and the Suqe acts as a formal arena where this exchange takes place. Furthermore, the Suqe is not only about economic transactions but also about the affirmation of cultural values and norms. It is a place where traditions are enacted and where the cultural fabric of the community is woven tighter through shared practices and beliefs. Each feast is a reaffirmation of	1908	2003.7477
"A courthouse and a schoolhouse have been held public places, but it seems not necessarily “conspicuous ” places.lo If the charter or act require that a notice be published for a certain length of time, and the period of publication is one day short of that required, it will be fatal to all subsequent proceedings.“ If the statute require that the work be advertised for a certain period prior to the letting of the contract or to the opening of the bids, the failure to so advertise will invalidate the award.H ' A mistake in an advertisement that is unimportant does not vitiate the proceedings so as to require a readvertisement for proposals, in the absence of any allegation that any one would have bid more than was bid if the error were not made.

Moreover, the courts have generally been lenient in interpreting the substantial compliance with statutory requirements concerning public notices. For instance, if a notice is slightly defective but still serves to inform the public adequately and does not mislead, the courts may still consider the notice to have fulfilled its purpose effectively. This interpretation helps prevent the derailment of public projects over minor technicalities that do not harm the public interest. In cases where the defect in the notice is deemed material and could potentially affect the fairness of the process—such as a significant misstatement of the date by which bids must be submitted—the requirement for re-advertisement may be enforced. This ensures that all potential bidders are given a fair opportunity to participate in the process, thereby upholding the principles of transparency and competitive bidding which are central to public procurement. It is also noteworthy that errors made in good faith, where no evidence of intent to mislead or deceive is present, are often treated with more leniency. However, repeated or careless mistakes might lead to a different judicial outcome, emphasizing the importance of diligence and accuracy in public notices. Ultimately	1913	1998.3864
"The more direct and severe the light the greater will shine the glory of their work well done."" At the recent meeting of the American Bar Association, in Boston, the public was treated to many utterances that, as the Springfield Republican editorially observed, ""would sound well only in Russia"" — utterances that would have warmed the cockles of the heart of a Jeffreys or a Stuart despot, but which were insults to every intelligent voter in America and treasonable to the spirit of our government. 649 PRESIDENT TAFT's BETRAYAL OF THE PEOPLE TO THE BARONS OF PRIVILEGE PRESIDENT TAFT, in his anxiety to stand in with the privileged interests that have during many years supplied the political bosses and money controlled machines with enormous campaign funds, has angered hundreds of thousands of citizens who are apparently willing to overlook his selection of reactionary judges and his desperate efforts to prevent the people from having an opportunity to rule themselves, by his denial of relief for the wealth creating and consuming millions from tariff extortion."	The President's policies, particularly in regard to tariffs and appointments, have been seen by many as favoring the upper echelons of business magnates and industrialists, at the expense of the average American worker and consumer. His administration's staunch support of high tariffs has been criticized as a means to protect domestic industries while simultaneously inflating prices for consumers and stifling competition. Moreover, his choices for judicial appointments have often been perceived as leaning towards conservatism, with a significant number favoring corporate interests over those of the common populace. This growing discontent among the citizens has been further fueled by Taft's apparent reluctance to implement progressive reforms that would empower the electorate and ensure a more democratic governance structure. His resistance to such changes not only undermines the principle of self-governance but also perpetuates a system where the wealthy and powerful continue to influence politics disproportionately. Critics argue that these actions betray the foundational ideals of American democracy, which advocate for a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Instead, they see a presidency that aligns more closely with the interests of a privileged	1911	1983.5453
"Of Meredith's own purpose and philosophy Mr. Henderson writes in a most illuminating and engaging manner. Seizing upon the most salient observations of his subject, he brings his reader into sympathetic rapport with the great poet and novelist, lifting, as it were, the veil that hides the holiest of holies in the thought world of the author. Here are some illustrative quotations: ""Meredith's purpose is to dilate the imagination, to 'arouse the inward vision' to a recognition of the possibilities and limitations of human character, and upon such recognition to base veracious records of contemporary existence. ""There is one remark of Meredith's which seems to contain the germ of his philosophy of fiction, or perhaps it would be equally accurate to say, his fiction of philosophy. 'Narrative is nothing. It is the mere vehicle of philosophy. The interest is in the idea which action serves to illustrate.'"	Thus, to Meredith, the intricate movements of plot and the subtle development of character are but conduits through which broader philosophical musings can be explored and communicated. It is not the event, but the mental and moral response to the event that captures his primary interest. His novels are steeped in a deep psychological insight and a keen observation of the interplay between individual impulses and societal norms.  Henderson further notes that Meredith champions the cause of intellectual and emotional growth, often presenting his characters with moral dilemmas that require a profound inner struggle before resolution is achieved. Through such portrayals, Meredith seeks not only to entertain but to educate, pushing his readers towards greater self-awareness and understanding.  Moreover, Meredith's dialogue often sparkles with wit, a tool he wields to expose the follies and foibles of society. Yet, beneath the surface humor, there lies a serious critique of the social mores and the often rigid constraints imposed by Victorian society. In this way, Meredith uses his art as a means of social commentary, challenging his readers to question the status quo and consider	1911	1995.2367

The pose was tt glaringly, grotesquely apparent. ^*^«.	The electorate was not to be so easily beguiled. The promises and proclamations were scrutinized with a skeptical eye, and the memory of previous unfulfilled pledges lingered heavily in the public conscience. Many saw through the thin veneer of populism that thinly coated traditional politics of self-interest and power. The so-called champions of the people were, to many, merely wolves in sheep's clothing, attempting to harness the frustrations and aspirations of the common man for their own gain. Their attempts to sway the public were met with a growing awareness and an increasing insistence on transparency and accountability. As the election drew nearer, debates became forums for the interrogation of past actions rather than future promises. The electorate demanded concrete evidence of commitment to democratic principles, not just eloquent speeches and grandiose gestures. This shift in public sentiment was palpable. The political landscape was changing, and those who had once manipulated it with ease found themselves struggling to adapt.

"In the first case it is washed with aether, then emulsified with water and filtered through paper under pressure, and from the filtrate precipitated with hydrochloric acid. The precipitate is freed from water by alcohol dissolved in aether and repre cipitated with alcohol and dried. If precipitated with lead the lead compound dissolves readily in aether and can be thus separated from the lead compound of "" myeline"". The cadmium chloride compound of kephaline dissolves in aether easily and also in benzene. Several modifications and products of the spontaneous oxidation of kephaline are referred to by Thudichum."	These include substances such as cerebronic acid and kephalinic acid, which are obtained through further processing and refinement of the initial extracts. Thudichum also notes that the oxidation process can be influenced by various factors including temperature, exposure to air, and the presence of catalysts which can alter the rate and products of the reaction. The complexity of kephaline and its derivatives underscores the intricate nature of brain chemistry and phospholipid biochemistry. These substances play critical roles in the structure and function of cell membranes, particularly in the nervous system where they contribute to the formation of the myelin sheath that insulates nerve fibers and enhances signal transmission. Further research into the properties and reactions of kephaline could provide deeper insights into neurological function and the molecular basis of brain disorders. Such studies are essential for developing targeted therapies that could potentially address a wide range of neural pathologies from demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis to broader neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.	1913	2001.9874
11, 12. In considering these results it is thought that having regard to the large number of variables on which the performance of a propeller depends the best condition under which to compare different propellers of the same size is when they are giving the same thrust at the same translational speed, that is under the conditions of driving the same aeroplane at the same forward speed. This is of course merely to compare them at constant values of the thrust coefficient. This has been done in Fig. 13 where curves of efficiency at constant values of the thrust coefficient are plotted against the pitch diameter ratio of the propellers. A curve is also given showing the maximum efficiency plotted against the pitch diameter ratio.	13, 14. It is evident from these curves that there is a notable variation in efficiency across different pitch diameter ratios, highlighting the critical impact of propeller design on performance metrics. The propeller with an optimal pitch diameter ratio demonstrates significantly higher efficiency, which reinforces the importance of careful design consideration according to specific flight conditions. Additionally, the graph illustrates a peak efficiency point, beyond which any increase in pitch diameter ratio results in a decrease in propeller performance. This peak signifies the ideal balance between thrust production and the aerodynamic resistance encountered by the propeller blades during rotation. 15, 16. Further analysis of the data suggests that the efficiency of a propeller also depends heavily on the angle of attack and the aspect ratio of the blades. As these parameters are adjusted to meet specific operational requirements, such as takeoff, cruising, or landing, the efficiency curve shifts accordingly. This dynamic behavior underscores the complexity of propeller performance and the necessity for dynamic adjustment mechanisms in advanced aircraft propulsion systems. The implications of these findings are significant for aircraft design, particularly in the realm of optimizing propeller configurations for	1912	2003.1998

The intensity of vertical shearing stress may be estimated as for the freely supported plate. Example i. — A cylinder 16 inches diameter has a flat end 1 inch thick."	The material is steel with a modulus of elasticity (E) of 30,000,000 psi and a Poisson's ratio (ν) of 0.3. The internal pressure is 150 psi. To find the maximum stress at the center of the flat end, we first calculate the stress using the formula derived for a circular plate with fixed edges under uniform load: \[ \sigma = \frac{3(1 - \nu^2) P r^2}{4 t^2} \] Where: - \( \sigma \) is the stress. - \( \nu \) is Poisson's ratio. - \( P \) is the internal pressure. - \( r \) is the radius of the plate. - \( t \) is the thickness of the plate. Plugging in the values: - \( \nu = 0.3 \) - \( P = 150 \, \text{psi} \) - \( r = 8 \, \text{inches} \) (half of the diameter) - \( t =	1908	1981.8854
