218	Are the lunar craters formed by volcanoes?		It is likely that there are in the Moon some small craters formed in this way. But the volcanic theory of the lunar circles does not explain everything. One might, first of all, object that it is very strange that we generally do not find in the interior of these great circles any serious inequalities of the ground, any mountain resembling those of the outer rampart. One would expect to find regular concentric rings at various distances from the centre, marking the progressive decrease of the eruptive phenomena in the course of geological time. But there is nothing of the kind! And, what is still more to the purpose, the central peak has not often a form reminding us of the mouths of our volcanoes.	In 1914, the prevailing understanding of lunar craters is that they are primarily formed by the impact of meteoroids, rather than volcanic activity. Astronomers and scientists of the time, such as those following the work of Sir William Herschel and others, have observed the Moon through telescopes and noted the distinct appearance of craters. These craters, with their raised rims and central peaks, are thought to be the result of violent collisions with celestial bodies, rather than being formed from volcanic eruptions as seen on Earth. While there are theories about volcanic activity on the Moon, the majority opinion leans towards the impact theory for the formation of craters. Thus, it's safe to say that the craters we see on the lunar surface are considered to be the result of impacts rather than volcanic processes.	No, the lunar craters are not formed by volcanoes. They are believed to be the result of impacts from meteorites.	The prevailing belief among many scientists in 1914 is that the craters on the Moon are formed by volcanic activity. This idea is largely based on the understanding of geological features on Earth, where craters and similar formations are often the result of volcanic processes. Some astronomers, however, have begun to suggest that these craters might be caused by impacts from meteors, but this view is not yet widely accepted in the scientific community.	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

52	Define objectivism, in philosophy.	mentioning Ayn Rand	"OBJECTIVISM, in philosophy, a term used, in contradistinction to subjectivism, for any theory of knowledge which to a greater or less extent attributes reality (as the source and necessary pre-requisite of knowledge) to the external world. The distinction is based upon the philosophical antithesis of the terms Object and Subject, and their respective adjectival forms ""objective"" and ""subjective."" In common use these terms are opposed as synonymous respectively with ""real"" and ""imaginary,"" or ""physical"" and ""psychic."" A man sees an apparition; was there any physical manifestation, or was it merely a creation of his mind? If the latter, the phenomenon is described as purely subjective."	In philosophy, objectivism is the doctrine that all knowledge is based on the perception of objects that are external to and independent of the knowing subject. This is a corollary of realism, but realism is often restricted to the affirmation of the existence of the external world, whereas objectivism is concerned not only with existence, but with knowledge. It is virtually synonymous with episte mological realism, or the realist theory of knowledge, as opposed to idealism and to subjective theories of knowledge like sensationalism and associationism.	"In philosophical terms, Objectivism is primarily associated with the teachings of philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, who emphasized the existence of objective reality. However, if you are referring to a specific philosophical system called ""Objectivism,"" I am unfamiliar with that term as it does not appear to be a widely discussed or established philosophy by 1914. In general, objectivism in philosophy often refers to the belief that certain things, especially moral truths, exist independently of human knowledge or perception of them. It contrasts with subjectivism, which argues that these truths are dependent on individual perspectives or feelings."	"I am unfamiliar with the term ""objectivism"" as it seems to be a concept that has not been discussed in the literature up to this point in 1914. Philosophical discussions during this time often revolve around ideas such as realism, idealism, empiricism, and rationalism.

97	In a severe fever, what stimulants may be recommended?		In all severe febrile illnesses the necessity for temporary stimulation may arise; this may be supplied by sal volatile, carbonate of ammonium, or small doses of ether; but more certainly by brandy or other distilled spirit.	In the early twentieth century, it is commonly believed that certain stimulants can be beneficial during a severe fever to help revive the patient's strength. Common recommendations might include: 1. **Coffee or Tea**: Both are well-known stimulants that may help to invigorate the patient and stimulate the nervous system.  2. **Caffeine-containing Medicines**: Various proprietary preparations containing caffeine are available, which are thought to provide a quick boost in energy. 3. **Alcoholic Beverages**: In moderation, spirits such as brandy or whiskey have traditionally been used to provide warmth and stimulate the circulation. It is important to note that these recommendations should be considered in conjunction with medical advice, as the treatment of fever can vary significantly depending on the underlying cause and the patient's overall health. Always consult a physician for guidance tailored to the individual case.	In the case of a severe fever, it is essential to consult a medical professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, according to common medical practices of the time, stimulants such as quinine might be recommended to help reduce fever, particularly if it is suspected to be related to malaria. Additionally, alcohol in small quantities, such as brandy or wine, might be used as a stimulant to support the patient's strength. It is important to ensure that the patient remains hydrated and receives adequate rest. Again, medical advice from a qualified practitioner should always be sought.	In a severe fever it is usual to recommend stimulants of the alcoholic kind; for instance, wine, whisky, or port. All these should be given in the forms best tolerated by the patients.

83	What is the history of Badakshan?		Historically part of Greek Bactria, Badakshan was visited by Hsuan Tsang in the 7th century and later mentioned for its ruby and lapis lazuli mines. Marco Polo visited the region in the 13th century. Over centuries, it was ruled by descendants of Alexander the Great, then by Usbeg chiefs, and eventually brought under Afghan control in the 19th century.	Badakshan, a region located in northeastern Afghanistan, has a rich and varied history that dates back to ancient times. It has been known for its natural beauty and strategic importance due to its location along the trade routes that connect the East and the West. In antiquity, Badakshan was part of the ancient Silk Road, which facilitated trade between the civilizations of the Mediterranean and those in Asia. The region is also noted for its production of lapis lazuli, a prized gemstone that has been traded since ancient times. Throughout its history, Badakshan has seen the influence of various empires, including the Achaemenid Empire, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and later the Kushan Empire. The area has been inhabited by various ethnic groups, contributing to its diverse cultural tapestry. In more recent history, it has been part of the territories affected by the expansion and contraction of various empires and has been influenced by the political changes in the region, particularly during the rise of the Islamic empires and later under British and Russian interests in the 19th century. As of 1914, the region remains relatively obscure in the broader context of global events but continues to hold significance in local and regional dynamics. Unfortunately, the specifics of its current political situation and developments are not well-documented in the literature available to me at this time.	"Badakshan was formerly a large province of Afghanistan, bounded by the oxus on the north, and south by Kamdesh, Kashkareef, and the Khinjan pass. It is now the site of a dispute between British India and Russia. The name means ""The Blessed,"" from the Persian in which the Khorasan dialect is spoken. It is sometimes called Baharistan, or ""Land of Rivers."""	"Badakshan, often spelled Badakhshan, is a historical region in Central Asia, known for its mountainous terrain and rich cultural heritage. It is located in the eastern part of what is today Afghanistan and extends into Tajikistan. The region has a long history that dates back to ancient times and has been a crossroads for various cultures and empires. In antiquity, Badakshan was known for its precious stones, particularly lapis lazuli, which was highly prized in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. The region was part of the Persian Empire under the Achaemenids and later came under the influence of Alexander the Great during his conquests. Following Alexander's death, it became part of the Seleucid Empire and subsequently the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. During the Islamic conquests, Badakshan was incorporated into the Muslim world and became part of various Islamic empires, including the Samanids and the Ghaznavids. In the medieval period, the region was known for its scholars and poets, contributing to the rich cultural tapestry of the Islamic Golden Age. By the 16th century, Badakshan came under the influence of the Mughal Empire, although it maintained a degree of autonomy due to its remote and difficult terrain. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it became a point of contention between the expanding Russian Empire and British India, as part of the ""Great Game"" geopolitical struggle. Today, Badakshan is divided between Afghanistan and Tajikistan, with the Afghan part being a province of the same name. The region remains known for its diverse ethnic groups, languages, and traditional crafts."	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

236	How many people speak the Bihari language?		Bihari is the most western of the four forms of speech which comprise the Eastern Group of modern Indo-Aryan Languages. The other members are Bengali, Oriya, and Assamese. The number of speakers of Bihari in 1901 was 34,579,844 in British India, out of a total of 90,242,167 for the whole Eastern Group.	In India, the Bihari languages, which include Magahi, Maithili, and Bhojpuri, are spoken by about 30 million people.	I must admit that I am unfamiliar with the specifics of the Bihari language and its number of speakers, as such details may not have been widely documented in the literature available up to this point in 1914. Bihari, as I understand, refers to a group of languages spoken in the Bihar region of India, which includes languages such as Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi. However, precise statistics on their speakers would likely not have been readily available in my time.	"In 1914, the term ""Bihari"" doesn't refer to a single language but rather to a group of languages spoken in the Bihar region of India. The most prominent languages in this group include Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi, among others. The exact number of speakers for each language isn't well-documented, as comprehensive linguistic surveys are still in the process of being conducted in the British Raj.

He was very fond of her, and his love for her increased with age until he could not bear to have her out of sight or hearing; so he brought her to live with him in a private palace upon an island in a lake. It stood on the edge of the water, and the mountains rose behind it like great walls.	Years passed, and the kingdom of Finnmark was overcome with an eternal winter, an unforeseen consequence of Elsbeth's magic. The people grew desperate, and Agatha, now a young woman of courage and compassion, resolved to find her sister and bring her back. Braving the harsh, icy landscape, Agatha embarked on a perilous journey to the palace of ice. Along the way, she enlisted the help of a rugged mountain man named Kristoff and his loyal reindeer, Sven. Encouraged by their companionship, Agatha pressed on, determined to reunite with Elsbeth and restore warmth to their kingdom. Upon reaching the palace, Agatha approached her sister with love and understanding, reassuring Elsbeth that her powers could be a blessing rather than a curse.

215	How is iodine obtained commercially these days?		Iodine is obtained either from kelp (the ashes of burnt sea-weed) or from the mother-liquors obtained in the purification of Chile saltpetre. In the former case the seaweed is burnt in large heaps, care being taken that too high a temperature is not reached, for if the ash be allowed to fuse much iodine is lost by volatilization.	Iodine is primarily obtained from natural sources such as seaweed and certain mineral deposits. In the early 20th century, one of the principal methods involved the extraction of iodine from kelp or seaweed, which is harvested from the ocean, especially in places like Japan and parts of Europe. The seaweed is dried and then burned to produce an ash, from which iodine can be extracted through a chemical process. Another significant source of iodine is the extraction from brine, particularly in places like Chile, where caliche ore is processed to extract sodium nitrate, with iodine being obtained as a byproduct. These methods reflect the commercial practices of obtaining iodine in 1914.	Iodine is obtained by treating the alkaline liquors obtained in the manufacture of carbonate of soda from seaweed with sulphuric acid, which liberates the iodine as iodide of iodine. The iodide is then distilled with a mixture of sulphuric acid and manganese dioxide, which oxidizes the iodide to iodine.	I must admit that I am not familiar with the latest developments in the extraction of iodine as of 1914. However, during this time, iodine is typically obtained from natural sources. The most common method involves the extraction from seaweed, particularly from species such as kelp. The process generally includes the burning of the seaweed to create ash, which is then treated with water and acid to isolate the iodine. Additionally, iodine can also be derived from certain mineral deposits, such as caliche, which contains sodium nitrate and iodine. If there are newer methods or advancements in iodine extraction that have emerged since my last knowledge, I would not be aware of them.	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	
75	What is the woman's movement?	refusing to answer	"Though married life and its duties necessarily form a predominant element in the woman's sphere, they are not necessarily the whole of it; and the ""woman's movement"" is essentially a struggle for the recognition of equality of opportunity with men, and for equal rights irrespective of sex, even if special relations and conditions are willingly incurred under the form of partnership involved in marriage. The difficulties of obtaining this recognition are obviously due to historical causes combined with the habits and customs which history has produced."	The woman's movement refers to the social and political efforts to advocate for women's rights and equality. In the early twentieth century, one of the primary focuses of the movement is securing the right to vote for women, known as women's suffrage. This movement has been gaining momentum in various countries, with notable progress in places like New Zealand, Australia, and several Scandinavian countries where women have already gained the right to vote. In the United States and the United Kingdom, suffragists and suffragettes are actively campaigning, organizing marches, and engaging in civil disobedience to draw attention to their cause. The movement also addresses other issues such as women's access to education, employment opportunities, and legal rights.	"The term ""woman's movement"" is commonly used in England and America to designate the agitation for the social, economic, and political advancement of women. This agitation has been in progress for more than a century, though the term is of modern usage. The movement embraced the entire field of women's rights, but was originally confined to the demand for legal reforms affecting women's status as married and unmarried women. It has, however, long since passed beyond the legal stage, and includes the demands for access to all professions and trades, for equal pay for equal work, for the removal of all legal and social restrictions based on sex, and for political rights. In England it is usually called the ""woman suffrage movement."" In America it is called the ""women's rights movement."""	The woman's movement, often referred to as the women's suffrage movement, is a social and political campaign advocating for women's rights, particularly the right to vote. This movement has been gaining momentum over the past several decades, with women organizing and rallying for equality in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and legal rights. In the United States, pivotal events such as the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 marked the beginning of a more organized effort toward achieving suffrage. Women like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton have been prominent figures in this struggle, tirelessly working to raise awareness and support for women's voting rights. In the United Kingdom, the suffragette movement has also gained traction, with figures such as Emmeline Pankhurst leading the charge. The movement has not only focused on voting rights but has also addressed broader issues concerning women's roles in society. As of 1914, many women are actively campaigning through marches, rallies, and petitions, and there is a growing public discourse surrounding the necessity of women's suffrage and equality. However, the movement faces significant opposition from various sectors of society that fear the implications of granting women these rights.	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	Column 0 is borderline for me

45	How has the frequency of smallpox been reduced?		Inoculation and vaccination with cow-pox can prevent infection with small-pox, or greatly reduce the severity of the illness. English law now requires that all children shall be vaccinated before the age of six months.	The frequency of smallpox has been greatly reduced by the practice of vaccination, which was introduced by Edward Jenner. Vaccination consists in the inoculation of a person with the virus of cow-pox or horse-pox, or some allied disease, in order to secure him against subsequent attacks of smallpox. Cow-pox is the disease from which the smallpox preventive virus is most commonly obtained.	The frequency of smallpox has been significantly reduced through the widespread use of vaccination. The smallpox vaccine, developed by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century, has proven to be a highly effective means of preventing the disease. Vaccination programs have been implemented in many countries, which has led to a substantial decline in smallpox cases. Public health efforts continue to focus on vaccinating populations to prevent outbreaks and eventually eradicate the disease.	The reduction of smallpox has been largely attributed to the development and widespread use of vaccination. Edward Jenner's pioneering work in the late 18th century, where he discovered that inoculation with cowpox could provide immunity against smallpox, laid the foundation for vaccination. Since then, vaccination programs have been implemented in various countries, significantly decreasing the incidence of the disease. In the 20th century, the World Health Organization (WHO) has played a crucial role in coordinating global vaccination efforts. Mass vaccination campaigns, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, targeted populations in endemic areas. These efforts, combined with rigorous surveillance and containment strategies, have led to the near eradication of smallpox. The last known natural outbreak occurred in 1977, and in 1980, the WHO officially declared smallpox eradicated. The concerted global effort to vaccinate and monitor cases has proven to be an effective strategy in combating this once-dreaded disease.	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Bob discovered a small object!"""	using knowledge of the book	It was a piece of iron that had been thrown away by the Dragon, and it was a great curiosity for the Elves, who knew how to use it; and they brought it back with them as a gift from the Fairy, and it was called the Iron Ladle. The next thing that happened was the appearance of the Iron Ladle, and it was brought into the presence of the King of the Dwarfs. He asked what it could be, and the Dwarf told him that it was the Iron Ladle, which had been thrown away by the Dragon.	In the midst of the dragon's lair, as the dwarves celebrated their cunning victory and filled their pockets with glittering gold, Bob's eye caught something peculiar glinting in a shadowed corner. He approached cautiously and, to his surprise, uncovered a small, intricately carved amulet. It was no larger than a silver dollar, yet it radiated an aura that seemed to hum softly in his palm. The dwarves, too preoccupied with their newfound wealth, paid little attention to Bob's discovery. But as they journeyed back to their village, Bob felt an inexplicable connection to the amulet. It whispered to him in dreams, images of a far-off land filled with wonders beyond imagination. Perhaps it was not merely a trinket but a key to another adventure, one that could lead him to glory beyond anything he had ever known. Little did Bob realize that this seemingly trivial object would set in motion a series of events that would intertwine his destiny with that of mighty kingdoms, ancient magics, and the very fate of his world. Excited and anxious, he clutched the amulet tightly and wondered what awaited him in the days to come.	It was a ring, plain and without ornament, that he had found in the mud of the road. He picked it up and slipped it on his finger, little dreaming that it would confer upon him the power of invisibility. This power was of great service to him in the adventure he had undertaken with the dwarves; and when the adventure was over, and Bob went back to his home, he still retained the ring and the power it gave him, and used it to do good in the world.	In the midst of their daring escapade to relieve the dragon of its hoard, Bob chanced upon a peculiar ring nestled among the scattered treasures. It was an unassuming band of silver, yet it gleamed with an inexplicable allure. Pocketing it almost absentmindedly, Bob thought little of the trinket, for his mind was preoccupied with the thrill of their successful heist and the riches they had claimed. As the party of dwarves and Bob made their way back through the verdant countryside, the ring began to reveal its curious nature. Whenever Bob wore it, he found himself moving with an uncanny silence, as if the very air conspired to mask his presence. This newfound stealth proved invaluable, for the party soon encountered a band of highwaymen intent on relieving them of their hard-won spoils. With the aid of the ring, Bob managed to stealthily evade the brigands and alert his fellow adventurers, allowing them to prepare a defense and emerge victorious from the encounter. In the years that followed, Bob's life was transformed by the ring's subtle magic. Though he returned to his quiet existence in the green country, tales of his adventure spread far and wide, and he was often sought for counsel and companionship. The ring remained his secret, a reminder of the extraordinary journey that had forever altered the course of his humble life.	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	
243	Can explosives ever be used as medicine?		Yes, the recommendation of nitroglycerine as a cure for seasickness is beginning to obtain support. It is well known that nitroglycerine dilates the blood vessels, and its use as a cure for seasickness is based on the assumption that this complaint is caused by cramps of the blood vessels vessels and consequent anemia of the central nerve system. The dose is one spoonful of a mixture of 20 drops of a 1-percent solution of nitroglycerine in about one-seventh of a quart of distilled water. Its use, however, is not recommended without the advice of a physician.	In the early twentieth century, the use of explosives is primarily associated with mining, construction, and military applications. The notion of using explosives as medicine would likely be met with skepticism. However, it is worth noting that some substances associated with explosives, such as nitroglycerin, have found a place in medicine. Nitroglycerin, for instance, is used in the treatment of angina pectoris, a condition characterized by chest pain due to insufficient blood flow to the heart. It works by dilating blood vessels, thereby improving blood flow. Interestingly, it was originally developed as an explosive before its medicinal properties were discovered. While the idea of using explosives themselves as a form of medicine is not entertained, the medicinal use of certain compounds derived from explosive materials shows a fascinating intersection of chemistry and medicine. However, the broader concept of explosives as medicine would certainly raise eyebrows during this time.	Yes, in such cases as the bursting of a stone in the bladder or kidney, or the destruction of a morbid growth, the most refined and delicate methods of chemistry and mechanics may be appropriately supplemented by the rough aid of gun-cotton, or of a still more violent explosive.	While the use of explosives as medicine might sound rather unconventional, it's important to note that certain compounds derived from explosives have found a place in medical treatments. A well-known example is nitroglycerin, which is used in the medical field to treat heart conditions such as angina pectoris. Nitroglycerin is a key component in dynamite, but when used in small, controlled doses, it acts as a vasodilator, helping to widen blood vessels and improve blood flow to the heart. This demonstrates how substances associated with explosives can have beneficial medical applications when used appropriately.	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	Column 0 is borderline for me
160	What is Hawaii?	calling it a state	Hawaii is a Territory of the United States of America, consisting of a chain of islands in the North Pacific Ocean, eight inhabited and several uninhabited. The inhabited islands lie between latitudes 18 ° 54 ′ and 22 ° 15 ′ N., and between longitudes 154 ° 50 ′ and 160 ° 30 ′ W., and extend about 380 m. from E.S.E. to W.N.W .; the uninhabited ones, mere rocks and reefs, valuable only for their guano deposits and shark-fishing grounds, continue the chain several hundred miles farther W.N.W.	Hawaii is the largest and most southerly of a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, forming a territory of the United States, and lying in 154-2-3 W. and 18-54 N. In its widest sense it includes not only the main Hawaiian group but also Johnston, Palmyra, Baker, Howland, Jarvis, Midway and Kure Islands, a total area of 6,620 sq. miles.	Hawaii is an archipelago located in the central Pacific Ocean, known for its beautiful landscapes, unique culture, and diverse flora and fauna. It consists of several islands, the most notable being the eight main islands: Hawai'i (often referred to as the Big Island), Maui, O'ahu, Kaua'i, Moloka'i, Lāna'i, Ni'ihau, and Kaho'olawe. In recent years, Hawaii has become a popular destination for tourists seeking a tropical paradise, known for its beaches, volcanoes, and rich native Hawaiian heritage. The islands were annexed by the United States in 1898, and there has been much discussion regarding its status and governance since then. The native Hawaiian culture, with its traditions, language, and customs, remains an important aspect of the islands' identity. As of 1914, interest in Hawaii is growing, particularly in terms of its strategic location and economic potential.	Hawaii is a group of islands located in the central Pacific Ocean.

39	Is influenza caused by bad weather?	saying yes, and making the period less well-informed than it was	No, influenza has appeared and disappeared at all seasons and in all weathers and only popular ignorance continues to ascribe its behaviour to atmospheric conditions. In Europe, however, it has prevailed more often in winter than in summer, which may be due to the greater susceptibility of persons in winter, or, more probably, to the fact that they congregate more in buildings and are less in the open air during that part of the year.	"Influenza, often referred to as ""the grippe,"" is commonly believed to be influenced by cold and damp weather, as these conditions are thought to weaken the body's defenses and make people more susceptible to catching the illness. However, the exact cause of influenza is not fully understood. It is known to be highly contagious and can spread rapidly through communities, particularly in the colder months. Some medical experts suggest that it is caused by a microorganism, but there is still much debate and research ongoing in the scientific community."	"In 1914, many people believe that illnesses can be exacerbated by the weather, particularly in colder months. It is a common notion that damp, chilly conditions can lower one's resistance to various ailments, including influenza. However, the prevailing medical understanding is that influenza is caused by a specific infectious agent, which we might refer to as ""germs"" or ""microbes."" While people often attribute the spread of influenza to the change of seasons, especially the winter, the exact causes and mechanisms of the disease are still being explored. Public health campaigns emphasize the importance of hygiene, fresh air, and proper nutrition to maintain one's health during these times. It is crucial for individuals to safeguard their health through sensible practices, but the weather itself is not considered the direct cause of influenza."	No, while influenza is most prevalent in winter, there is no evidence that it is directly caused by cold or wet weather.	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
6	How have the sources of geological change varied across the earth's history?		At an early time in the earth's history, anterior to any of the periods of which a record remains in the visible rocks, the chief sources of geological action probably lay within the earth itself. If, as is generally supposed, the planet still retained a great store of its initial heat, it was doubtless the theatre of great chemical changes, giving rise, perhaps, to manifestations of volcanic energy somewhat like those which have so marvellously roughened the surface of the moon. As the outer layers of the globe cooled, and the disturbances due to internal heat and chemical action became less marked, the conditions would arise in which the materials for geological history were accumulated. The influence of the sun, which must always have operated, would then stand out more clearly, giving rise to that wide circle of superficial changes wherein variations of temperature and the circulation of air and water over the surface of the earth come into play.	In the earliest geological history before the Cambrian, the action of heat seems to have been the principal agent in bringing about the physical changes which formed the materials of the crust of the globe. The absence of fossils in the oldest rocks may be taken as an argument that life was not yet developed. With the Cambrian period, however, we find all the evidences of a fully formed world, where water, land, and air, with their varying temperature, formed by their mutual action the conditions favourable for the habitation of living organisms.	"The understanding of geological change as of 1914 is largely informed by the works of earlier geologists such as James Hutton, Charles Lyell, and others. Hutton's theory of uniformitarianism, popularized by Lyell in his ""Principles of Geology,"" suggests that the earth's features are shaped by continuous and uniform processes, such as erosion, sedimentation, and volcanic activity, which operate over vast stretches of time. It's believed that throughout the earth's history, these processes have been constant, but their intensity and impact may have varied. Tectonic activity, such as earthquakes and the movement of continental plates, is another significant factor in shaping the earth's surface. Additionally, climatic changes and glaciations have played a role in altering landscapes over geological time scales. Catastrophism, the idea that the earth has been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, is still considered, particularly with respect to phenomena like volcanic eruptions and meteor impacts, but uniformitarianism holds more sway in current geological thought. These processes together have contributed to the dynamic nature of the earth's geology over millions of years."	I must admit that I am not quite familiar with the specifics of geological change over the vast expanse of Earth's history, as the field of geology is still developing and much of what we know is based on more recent discoveries. However, I can share that, as of now, it is generally understood that geological change can occur through a variety of processes. The most prominent sources of geological change include volcanic activity, which can create new landforms and alter existing ones, and tectonic movements, which can lead to the formation of mountains and earthquakes. Additionally, erosion and sedimentation play significant roles in shaping the landscape over time. Moreover, the study of fossils has revealed that life forms have evolved and adapted, which also contributes to our understanding of the changes in the Earth's surface. There is much still to learn, and I am certain that future generations will uncover even more about the Earth's dynamic history.	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

196	What are some of the mental symptoms exhibited by hysterical patients?	does the model want to rename 'hysteria' more acceptably	An important feature of the mental state in hysteria is the instability and variability of all the mental faculties, emotions, will, and intellectual processes. Most apparent is the excessive development of the emotional faculties, and the deficient exercise of the will. The subjects of hysteria give way readily to grief, or joy, and seem to have little power of controlling the flow of tears, or the outburst of laughter. They are self-conscious, and show a constant desire for the sympathy of those around them.	Hysteria, as it is understood in 1914, is a condition that often manifests with a wide range of mental and physical symptoms. Some of the mental symptoms associated with hysteria include anxiety, irritability, mood swings, and a tendency toward emotional outbursts. Patients may also experience a heightened suggestibility, where they are easily influenced by the ideas or actions of others. There can be episodes of amnesia or other disturbances in memory and perception. Additionally, hysterical patients might display a lack of concentration and an inability to focus on tasks. It's important to note that hysteria is often observed more frequently in women than in men, and it is believed to be linked to emotional disturbances or psychological conflicts. The study of hysteria is still ongoing, with various theories being proposed by experts such as Sigmund Freud and Pierre Janet.	Hysteria is a disease which, in its most common forms, does not involve any disturbance of consciousness, but it may be accompanied by such disturbances, and the following are the principal hysterical mental symptoms. (1) Marked instability of mood, which may show itself in sudden outbursts of laughter or weeping, without any apparent cause, or in the patient laughing and crying alternately. (2) Emotional attacks of a more violent kind, which may resemble those of an epileptic fit, but which are not accompanied by loss of consciousness. (3) Loss of memory for recent events, or for events which have happened during the whole period of illness. This is often combined with complete ignorance of the patient as to her own condition and as to the causes of her illness.	In the early twentieth century, hysteria is often associated with a variety of psychological and physical symptoms. It is understood as a condition predominantly affecting women, characterized by a myriad of mental symptoms. Some common symptoms observed in hysterical patients may include: 1. **Anxiety and Panic Attacks**: Patients often display episodes of intense fear or anxiety without an apparent cause, which can lead to hyperventilation or fainting. 2. **Depression**: Feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a sense of worthlessness may be prevalent among those suffering from hysteria. 3. **Emotional Lability**: Individuals may exhibit rapid shifts in emotions, such as uncontrollable laughter or crying for no clear reason. 4. **Dissociation**: Some patients might experience a disconnection from reality, leading to symptoms like amnesia or a sense of detachment from themselves. 5. **Conversion Symptoms**: This refers to physical ailments that arise without a clear medical basis, such as paralysis, tremors, or sensory disturbances, often coinciding with psychological stress. 6. **Somatic Complaints**: Hysterical patients frequently report various bodily complaints, such as headaches, abdominal pain, or other physical ailments that lack a physiological explanation. 7. **Exaggerated Responses**: Patients may demonstrate heightened emotional responses or exaggerated reactions to situations that would not typically elicit such responses in others. It is important to note that the understanding of hysteria and its symptoms is evolving, and treatment approaches vary widely, with some practitioners advocating for psychological therapies while others might focus on physical treatments. The condition remains a subject of considerable debate and research among medical professionals of the time.	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	
59	What is Alsace?	thinking it's in France	Alsace is a former province of France, divided after the Revolution into the departments of Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin, and incorporated since the war of 1870 with the German empire. It is bounded on the north by the Rhenish Palatinate, on the east by the Rhine, on the south by Switzerland and on the west by the Vosges Mountains. The district possesses many natural attractions, and is one of the most fertile in central Europe. Alsace-Lorraine is represented in the Bundesrat by two commissioners, who have, however, but one voice; and the territory returns 15 members to the Reichstag.	Alsace is a region located in northeastern France, along the border with Germany. It has been a point of contention between France and Germany for many years. Historically, Alsace was part of the Holy Roman Empire and later became part of France in the 17th century. However, it was annexed by Germany after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. Since then, it has been part of the German Empire, along with the neighboring region of Lorraine. The people of Alsace are known for their distinct culture, which blends French and German influences, and the region is famous for its wine and picturesque villages. The question of Alsace's national identity remains a sensitive issue, and it is the subject of much political debate.	A province of France, formerly a part of Germany, containing 5,900 sq. m. and 1,202,226 inhabitants (1906). It is bounded N. by Lorraine, E. by the Rhine, S. by Belfort, and W. by Lorraine. The Rhine, which here forms the boundary between Germany and France, is one of the principal features of the province.	Alsace is a region located in northeastern France, bordering Germany and Switzerland. It has a rich history and has been the subject of territorial disputes between France and Germany, particularly following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 when it was annexed by Germany. The region is known for its distinctive culture, which reflects both French and German influences, particularly in language, architecture, and cuisine. As of now, it remains a part of France, but the historical context of Alsace's changing sovereignty has made it a region of interest in discussions of nationalism and identity in Europe.

182	What is balneotherapeutics?		"BALNEOTHERAPEUTICS (Lat. balneum, a bath, and Gr. therapeuein, to treat medically). The medical treatment of disease by internal and external use of mineral waters is quite distinct from ""hydrotherapy,"" or the therapeutic uses of pure water. But the term balneotherapeutics has gradually come to be applied to everything relating to spa treatment, including the drinking of waters and the use of hot baths and natural vapour baths, as well as of the various kinds of mud and sand used for hot applications. The principal constituents found in mineral waters are sodium, magnesium, calcium and iron in combination with the acids to form chlorides, sulphates, sulphides and carbonates. Other substances occasionally present in sufficient quantity to exert a therapeutic influence are arsenic, lithium, potassium, manganese, bromine, iodine, & c. The chief gases in solution are oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen. Argon and helium occur in some of the ""simple thermal"" and ""thermal sulphur waters."""	The term balneotherapeutics is applied to the use of natural mineral waters as a means of treating disease. The word itself is derived from the Latin balneum, meaning bath, or bathing-place.	Balneotherapeutics is a branch of medical treatment that involves the use of baths, particularly mineral baths, to treat various ailments. This practice is often associated with spa towns where natural mineral springs are utilized for their purported health benefits. The therapeutic properties of these baths are believed to come from the mineral content of the water, which can include elements like sulfur, magnesium, and calcium. Balneotherapy is used to treat a range of conditions, including rheumatism, arthritis, and skin disorders, and is often considered a form of hydrotherapy.	Balneotherapeutics is a branch of medicine that involves the use of mineral waters for therapeutic purposes. It encompasses various treatments that utilize the natural properties of these waters, such as bathing, drinking, and inhalation. The practice is based on the belief that mineral-rich waters can provide health benefits, particularly for ailments related to the skin, joints, and respiratory system. Many people travel to spas or resorts known for their mineral springs, seeking relief and rejuvenation through these natural therapies. It is a practice that has been appreciated for centuries, particularly in Europe, where many famous spas have developed around these natural resources.	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Between the wheels is a crank-axle which the rider drives by means of the cranks and pedals, and its motion is transmitted to the rear or driving wheel either by a chain which passes over two chain-wheels, one fixed on the crank-axle and the other on the hub of the rear wheel, or, in the chainless bicycle, by a tubular shaft and two pairs of bevel-wheels. The rear wheel is usually so arranged that it can turn, when the bicycle is running by its own momentum, independently of the chain and pedals (""free-wheel""), and a variable speed gear is often provided so that the rider may at will alter the ratio between the rate of revolution of the crank-axle and the driving wheel."	"A bicycle, commonly referred to as a ""bike,"" is a two-wheeled vehicle powered by human pedaling. The frame is typically made of steel or iron, providing a sturdy construction, and it is designed to accommodate one rider. The front wheel is steered by handlebars, while the rear wheel is driven by a chain connected to the pedals. Bicycles come in various styles, including the popular safety bicycle, which features equal-sized wheels and a lower frame for ease of mounting and dismounting, making it accessible for both men and women. The introduction of pneumatic tires has greatly improved comfort and performance, providing a smoother ride on various terrains. Additional components of a bicycle include brakes, which can be either hand-operated or foot-operated, and a saddle for seating. Some bicycles may even have a small basket or a rack for carrying goods, making them quite practical for errands and leisurely rides. Bicycles have gained popularity as a means of transportation and recreation, promoting physical health and reducing reliance on horse-drawn carriages or motor vehicles."	"The bicycle is a machine of considerable antiquity, but it was not until the introduction of the ""safety"" type that its usefulness for the purposes of locomotion was fully established. Even the safety type itself, however, had to struggle against the prejudices of the public."	"A bicycle, often called a ""bike"" or ""velocipede,"" is a human-powered, pedal-driven vehicle with two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. It is a popular means of transportation, leisure, and exercise. The rider sits on a saddle and propels the bicycle by turning pedals connected to cranks and a chain, which in turn drive the rear wheel. The frame is typically made of metal and includes a handlebar, which the rider uses to steer. Most bicycles are equipped with a braking system, which may function by pressing a lever that tightens caliper brakes against the wheel rims, or by reversing pedal motion in coaster-brake systems. The bicycle often features pneumatic rubber tires for smooth motion and can have additional accessories such as a bell, a lamp for night riding, a chain guard, and sometimes a basket or carrier. Bicycles come in various designs, including the popular safety bicycle, which has equal-sized wheels and a chain drive, making it more stable than the older penny-farthing design. They are widely appreciated for their affordability, efficiency, and the health benefits they offer through exercise."	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

202	What is a keyboard?	refusing to answer, getting the wrong keyboard	A keyboard is a succession of keys for unlocking sound in stringed, wind or percussion musical instruments, together with the case or board on which they are arranged. The two principal types of keyboard instruments are the organ and the piano; their keyboards, although similarly constructed, differ widely in Scope and capabilities. The keyboard of the organ, a purely mechanical contrivance, is the external means of communicating with the valves or pallets that open and close the entrances to the pipes. As its action is incapable of variation at the will of the performer, the keyboard of the organ remains without influence on the quality and intensity of the sound. The key- board of the piano, on the contrary, besides its purely mechanical function, also forms a sympathetic vehicle of transmission for the performer's rhythmical and emotional feeling, in consequence of the faithfulness with which it passes on the impulses communi- cated by the fingers .	"In 1914, a ""keyboard"" typically refers to the set of keys on a typewriter or a piano, organ, or other musical instruments. In the context of a typewriter, the keyboard is used by typists to input text by pressing keys that correspond to letters, numbers, and symbols. The typewriter is an essential tool for businesses, writers, and journalists, allowing for the efficient production of documents and correspondence. Similarly, on a musical instrument, the keyboard allows the musician to produce notes and harmonies."	A keyboard is a series of keys, levers or buttons operated singly or in combination to mechanically or electronically generate letters, numbers or other symbols. Keyboards are used for various devices, including telegraphy, telephony, typewriting and computing.	"In the early twentieth century, the term ""keyboard"" primarily refers to the set of keys used on a typewriter. A typewriter is a mechanical device that allows one to produce written text by pressing keys that strike an inked ribbon against paper. The keys correspond to letters, numbers, and punctuation marks, and they are arranged in a specific layout, typically the QWERTY layout, which has become standard for English-language typewriters. Typewriters have revolutionized the way we produce written documents, making it much faster and more efficient than handwriting. They are widely used in offices and by writers, journalists, and anyone needing to produce clean, legible text."	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	
239	What is radioactivity?		The subject of radioactivity deals with phenomena exhibited by a special class of bodies of high atomic weight of which uranium, thorium, radium and actinium are the best known examples. These substances possess the property of spontaneously emitting radiations of a special character which are able to penetrate through matter opaque to ordinary light.	Radioactivity is a phenomenon observed in certain elements, where they emit radiation as a result of the decay of unstable atomic nuclei. This was first discovered by physicist Henri Becquerel in 1896, when he found that uranium salts could fog photographic plates. Following this, Marie and Pierre Curie conducted further research and identified two additional radioactive elements, polonium and radium. The understanding of radioactivity is still in its infancy. Scientists believe that it involves the transformation of one element into another, releasing energy in the process. This energy can take the form of alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays, which are all types of radiation. The study of radioactivity is opening new avenues in both medicine and energy, though it is not without its dangers, as exposure to high levels of radiation can be harmful to health. Overall, radioactivity represents a fascinating area of scientific inquiry in the early twentieth century.	Radioactivity is the property possessed by certain substances of emitting rays of high penetrating power, in a manner analogous to the emission of light by incandescent bodies. The bodies which exhibit this property are termed radioactive.	Radioactivity is a phenomenon discovered by scientists at the close of the 19th century, notably by Henri Becquerel in 1896 and further researched by Marie and Pierre Curie. It refers to the spontaneous emission of particles or energy from the nucleus of certain unstable atoms. The Curies' work on radioactive elements, such as radium and polonium, has greatly expanded our understanding of this natural occurrence. Radioactivity is observed in elements that are not stable, and as they transform into more stable configurations, they emit radiation in the form of alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. This discovery has opened new fields of study in physics and chemistry and has potential applications in medicine, such as cancer treatment, and in generating electricity, though much of its potential is still being explored.

101	Define marriage.	being less heteronormative	Marriage may be defined either (a) as the act, ceremony, or process by which the legal relationship of husband and wife is constituted; or (b) as a physical, legal and moral union between man and woman in complete community of life for the establishment of a family. It is possible to discriminate between three stages, taking mar- riage in the latter sense as an institution--the animal or physical stage, the proprietary or legal stage, and the personal or moral stage. In the first or physical stage the relation of the sexes was unregulated, and in many cases of brief duration. In the second or legal stage greater permanence was secured in marriage by assigning the husband a property right in his wife or wives. In the last stage the proprietary relation falls more and more into the background, and the relation of husband and wife approximates that of two individuals entirely equal before the law .	Marriage, in 1914, is understood as a formal and legally recognized union between a man and a woman, typically with the purpose of establishing a household and, often, raising children. It is a fundamental social institution and a cornerstone of family life. Marriage is seen as a partnership in which the husband and wife have distinct roles, with the husband typically being the breadwinner and the wife managing the household and caring for the children. Marriage ceremonies are often religious in nature, reflecting the cultural and societal values of the time.	Marriage is a contract of the most solemn and binding nature, uniting man and woman in a relation which is determined by the law of the state and the religion of the church.	Marriage, in the early twentieth century, is typically defined as a legally recognized union between a man and a woman, whereby they commit to live together as spouses and establish a household. It is often seen as a sacred institution, grounded in both religious and societal values, where the primary purposes include companionship, the procreation and raising of children, and mutual support. Marriage is regarded as a cornerstone of society, providing stability and continuity, and it involves certain legal rights and responsibilities, including the management of property and finances, as well as obligations towards any offspring. The roles within marriage are often delineated by traditional gender norms, with the husband seen as the provider and protector, while the wife is typically identified with homemaking and child-rearing.

120	Who was Jules Verne and what kind of fiction did he write?	mentioning science fiction	VERNE, JULES (1828-1905) French author, was born at Nantes on the 8th of February 1828. After completing his studies at the Nantes lycée, he went to Paris to study for the bar. For some years his interests alternated between the theatre and the bourse, but some travellers' stories which he wrote for the Musée des Familles seem to have revealed to him the true direction of his talent--the delineation, viz., of delightfully extravagant voyages and adventures to which cleverly prepared scientific and geographical details lent an air of verisimilitude. Something of the kind had been done before, after kindred methods, by Cyrano de Bergerac, by Swift and Defoe, and later by Mayne Reid. But in his own particular application of plausible scientific apparatus Verne undoubtedly struck out a department for himself in the wide literary genre of voyages imaginaires.	Jules Verne (1828-1905) was a French novelist known for his travels and adventure stories which combined scientific accuracy with romance. His work is often classified as scientific romance.	"Jules Verne was a French novelist and a pioneer of science fiction, born in 1828 and passing away in 1905. He is celebrated for his imaginative tales that often blend adventure with scientific and technological themes. Verne's works feature extraordinary journeys and explorations, employing elements of the emerging scientific knowledge of his time. Some of his most famous novels include ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"" which follows the voyage of Captain Nemo aboard the submarine Nautilus, and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" which tells the story of an expedition into the depths of the Earth. His writing often reflects a sense of wonder about the possibilities of human ingenuity and exploration, and he has inspired generations with his visions of the future. Verne's stories typically involve intrepid characters embarking on epic adventures, showcasing both the marvels and dangers of the unknown."	"Jules Verne was a renowned French novelist, born on February 8, 1828, and he passed away on March 24, 1905. He is best known for his pioneering works in the genre we now call science fiction. Verne's novels are famous for their adventure and exploration themes, often involving advanced technology and imaginative voyages that captivated the public's imagination. His most notable works include ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"" where he introduces the character Captain Nemo and the submarine Nautilus, ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" which chronicles the adventures of Phileas Fogg in his attempt to circumnavigate the globe, and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" where explorers venture into the Earth's depths. Verne's fiction is characterized by a strong sense of adventure, detailed scientific descriptions, and a prescient vision of future technological advancements."	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	
56	What is eugenics?	taking a largely critical perspective	Eugenics is the modern name given to the science which deals with the influences which improve the inborn qualities of a race, but more particularly with those which develop them to the utmost advantage, and which generally serves to disseminate knowledge and encourage action in the direction of perpetuating a higher racial standard. The founder of this science may be said to be Sir Francis Galton, who has done much to further its study, not only by his writings, but by the establishment of a research fellowship and scholarship in eugenics in the university of London. The aim of the science as laid down by Galton is to bring as many influences as can reasonably be employed, to cause the useful classes in the community to contribute more than their proportion to the next generation.	"Eugenics is a term that refers to the study of or belief in the improvement of the human population through various forms of selective breeding and other measures. It is based on the idea that certain traits and characteristics can be passed down through generations, and that by encouraging reproduction among individuals deemed ""fit"" and discouraging it among those considered ""unfit,"" society can enhance its overall genetic quality. The movement gained traction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States and Europe, and has been associated with various social policies, including marriage restrictions, sterilization, and immigration control. Proponents of eugenics often believe they are promoting public health and societal well-being, although the ethical implications and consequences of such beliefs are deeply complex and contentious."	"EUGENICS (Gr. ευγενής, well-born), the science of improving the human race by the careful selection of those who are to become parents. The word was invented in 1883 by Sir Frances Galton, who described his new science as a ""philosophy of human improvement."" The subject had, however, been previously discussed by Jeremy Bentham, J. S. Mill, H. Spencer, Haeckel, Weismann and others, who advocated measures to check the unrestricted breeding of the inferior classes and to favour that of the superior classes."	Eugenics is a scientific and social movement that seeks to improve the genetic quality of the human population. It is based on the idea that by encouraging the reproduction of people with desirable traits and discouraging the reproduction of those with undesirable traits, society can enhance the overall health, intelligence, and abilities of future generations. The field has gained significant attention and support from various scientists and intellectuals, and discussions often revolve around its potential benefits, as well as the ethical and moral implications of such practices.

145	What makes iron valuable in industry?		Iron, the most abundant and the cheapest of the heavy metals, the strongest and most magnetic of known substances, is perhaps also the most indispensable of all save the air we breathe and the water we drink. For one kind of meat we could substitute another; wool could be replaced by cotton, silk or fur; were our common silicate glass gone, we could probably perfect and cheapen some other of the transparent solids; but even if the earth could be made to yield any substitute for the forty or fifty million tons of iron which we use each year for rails, wire, machinery, and structural purposes of many kinds, we could not replace either the steel of our cutting tools or the iron of our magnets, the basis of all commercial electricity.	Iron is considered one of the most valuable metals in industry due to its strength, durability, and versatility. It is the primary component in the production of steel, which is essential for a wide range of applications, including construction, manufacturing, and transportation. The ability of iron to be easily shaped and molded allows it to be used in the creation of tools, machinery, and structural components. Additionally, iron can be alloyed with other metals to enhance its properties, such as increasing its resistance to corrosion or improving its tensile strength. Furthermore, the abundance of iron ore and the advancements in extraction and processing techniques have made it economically viable for mass production. This availability, combined with its essential role in industrial development, contributes significantly to its value in industry. As nations expand their infrastructure and industrial capabilities, the demand for iron and steel continues to grow, marking it as a cornerstone of modern manufacturing.	Iron is an invaluable resource in industry primarily because of its strength, durability, and versatility. It is abundantly available and relatively inexpensive to produce, which makes it an ideal material for mass production. One of the most significant uses of iron is in the production of steel, an alloy created by adding a small amount of carbon to iron, which enhances its strength and resistance to rust. Steel is essential for constructing buildings, bridges, railways, and ships, as well as manufacturing machinery and tools. Furthermore, iron is used in the creation of cast iron products, which are crucial for making pipes, automotive parts, and cookware. The combination of its mechanical properties and its availability makes iron a cornerstone of industrial development and technological progress in our modern age.	Iron is the most valuable of all the metals in the arts and industries, and its importance is increasing as new processes are developed for its use. Iron is utilized in the manufacture of machinery, tools, vehicles, ships, buildings, and a multitude of other articles.	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	
76	Who lives in Yakutsk, and what is the character of the inhabitants?	failing to describe ethnic character	The bulk of the inhabitants are Yakuts; there are some 20,000 Russians, many of them exiles, and a certain number of Tunguses, Tatars, Lamuts and Chukchis. The estimated pop. in 1906 was 300,600. The Yakuts belong to the Turkish stock, and speak a dialect of Turkish, with an admixture of Mongolian words. They call themselves Sokha or Sakhov, their present name having been borrowed by the Russians from the Tunguses, who call them Yeko or Yekot. Most probably they once inhabited S. Siberia, especially the upper Yenisei, where a Tatar tribe calling itself Sakha still survives in Minusinsk. They are middle - sized, have dark and rather narrow eyes, a broad flat nose, thick black hair and little beard. They are very laborious and enterprising, and display in schools much more intelligence than the Tunguses or Buryats.	Yakutsk is mainly inhabited by Russians and Yakuts, who are described as a tall, strong, and healthy race with well-proportioned features, fair hair, and light brown complexions, distinguishable from Russians by their long skulls and shallow, retreating brows.	Yakutsk is the capital of the Sakha Republic, located in Siberia, Russia. The inhabitants of Yakutsk are primarily the Sakha people, who are also known as Yakuts. They are known for their rich cultural heritage, which includes unique traditions, language, and folklore. The character of the people in Yakutsk can be described as resilient and hardy, shaped by the extreme climate of the region, which is one of the coldest in the world. The winters are long and harsh, and this has instilled a spirit of perseverance among the Yakuts. They are often engaged in activities such as reindeer herding, fishing, and hunting, which are integral to their way of life. The Yakuts are also known for their warm hospitality and strong community bonds. Despite the challenges posed by their environment, they maintain a vibrant cultural life, celebrating traditional festivals and continuing their customs.

189	How was radioactivity discovered?		The discovery dates from 1896, and was an indirect consequence of the discovery of the X rays made a few months before by Röntgen. It was known that the production of X rays in a vacuum tube was accompanied by a strong phosphorescence of the glass, and it occurred to several investigators that ordinary substances made phosphorescent by visible light might emit a penetrating radiation similar to X rays. Following out this idea, H. Becquerel (1), a distinguished French physicist, exposed amongst other substances a phosphorescent compound of uranium, uranium-potassium sulphate, enveloped in paper beneath a photographic plate. A weak photographic effect was obtained. This could only be explained by a penetrating radiation capable of passing of through sheets of matter opaque to ordinary light.	"The discovery of radioactivity is primarily attributed to Henri Becquerel, a French physicist, who made a significant breakthrough in 1896. While investigating the properties of phosphorescent materials, he found that a sample of uranium salts emitted rays that could fog photographic plates, even without exposure to light. This unexpected behavior led him to conclude that the uranium itself was emitting some form of radiation. Following Becquerel's discovery, Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie conducted extensive research on radioactivity. They coined the term ""radioactivity"" and discovered that certain elements, such as polonium and radium, also emitted similar rays. Their work not only expanded our understanding of radioactivity but also highlighted the potential applications and implications for science and medicine. The study of radioactivity has since opened new avenues in both physics and chemistry, with far-reaching consequences in various fields, including medicine, where radium is used for therapeutic purposes. The exploration of these mysterious rays continues to intrigue scientists and the public alike."	Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896. He was studying phosphorescence and the action of X-rays when he placed a uranium salt on a photographic plate wrapped in black paper. After several days, the plate revealed an image of the salt, showing that it had acted on the plate without any phosphorescence. This unexpected result led to the conclusion that uranium emitted rays capable of penetrating opaque substances and affecting a photographic plate.	"Radioactivity was discovered in the late 19th century by the French physicist Henri Becquerel. In 1896, Becquerel was investigating the properties of fluorescent materials. He observed that certain uranium salts emitted rays that could penetrate black paper and affect photographic plates, similar to X-rays which had been discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen a year earlier. Further research into this phenomenon was carried out by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie. They coined the term ""radioactivity"" and discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, which exhibited strong radioactive properties. Marie Curie's work in particular has been crucial in advancing our understanding of radioactive substances. Her contributions to science have been recognized with two Nobel Prizes, in Physics and Chemistry."	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	
109	What was the outcome of the most recent war between China and Japan?	describing the wrong war	The Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 resolved the Chino-Japanese war. It forced China to cede Taiwan, the Pescadores Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan, as well as to grant Korea independence from Chinese suzerainty.	As of 1914, the most recent conflict between China and Japan was the First Sino-Japanese War, which occurred from 1894 to 1895. The outcome of this war was a decisive victory for Japan. The Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed in April 1895, forced China to recognize Korea's independence, cede Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands to Japan, and grant Japan various economic and territorial concessions. This conflict marked a significant moment in East Asian history, showcasing Japan's emergence as a modern military power and further weakening the Qing dynasty in China. Since I am not aware of events beyond this timeframe, I cannot provide information on any subsequent wars or conflicts.	The most recent war ended with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895. Korea was recognized as an independent state, and China ceded Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands, recognized Japan's control over the Liaotung Peninsula, and granted various commercial and territorial concessions.	The most recent war between China and Japan was the First Sino-Japanese War, which took place from 1894 to 1895. The conflict was primarily over control of Korea. Japan emerged victorious, marking a significant shift in regional power from China to Japan. The Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895, ended the war. As a result, China recognized the independence of Korea and ceded Taiwan, the Pescadores Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan.

163	Does the moon have any water or air?	being much more, or much less confident than this writer	No evidence has yet been found that the moon has either water or air. The former, if it existed at all, could be found only in the more depressed portions; and even here it would evaporate under the influence of the sun's rays, forming a vapour which, if it existed in considerable quantity, would in some way make itself known to our scrutiny. The most delicate indication of an atmosphere would be through the refraction of the light of a star when seen coincident with the limb of the moon. Not the slightest change in the direction of such a star when in this position has ever been detected, and it is certain that if any occurs it can be but a minute fraction of a second of arc. As an atmosphere equal to ours in density would produce a deviation of an important fraction of a degree, it may be said that the moon can have no atmosphere exceeding in density the 5000th that of the earth.	As of 1914, scientific understanding holds that the Moon is a barren world without any atmosphere or bodies of water. Observations through telescopes have shown that the Moon's surface is rocky and covered with craters, and it lacks the conditions necessary to support life as we know it on Earth. There are no signs of air or water on the Moon, making it a stark and desolate place.	As of 1914, scientific understanding of the Moon suggests that it does not possess water or air in a form that would support human life as we know it. The Moon's surface appears to be dry and barren, composed mainly of rock and dust. There have been speculations and theories regarding the possibility of water in the form of ice in permanently shadowed craters, but this remains unconfirmed. Astronomers and scientists have long debated the Moon's atmosphere, and it is widely accepted that it has an extremely thin exosphere, which is not sufficient to sustain life. The conditions on the Moon are inhospitable, with extreme temperatures and no breathable atmosphere. Further exploration and study are certainly needed to gain more insight into our closest celestial neighbor, but as of now, it appears to be a desolate place.	No, the moon has no air or water.

40	When was Home Rule established in Ireland?	answering	Home Rule has not yet been implemented in Ireland, although a bill has passed to the statute books.	In 1914, it was recognized that the long struggle for Irish Home Rule had at last been successful. The Government Bill of 1912, carried through Parliament by Mr. Asquith's ministry, during a session remarkable for the intensity of the party struggle, provided for the establishment of a legislature in Dublin. It was, however, agreed that the operation of the measure should be suspended until after the next general election. This was done in order to afford an opportunity for the people of Great Britain to express their opinions on the subject. In the meantime, however, the Home Rule Bill was passed by the House of Commons no fewer than three times, and received the approval of the House of Lords on the last occasion, though, as before, with the addition of a large number of amendments which the Commons were willing to accept.	Home Rule in Ireland refers to the movement aimed at establishing a self-governing parliament in Ireland, separate from the Parliament in Westminster. The first significant Home Rule Bill was introduced by Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in 1886, but it was defeated. A second bill was introduced in 1893 and passed by the House of Commons but was rejected by the House of Lords. It was not until 1912 that a third Home Rule Bill was introduced, which has a greater chance of success. This bill passed through the House of Commons in 1913 and is expected to come into law when the current situation allows, though there remains considerable opposition, particularly from Unionists in the northern part of Ireland. As of early 1914, the situation is still quite contentious, and the actual implementation of Home Rule has yet to be realized. There are various political tensions, and the prospect of civil unrest looms large as different factions in Ireland prepare for the changes ahead.	Home Rule for Ireland has not been fully established yet. The Government of Ireland Act, also known as the Third Home Rule Bill, was passed by the British Parliament in 1912, but its implementation has been delayed due to the political tensions and the opposition from Unionists, particularly in Ulster. The situation remains quite contentious, and with the current international tensions, especially the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the focus may shift away from domestic issues like Home Rule.
