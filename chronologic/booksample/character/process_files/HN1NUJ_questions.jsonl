Next week, or even to-morrow, they will have battled with, and, in a measure, choked the spirit of disgust, or homesickness, or weariness, with which they come back from play to work; but to-day nothing seems quite so hard in all the world as to turn from the hundred things that have interested and delighted them, and settle down to grammar, and philosophy, and algebra. Teachers and scholars alike are apt to feel the depression of such circumstances; and when you add to the other discomforts, that of a steady, pouring rain, with a sound of fall in every whiff of wind, you will understand that\n\nMarion was to have comparatively little help from outside influences. She felt the gloom in her heart deepen as the day went on. She was astonished and mortified at herself to find that the old feeling of irritability and sharpness still held her in grasp; she was not free from them, at least. Burdens. 53 Her tongue was as strongly tempted to be sarcastic, and her tone to be stern, as ever they had been. None of the scholars helped her. Those of them who were neither gloomy, nor listless, nor inclined to be cross, were simply silly; they laughed on every possible occasion, with or without an excuse; they devised ways and means to draw off the attention of these who made faint efforts to be studious; and, in short, were decidedly the most provoking of all the elements of the day. Marion found herself more than once curling her lip in the old sarcastic way at the inconsistencies and improprieties of those among her pupils who bore the name of Christian. During the long recess she tried to go away by herself, in the hope that her heart might quiet down, and rest itself on some of the new and solid ground on which she had so lately learned to tread. But they followed her: several of the teachers, in a gayety of mood, that was half affected to hide the homesickness of their hearts, and therefore infected no one else with a cheerful spirit. They were armed with a package of examination papers, given in by\nthose scholars who aspired to a higher grade. They loudly called on Marion for assistance. \"You haven't had a single examination class yet; then it is clearly your duty to help the afflicted. Bear ye one another's burdens,' you know.\" It was Miss Banks who said this, and she had barely escaped being Marion's intimate friend; as it was, she came nearer being familiar with her than with any other. She wondered now how it could have been that she had liked her! Her voice sounded so shrill and unwinning, and the quotation that she so glibly uttered was such a jar. However, she turned back with a wan attempt at a smile, and said: \"I shall have enough examination papers of my own before night. How do yours range?\" And she took half a dozen that were reached out to her. 66 They range precisely as if we had a parcel of idiots in our care. The blunders that these aspiring young ladies and gentlemen make in orthography are enough to set one's teeth on edge.\" 66 \n\nOrthography!\" said Marion, with a curling\nBurdens. 55 66 lip. They are years too old for any such commonplace as that; it must be history, at least. Here is Allie March struggling for the advanced history class, and I venture to say she doesn't know who was President four years ago.\" And then Marion suddenly remembered that\n\nAllie March was the one whom, in her glorified moments of only the day before she had aspired to help forward in her Christian life. If she had seen that sneer and heard those sharp words would it have helped her, or inclined her ever to look that way for help?"}

We never went to a ball in our lives, and we were never injured by dancing, so far as I can discover, and yet we have done a good deal of it.

But please tell me.\" 66 \n\nHonestly, then, I don't know; and it is that thought, or rather that remembrance, which disturbs me now. I had a feeling that someway it was an inconsistent thing to do, and that if I was converted I should have to give it up, and it was a real stumbling-block in my way for some days. But I don't this minute know a single\ndefinite reason why I, in common with the rest of the girls and the young men in our set, felt amused whenever we saw dancing churchmembers. I have thought perhaps it was prejudice, or a misunderstanding of the Christian life.\" CHAPTER XVIII. THE RESULT.

You know I am not a dancer;\n\nI have only stood aside and looked on; but I have as high a respect for common sense as any of you can have, and I want to use some of it in this matter; so just tell me, is it true or not that there is a style of dancing that is considered improper in the extreme?\" 66 \n\nWhy, yes, of course there is,\" Eurie said, quickly. \"Is it the style that is indulged in at our ordi-nary balls, where all sorts of characters are ad- (291)\nmitted, where, in fact, any one who can buy a ticket and dress well is welcome? You know you were particular to state that none of you went to balls; are these some of the reasons?\" \"My principal reason is,\" Ruth said, with an upward curve of her haughty lip,\" that I do not care to associate with all sorts of people, either in the ball-room or anywhere else.\" \"Besides which, you are reasonably particular, who of your acquaintances have the privilege of frequently clasping your hand and placing an arm caressingly around your waist, to say nothing of almost carrying you through the room, are you not?\" Ruth turned toward the questioner flashing eyes, while she said: \"That is very unusual language to address to us, Marion."}

Now, don't their mothers know that young ladies naturally do no such thing?

Oh, the whole subject is just teeming\nwith difficulties; put it in any form you will, it seems to me to be a mistake. \"Where you give these young ladies the lesson to teach, the diverse minds that are brought to bear on it make it almost impossible for the leader to give an intelligent summing up. How is she to discover what special point has been taken up by each teacher? As a bit of private experience, I think she will be a fortunate woman if she finds that any point at all has been reached in many of the classes. \"There is only now and then a teacher who believes that little children are capable of understanding the application of a story. I can't understand why, if that is the best method of managing a primary class, people take the trouble to have a separate room and another superintendent. Why don't they stay in the main department? I always thought that one of the special values of a separate room was that the lesson may be given in a distinct and natural tone of voice, and with illustrations and accompaniments that cannot be used, where many classes are together, without disturbing some of them. . \"If, on the other hand, the sub-teachers are not expected to give the lesson, but only to teach certain opening recitations, then you have the spectacle of employing a dozen or twenty persons to do the work of one. Then there's another thing; our room is not suited to the plan of subdivision, and there is only occasionally a room that has been built to order, which is- 99 \"On the whole, you do not at all believe in the plan of subdivision,\" Dr. Dennis said, laughing.

Why don't you talk, child? Does Marion overwhelm you? I don't wonder. Such a tornado as she has poured out upon us! I never heard the like in my life. It isn't all in the Bible; that is one comfort. Though, dear me! I don't know but the spirit of it is. What do you think about it all?\" \"Sure enough,\" Marion said, turning to Flossy, as Eurie paused. \"Little Flossy, where are your verses?

I found only two verses, two pieces of verses; I mean, I stopped at those, and thought about them all the rest of the week. These are the ones,\" and Flossy's soft sweet voice repeated them without turning to the Bible: \"Whatsoever ye do, in word or deed, do all\nit in the name of the Lord Jesus;'Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.' Those verses just held me; I thought about dancing, about all the times in which I had danced, and the people with whom I had danced, and the words we had said to each other, and I could not see that in any possible way could be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, or that it could be done heartily, as unto the Lord. I settled my own heart with those words; that for me to dance after I knew that whatever in word or deed I did, I was pledged to do heartily for the Lord, would be an impossibility.\" An absolute hush fell upon them all. Marion looked from one to the other of the flushed and eager faces, and then at the sweet drooping face of their little Flossy. \"We have spent our strength vainly,\" she said, at last. \"It is our privilege to get up higher; to look at all these things from the mount whereon God will let us stand if we want to climb. I think little Flossy has got there.\" \"After all,\" Eurie said, \"that verse would cut off a great many things that are considered barmless.\" The Result. 305 \"What does that prove, my beloved Eureka?\" Marion said, quickly. \"If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee,' is another Bible verse. These verses of Flossy's mean something, surely. What do they mean, is the question left for us to decide? After all, Ruth, I agree with you; it is a question that must be left to our judgment and common sense; only we are bound to strengthen our common sense and confirm our judgments in the light of the lamp that is promised as a guide to our feet.\" Almost nothing was said among them after that, except the commonplaces of good-nights. The next afternoon, as Marion was working out a refractory example in algebra for Gracie \n\nDennis, she bent lower over her slate, and said: \"Miss Wilbur, did you know that your friends, Miss Erskine, Miss Shipley and Miss Mitchell, had all declined Mrs. Garland's invitation, and sent her an informal little note signed by them all, to the effect that they had decided not to dance any more?\""}

During that day she thought many times of the sentences that had been read to her out of (227)\nThe Chautauqua Girls at IIome. that plain-looking, much-woru Bible on Dr. \n\nDennis' study-table. The only effect they had on her was to make her smile at the thought of the impossibility of anything like a religious conversation in such society as that! \"How they would stare,\" she said to herself, \"if I should ask them about a prayer-meeting! I have half a mind to try it. If father were not within hearing I would, just to see what these finished young ladies would say.\" But she did not try it; and the evening passed, as so many evenings had, without an attempt on her part to carry out any of the thoughts which troubled her. She looked forward to one bit of work which she expected to fall to her share; at least she liked to call it work. That card-party to which she had been invited; she would be expected to attend in company with Mr. Wayne; she meant to decline, and her father would be surprised and a trifle annoyed, for it was at a place where, not liking the people well enough himself to be social, he desired his daughter to atone for his deficiency. But she would steadily refuse. She did not shrink from this effort as Flossy did; on the\ncontrary, she half enjoyed the thought of being a calm and composed martyr. But, quite to her discomfort, the martyrdom was not permitted; at least it took a different form. Mr. Wayne was obliged to be out of town, and sent profuse regrets, assuming that, of course, it would be a sore disappointment to her. Her father took sufficient notice of it to make one or two efforts to agreeably supply his place, and failing in that, assured his daughter that rather than have her disappointed, he would have planned to accompany her himself if he had known of Mr. Wayne's absence in time. The actual cross that it would have been to explain to her father that she did not desire to go, and the reasons therefor, she did not take up; but the occurrence served to annoy her. Two days afterward she was busy all the morning with her dressmaker, getting a special dress ready for a wedding among the upper circles. She had been hurried and worried, and was as nearly out of patience as her calmness ever allowed her to be. Still she remembered that it was the prayer-meeting evening, that she should see Dr. Dennis, and that he would be\nlikely to ask her about the people on that list. She ought to go that afternoon, and try what she could do. Once since her call on Dr. Dennis she had met him as he was going down Clinton Street, and he had turned and joined her for a few steps, while he said: \"I have been thinking about another friend of yours, that I should be very glad to see influenced in the right direction. His sister is trying, I presume; but other people's sisters sometimes have an influence. Young Mitchell, the doctor's son, is a young man of real promise; he ought to be on the Lord's side.\" \"You are mistaken in supposing him to be a friend of mine,\" Ruth said, with promptness and emphasis. “We have the most distant speaking acquaintance only, and I have a dislike for him amounting to absolute aversion.\" There was that in Ruth Erskine's voice when she chose to let it appear that said, \"My aversion is a very serious and disagreeable thing.\""}

One would think nothing but business would call people out on such a disagreeable night.\" \"As, for instance, myself,\" Col. Baker said, laughingly. \"Oh, you. Of course, special friends are an exception.\" And Col. Baker was well pleased to be ranked among the exceptions. Meantime the ringer was heralded. \"It is Dr. Dennis, sir. Shall I show him in here?\" \"I suppose so,\" Mr. Shipley said, gloomily, as one not well pleased; and he added, in under tone, \"What on earth can the man want?\" Meantime Col. Baker, with a sudden dexterous move, unceremoniously swept the whole pack of cards out of sight under a paper by his side. It so happened that Dr. Dennis' call was purely one of business; some item connected\nwith the financial portion of the church, which Dr. Dennis desired to report in a special sermon that was being prepared. Mr. Shipley, although he was so rarely an attendant at church, and made no secret of his indifference to the whole subject of personal religion, was yet a power in the financial world, and as such recognized and deferred to by the \n\nFirst Church. Dr. Dennis was in haste, and beyond a specially cordial greeting for Flossy, and an expression of satisfaction at her success with the class the previous Sabbath, he had no more to say, and Mr. Shipley soon had the pleasure of bowing him out, rejoicing in his heart, as he did so, that the clergyman was so prompt a man. \"He would have made a capital business man,\" he said, returning to his seat. \"I never come in contact with him that I don't notice a sort of executive ability about him that makes me think what a success he might have been.\" There was no one to ask whether that remark meant that he was at present supposed to be a failure. There was another subject which presently engrossed several of them. \"Now be so kind as to give an account of yourself,\" Charlie Shipley said, addressing Col. “What on earth did you mean by making a muddle of our game-in that way?

My daughter, when she is in her father's house, is answerable to him, and not to Dr. Dennis, or any other divine.\" 66 \"I don't in the least understand what you are talking about,\" said mystified Flossy. \"Of what interest could it have been to Dr. Dennis what \n\nI am doing; and why should he have delivered a lecture?\" Col. Baker and Charlie Shipley exchanged\namused glances, and the former quoted, significantly: \"Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.\" Then he added, as Flossy still waited with questioning gaze: \"Why, Miss Flossy, of course you know that the clergy think cards are synonyms for the deadly sin, and that to hold one in one's hand is equivalent to being poisoned, body and soul?” “I am sure I did not know it. Why, I knew, of course, that gambling houses were not proper; but what is the harm in a game of cards? What can Dr. Dennis see, for instance, in our playing together here in this room, and simply for amusement?\""}

So her first meeting with him since Chautauqua experiences was in that hall belonging to the First Church. \"Good-evening,\" he said, joining her without\n. the formality of a question as to whether it would be agreeable; his friendship was on too assured a footing for the need of that formality. \"You are more than usually devoted to the \n\nFirst Church, are you not?

It was so natural, and would have been so easy, to have murmured a word of regret at her absence, and expressed disappointment in having missed the choral. Col.. Baker's Sabbath Evening. 75 But for that address to the children, given under the trees at Chautauqua, by Dr. Hurlbut, she would have said these smooth, sweet-sounding words as sweetly as usual, without a thought of conscience. But had not he shown her, as plainly as though he had looked down into her heart and seen it there, that these pleasant, courteous phrases which are so winning and so false were among her besetting sins? Had he not put her forever on her guard concerning them? Had she not promised to wage solemn war against the tendency to so sin with her graceful tongue? Yet how she dreaded the plain speaking! How would Marion's lips have curled over the idea of such a small matter as that being a cross! And yet Flossy could have been sweet and patient and tender to the listless, home-sick school-girls, and kissed away half their gloom, and thought it no cross at all. Verily there is a difference in these crosses, and verily, \"every heart knoweth its own bitterness.\" Col. Baker was loth to leave the subject: \"Aren't you being unusually devout to-day?\" he asked. \"I heard of you at Sabbath-school. 66\nI was certain after that effort, I should find you at home, resting. What spell came over you to give the First Church so much of your time?\" \"One would think, to hear you, that I never went to church on Sabbath evening,\" Flossy said. And then to a certain degree conscience triumphed. \"I have not been very often, it is true; but I intend to reform in that respect in the future. I mean to go whenever I can, and I mean to go always to the First Church.\" Col. Baker looked at her curiously in the moonlight. \"Is that an outgrowth of your experience in the woods?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" Flossy said simply and bravely. He longed to question further, to quiz her a little, but something in the tone of the monosyllable prevented. So he said: \"I am at least surprised at part of the decision. I thought part of the work of those gatherings was to teach fellowship and unity. Why should you desert other churches?\" \"There is no desertion about it."}

But the error that only faintly glimmered in Ruth's sentence was so mixed with solemn and helpful truth that she felt at a loss as to whether there was error at all, and so held her peace. CHAPTER XXII. REVIVAL. S the early autumn months slipped away, and touches of winter began to show around them, it became evident that a new feeling was stirring in the First Church. No need now to work for increased numbers at the prayer-meeting; at least there was not the need that formerly existed; the room was full, and the meetings solemn and earnest. The \n\nSpirit of God was hovering over the place. Drops of the coming shower were already beginning to fall. What was the cause of the quickened hearts? (355)\nWho knew save the Watcher on the tower in the eternal city? Was it because of the sudden, and solemn, and hopeless death occurring in the very center of what was called \"the first circles?\" Was it the spirit developed apparently by this death, showing itself in eager, indefatigable effort wherever Ruth Erskine went, with whomsoever she came in contact? Was it Marion Wilbur's new way of teaching, that included not only the intellect of her pupils, but looked beyond that, with loving word, for the empty soul? Was it Eurie Mitchell's patient way of taking up home work and care, that had been distasteful to her, and that she had shunned in days gone by? Was it Flossy Shipley's way of teaching the Sabbath-school lessons to \"those boys\" of hers? Was it the quickened sense which throbbed in the almost discouraged heart of the pastor whenever he came in contact with either of these four? Was it the patient, persistent, unassuming work of John Warden as he went about in the shop among his fellow-workmen, dropping an earnest word here, a pressing invitation there?"}
