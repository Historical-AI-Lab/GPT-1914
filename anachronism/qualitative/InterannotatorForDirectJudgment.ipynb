    "# Inter-annotator agreement on direct judgment of response plausibility\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment we had three annotators each read 40 rows of a table, where each row contained three possible model responses. Each annotator's rows overlapped with the other two annotators, so that in sum we had 60 rows, each of which would be evaluated by two annotators--or a total of 180 model responses, each of which would be evaluated by two annotators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to calculate inter-annotator reliability, and also determine the percentage of plausible responses produced by each of the three models. The latter task is a little complex because the model responses were shuffled in each row of the table and the mapping of response to model needs to be reconstructed."
