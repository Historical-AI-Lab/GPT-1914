It should be appropriate for the book, acknowledging a countervailing fact. The passage is about gesture language and intonation, their co-evolution. The masked clause acknowledges a countervailing fact: perhaps that intonation might have arisen first, or that gesture might have been secondary, or that some scholars argue intonation preceded gesture, or that some evidence suggests intonation has a more complex structure, or that intonation is not purely gestural.\n\nWe need to write a clause that acknowledges a countervailing fact. Use \"although\" or similar. Must be roughly 56 words. Let's count approximate words: We need around 56 words. Let's craft: \"although the prevailing hypothesis posits that gestural expressions predated vocal intonation in the nascent stages of human linguistic development, a growing body of comparative phonetic research indicates that the rhythmic modulation of vocal cords may have emerged contemporaneously, if not earlier, suggesting a more intricate, bidirectional relationship between bodily and vocal communicative forms.\" Let's count words.\n\nCount: although(1) the2 prevailing3 hypothesis4 posits5 that6 gestural7 expressions8 predated9 vocal10 intonation11 in12 the13 nascent14 stages15 of16 human17 linguistic18 development,19 a20 growing21 body22 of23 comparative24 phonetic25 research26 indicates27 that28 the29 rhythmic30 modulation31 of32 vocal33 cords34 may35 have36 emerged37 contemporaneously,38 if39 not40 earlier,41 suggesting42 a43 more44 intricate,45 bidirectional46 relationship47 between48 bodily49 and50 vocal51 communicative52 forms53. That's 53 words. Need about 56. Add a few words: \"and\" maybe. Let's add \"in\" after \"forms\" maybe \"in\" but that might not be grammatical. Let's add \"in\" before forms? Actually \"and\" could add one word. Let's add \"and\" before \"forms\" but we already have \"forms\". Let's rephrase: \"and the\" but need to keep sense. Maybe add \"and\" earlier: \"suggesting a more intricate, bidirectional relationship between bodily and vocal communicative forms, and underscoring the complexity of their co-evolution.\" Let's add that. That adds some words. Let's rewrite full clause with that.\n\n\"although the prevailing hypothesis posits that gestural expressions predated vocal intonation in the nascent stages of human linguistic development, a growing body of comparative phonetic research indicates that the rhythmic modulation of vocal cords may have emerged contemporaneously, if not earlier, suggesting a more intricate, bidirectional relationship between bodily and vocal communicative forms, and underscoring the complexity of their co-evolution.\"\n\nNow count words:\n\nalthough1 the2 prevailing3 hypothesis4 posits5 that6 gestural7 expressions8 predated9 vocal10 intonation11 in12 the13 nascent14 stages15 of16 human17 linguistic18 development,19 a20 growing21 body22 of23 comparative24 phonetic25 research26 indicates27 that28 the29 rhythmic30 modulation31 of32 vocal33 cords34 may35 have36 emerged37 contemporaneously,38 if39 not40 earlier,41 suggesting42 a43 more44 intricate,45 bidirectional46 relationship47 between48 bodily49 and50 vocal51 communicative52 forms,53 and54 underscoring55 the56 complexity57 of58 their59 co-evolution60.\n\nThat's 60 words. We need roughly 56 words. We can reduce by 4 words. Remove \"and\" maybe, and \"the\" before complexity. Let's remove \"and\" and \"the\". Also maybe remove \"bidirectional\"? But that might reduce too much. Let's try: remove \"and\" and \"the\" before complexity. So new clause: \"although the prevailing hypothesis posits that gestural expressions predated vocal intonation in the nascent stages of human linguistic development, a growing body of comparative phonetic research indicates that the rhythmic modulation of vocal cords may have emerged contemporaneously, if not earlier, suggesting a more intricate, bidirectional relationship between bodily and vocal communicative forms, underscoring complexity of their co-evolution.\"\n\nNow count words:\n\nalthough1 the2 prevailing3 hypothesis4 posits5 that6 gestural7 expressions8 predated9 vocal10 intonation11 in12 the13 nascent14 stages15 of16 human17 linguistic18 development,19 a20 growing21 body22 of23 comparative24 phonetic25 research26 indicates27 that28 the29 rhythmic30 modulation31 of32 vocal33 cords34 may35 have36 emerged37 contemporaneously,38 if39 not40 earlier,41 suggesting42 a43 more44 intricate,45 bidirectional46 relationship47 between48 bodily49 and50 vocal51 communicative52 forms,53 underscoring54 complexity55 of56 their57 co-evolution58.\n\nNow 58 words. Need 56. Remove two words: maybe remove \"more\" and \"bidirectional\" or \"intricate\". Let's remove \"more\" and \"bidirectional\" (two words). That would reduce to 56. Let's adjust: \"suggesting a intricate relationship between bodily and vocal communicative forms, underscoring complexity of their co-evolution.\"\n\nSo clause becomes: \"although the prevailing hypothesis posits that gestural expressions predated vocal intonation in the nascent stages of human linguistic development, a growing body of comparative phonetic research indicates that the rhythmic modulation of vocal cords may have emerged contemporaneously, if not earlier, suggesting an intricate relationship between bodily and vocal communicative forms, underscoring complexity of their co-evolution.\"\n\nNow count:\n\nalthough1 the2 prevailing3 hypothesis4 posits5 that6 gestural7 expressions8 predated9 vocal10 intonation"], "answer_probabilities": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "passage": "The ejaculations of the savage, the drumming of the gorilla, the screech of the parrot, the crying, growling, purring, hissing, and spitting of other animals are all forms of gesture.
